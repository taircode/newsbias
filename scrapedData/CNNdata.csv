0," (CNN)A wave of ""smash-and-grab"" crimes is plaguing upscale stores in major US cities, with mobs of thieves making off with expensive goods in brazen, nighttime raids. At least 18 people broke into a Nordstrom department store in Los Angeles Monday night and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise, the city's police chief said.The thefts followed a rash of similar incidents over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. A group of thieves swarmed the Southland Mall in Hayward on Sunday evening, wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry store before grabbing items and fleeing.Three suspects were arrested Saturday night after a mob ransacked a Nordstrom department store in Walnut Creek, east of San Francisco. Some 80 suspects were involved, and they fled the outdoor mall in at least 10 different vehicles, police said. That robbery came after similar raids Friday night near San Francisco's Union Square, where thieves targeted Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Bloomingdale's stores, a Walgreens and cannibis dispensaries. And California isn't the only place grappling with ""smash-and-grab"" crimes. Fourteen robbers barged into a Louis Vuitton store in suburban Chicago last week and fled with more than $100,000 in handbags and other merchandise. So why so many recent incidents? Are they linked to the holiday season? Is it pandemic restlessness?  ""This has nothing to do with the pandemic,"" said Pete Eliadis, a former law enforcement official and founder of security company Intelligence Consulting Partners. ""The pandemic is overused at this point.""But security experts cited a mix of several other factors.Such cases aren't always a priority for law enforcement San Francisco has seen a surge in crime since it reopened in the pandemic. In the Central district, for example, larceny and theft incidents are up almost 88% from a year earlier, and overall crime is up almost 52%, according to police statistics.Many of the store thieves wear masks or hoods, making them difficult to identify even when they're spotted on security cameras.Police in Los Angeles and San Francisco have made some arrests, but thieves often face few consequences, Eliadis said. One reason for this is law enforcement's lack of resources, which means theft cases sometimes are put on the back burner, he said. And, he added, the ""defund the police"" movement has sapped some officers' morale.""There's no political will to prosecute the people in this climate. Why should a police officer waste time getting into an altercation when the person is not going to jail because it's overcrowded and a prosecutor is not going to prosecute that case because it's not high on the priority list?"" Eliadis said. ""The takeaway is we need the political will, more prosecution and backing of law enforcement.""Thieves may face few consequences The decriminalization of low-level offenses in some states has created opportunities for criminals to manipulate the system, said Lynda Buel, president of Ohio-based security consulting firm SRMC. For example, Proposition 47, a California ballot initiative passed in 2014, sought to alleviate prison overcrowding by reducing the penalties for some crimes. The measure raised the threshold for felony theft from $500 to $950.""For the low-level criminal, the benefit far outweighs the risk, since the threshold for a misdemeanor offense is $950 -- meaning that a person can steal up to that amount and only be charged with a misdemeanor,"" Buel said.Organized crime rings are often behind these types of ""smash-and-grab"" operations and pay low-level criminals to steal for them, she said.  Security experts said dismantling these sophisticated crime groups must be a law enforcement priority.""People see the ability to commit these 'smash-and-grab incidents' knowing that there is little consequence, especially if the thefts are kept below the threshold of a felony offense,"" Buel said. ""It's easy, it's fast, and the payback is good.""   The holidays provide more opportunities for theftIt's not unusual for ""smash and grabs"" to increase around the Christmas holiday season, Buel said. Stores stock up before the holidays, which means there's a bounty of merchandise to pick from. That means more opportunities and more convenience for the smash-and-grabbers, she said. But retail theft by organized gangs is not limited to the holiday season. In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law reinstating a task force to investigate organized theft at stores. ""This is not new in the state ... We've been organized in a very deliberative manner to address the issue of organized retail crime for a number of years,"" Newsom said. ""We are doubling down on those efforts today.""In Illinois, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in September that crime rings are costing retailers across the country an estimated $45 billion in annual losses. He created a task force to crack down on organized crime rings that target stores.""These brazen, violent crimes are committed by sophisticated criminal organizations that are involved in drug trafficking, human trafficking and other serious crimes,"" Raoul said.There are numerous places to sell stolen itemsOnce items are stolen, there are several ways to sell them -- all extremely easy and with little regulation and monitoring from law enforcement, experts said. Most items grabbed in such cases have no serial numbers, making tracing them almost impossible, Eliadis said. ""It is incredibly easy to sell stolen merchandise online through e-commerce platforms,"" Buel said. ""E-commerce has really taken off as the place to sell stolen goods.""Other thieves don't need to sell their stolen goods on Craigslist or eBay. They can also use flea markets, pawn shops and street vendors.  Thieves can sell expensive items at slashed prices, meaning there's no shortage of buyers, Eliadis added.The result is a ruthless cycle that affects everyone, Eliadis said. Some affected stores will shut down or relocate. And retailers plagued by thefts see their insurance rates and private security costs increase -- costs that eventually get passed on the customer. ",2
1," (CNN)At least 18 people broke into a high-end department store in Los Angeles and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise Monday night, the city's police chief said, in one of the country's latest store burglaries involving sizable groups of thieves.The group used a sledgehammer and an electric bicycle to smash a window, allowing them to enter the closed Nordstrom department store at The Grove retail complex in Los Angeles around 10:40 p.m. PT, city police said.The group, consisting of 18 to 20 people, stole at least $5,000 in merchandise and caused $15,000 in damage, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday at a city police commission meeting.Nearby police officers ""heard the event"" and saw vehicles driving away, and the officers pursued one of the vehicles, Moore said.The pursuit ended in South Los Angeles, and three people in the vehicle were arrested in connection with the burglary, Los Angeles police spokesman Officer Drake Madison told CNN.Officers recovered merchandise from the vehicle and one of the three people arrested, Moore said.Los Angeles police will increase overnight patrols at high-end retail stores starting Tuesday, Moore said.The burglary is one of the most recent in a series of similar crimes in some major US metropolitan areas, including San Francisco and Chicago.About 80 people were involved in what police are calling a ""smash-and-grab"" incident Saturday night at a Nordstrom location in Walnut Creek, near San Francisco. People fled the store in at least 10 different vehicles, Lt. Ryan Hibbs at the Walnut Creek Police Department told CNN. Three suspects were arrested.The manager of a nearby restaurant told CNN affiliate KPIX that the suspects were wearing masks and carried what appeared to be crowbars.""There was a mob of people,"" Brett Barrett said. ""The police were flying in. It was like a scene out of a movie. It was insane. ... It was a scary scene for a moment.""Police have not yet estimated a dollar amount for the stolen items, Hibbs said.The incident followed a series of similar thefts Friday night in Union Square and surrounding areas in San Francisco, including at a Louis Vuitton store, a Burberry store, a jewelry store, a Bloomingdale's, a Walgreens, cannabis dispensaries and even an eyeglass shop, San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said at a news conference Saturday.Similar crimes reported in IllinoisOn Wednesday, at least 14 people forced their way into a Louis Vuitton store in Oak Brook, Illinois, and made off with at least $100,000 in merchandise, according to CNN affiliate WLS, based on interviews with the Oak Brook Police Department.Police told WLS the individuals rushed into the store at Oak Brook Center Mall, took out garbage bags and began filling them with items. Surveillance video from the store, obtained by WLS, shows the chaotic scene as the masked shoplifters pour into the store grabbing handbags and other merchandise while shoppers rush out of the way.Investigators have information on the three vehicles the thieves drove away in, according to Police Chief James Kruger. Oak Brook is about 25 miles west of Chicago.Kruger told WLS his investigators are working with investigators in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, where police say eight people took off with $66,000 worth of merchandise from a Louis Vuitton store at Northbrook Court Mall in October.On November 1, at least 13 men wearing masks and gloves entered the same Louis Vuitton store and stole several items valued at $100,000. Northbrook is about 30 miles from Oak Brook. ""We don't know if there is an actual connection yet, but certainly there are similarities,"" Kruger said.",2

3,"New York (CNN Business)Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said theft is a growing problem at the company's stores — and it is implementing added security measure to safeguard employees and shoppers.""This is traumatizing for our associates and is unacceptable,"" Barry said on a call with analysts Tuesday. ""We are doing everything we can to try to create [an] as safe as possible environment.""Barry said the company is implementing a number of tactics to minimize theft and protect staff and customers. For example, Best Buy is locking up more products and hiring security when appropriate.Barry said organized retail crime is on the rise at Best Buy. The tactic involves an organized  ""gang"" of people who steal entire shelves of high-value products, such as electronics, to resell them for a profit. The crime surge is becoming such a problem that it is hitting Best Buy's (BBY) profits and could hurt its ability to retain and attract more employees in a tight labor market, Barry said in an interview Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""Some incidents involved individuals bringing a weapon, such as a gun or crowbar, she said.The retail industry is struggling to handle the escalation in organized retail theft. A 2020 survey of 61 retailers from the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade group, showed organized retail theft jumped nearly 60% from 2015 and cost stores an average of $719,548 per $1 billion dollars in sales.Smash and grab on the riseBarry's comments come on the heels of a string of retail thefts in San Francisco in just the last few days in which thieves targeted a Louis Vuitton store, a Burberry store, a jewelry store and Bloomingdale's and Walgreens locations.On Saturday, a Nordstrom (JWN) department store near San Francisco was ransacked in what police described as a ""smash-and-grab"" incident. Industry experts say store theft is now an acute problem and getting worse. ""While retailers have always suffered from general shoplifting there is a growing scourge of organized gangs which are stealing to order,"" said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. ""The gangs are much more dangerous for retailers and for customers shopping in stores,"" he said. ""The problem is that while store security and associates can take individual shoplifters to task, they are not able to do much against gangs as they are outnumbered.""Saunders said its local communities that will ultimately suffer if this trend isn't reversed. ""If theft grows too bad, then retailers will simply pull out of certain locations, as we have already seen with some of the drugstores,"" he said.",2
4,"London (CNN)A gang of jewelery thieves have been jailed for a string of burglaries on the homes of celebrities, where they made away with £26 million ($34.9 million) worth of luxury stolen goods.Jugoslav Jovanovic, Alessandro Donati and Alessandro Maltese targeted high profile figures, including soccer manager and former England player Frank Lampard, television presenter Christine Lampard, Formula 1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone and the late chairman of the Leicester City soccer club, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.Police described the thefts as the ""highest value series of residential burglaries in UK history."" The men were sentenced to lengthy jail terms on Monday after being convicted at an earlier hearing.The trio, from Milan, Italy, flew into the UK just days before committing their first burglary, where they stole items worth about £60,000 ($80,600) at an address in the upmarket London borough of Kensington and Chelsea on 1 December 2019, according to London's Metropolitan Police.Days later on December 10 they stole £1 million ($1.34 million) of watches and cash from an address in Knightsbridge.They then targeted a house on Palace Green, where they grabbed items worth more than £26 million, including diamonds, precious stones, watches and cash.Most of the stolen jewelry and watches have not been recovered, authorities said. Police said that the gang were so meticulous in keeping their identities hidden -- paying only in cash, wearing disguises and caps and never walking in a group -- that the ""three of them individually praised us for working out who they were and locating them.""From a 13-second clip of grainy CCTV footage showing the burglars creeping through the back garden of the Palace Green property and back out again, police were able to establish a crime scene.The security camera footage showed the group getting into an unknown black taxi during their getaway, which led officers to identify at least 1,007 cabs that were in the area at the time.Police attempted to trace every single taxi, and it was only in speaking to cab driver 1,004 that they traced the driver who picked the thieves up, and were able to determine a regular route for the gang.""This story is comparable to what you will see in a Hollywood movie but unfortunately this was real life and involved real victims,"" Detective Constable Andrew Payne, from Central Specialist Crime, said in a statement.Jovanovic, 24, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to money laundering, was sentenced to a total of 11 years in jail.Donati, 44, and Maltese, 45, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle and were both given sentences of eight years and nine months.'I feel unsafe in my home'In victim impact statements, the targets of the burglaries spoke of how the raids had affected them.""I would say that this incident has had a major impact on our general feeling of security, particularly with having a 16 month old baby,"" Frank Lampard said. ""The fact that my job means that I travel frequently again raises my concerns. Neither my wife nor I are sleeping too well as a consequence of this incident.""His wife, Christine Lampard, said she struggled to sleep since the burglary, adding: ""I am much more fearful of being alone in my own home, I am less trusting of visitors to the house and feel unsafe in my home. I have a young daughter and feel vulnerable in a home which I had previously always felt safe and happy in.""Meanwhile, the family of the late Srivaddhanaprabha said that their father's residence had previously been ""a place of reflection and to pray.""""We felt it was the strongest connection to him as he spent his last night there before his death. Since the burglary, our sacred and special connection has been damaged and violated beyond repair,"" they added.Ecclestone, daughter of former Formula 1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, said: ""I'm so scared I will not leave my daughter alone in the house at night because I just feel like the people I am meant to trust, I don't, I'm not sure that I can trust anyone.""""(My daughter) talks about burglars now as well, which is really really hard and that's the worst part trying to pretend to her nothing actually did happen, and to try to make her feel the house is a safe space,"" she added.",2
5,"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN)A jury has awarded more than $26 million in damages after finding the White nationalists who organized and participated in a violent 2017 rally here liable on a state conspiracy claim and other claims.But the jury in the federal civil trial said Tuesday it could not reach a verdict on two federal conspiracy claims.The violence during the Unite the Right rally turned the Virginia city into another battleground in America's culture wars and highlighted growing polarization. It was also an event that empowered White supremacists and nationalists to demonstrate their beliefs in public rather than just online.Though the jury deadlocked on the two federal conspiracy claims, it slammed the defendants on the other claims with major awards to the plaintiffs, who included town residents and counterprotesters injured in the violence four years ago.Some of the most prominent figures of the alt-right -- Jason Kessler, Matthew Heimbach, Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell -- were among the defendants.""We are thrilled that the jury has delivered a verdict in favor of our plaintiffs, finally giving them the justice they deserve after the horrific weekend of violence and intimidation in August 2017,"" plaintiffs' attorneys Roberta Kaplan and Karen Dunn said. ""Today's verdict sends a loud and clear message that facts matter, the law matters, and that the laws of this this country will not tolerate the use of violence to deprive racial and religious minorities of the basic right we all share to live as free and equal citizens.""One defense attorney called the verdict a win.""It's a politically charged situation. It's going to be hard to get 11 people to agree,"" said attorney Joshua Smith, who represented three defendants. ""I consider a hung jury to be a win, considering a disparity of resources.""The events surrounding August 11-12, 2017, saw White nationalists and supremacists marching through Charlottesville and the University of Virginia campus chanting, ""Jews will not replace us,"" ""You will not replace us"" and ""Blood and soil,"" a phrase evoking Nazi philosophy on ethnic identity. The violence -- which enveloped the rally to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee -- reached a crescendo when James Alex Fields Jr., who was protesting the statue's removal, sped his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Half of the $24 million in punitive damages awarded were against Fields. In addition, the jury awarded punitive damages against Kessler, Spencer and Cantwell at $700,000 each, and Heimbach for $500,000.Despite the large jury award, there's the question of whether the plaintiffs will see much of that money. Fields is serving multiple life sentences. Some of the other defendants -- individuals and White supremacist organizations -- have indicated they are financially stressed.""The defendants in the case are destitute, none of them have any money,"" Smith said. ""I don't know how any of the plaintiffs are going to get anything for any of this."" Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they intend to relitigate the two federal conspiracy charges.The first federal conspiracy claim was the most prominent against the defendants because it alleged the defendants conspired to commit racially motivated violence while the second alleged the defendants had knowledge of a conspiracy and failed to prevent it.""We intend to get a verdict on those counts in the future,"" Kaplan said.Amy Spitalnick, executive director for Integrity First for America, the group that funded the suit, called the multimillion dollar decision a message.""This verdict sends a very clear message that violent hate will not go unanswered,"" Spitalnick said. ""There will be very serious consequences for the sort of extremist violence we saw here four years ago. And that's incredibly powerful, particularly at a moment when we know that extremism is on the rise, when democracy is under threat, and when there has been so little accountability.""Millions in damages awardedA jury awarded the plaintiffs $11 million in punitive damages on a Virginia conspiracy claim. On that claim, each defendant is liable for $500,000 each. Five organizations are liable for $1 million each.The jury only awarded $7 to the plaintiffs in compensatory damages on the civil conspiracy claim.In general, compensatory damages compensate (or make whole) the injured party for their loss or injury. Punitive damages are considered punishment when the defendant's behavior is found to be particularly harmful, such as if the defendant intentionally engaged in willful misconduct.  For the claim that some defendants subjected plaintiffs to racial, religious or ethnic harassment, violence or vandalism, Kessler, Spencer, Cantwell, Elliott Kline and Robert ""Azzmador"" Ray were each found liable for punitive damages.Plaintiffs Natalie Romero and Devin Willis were awarded $250,000 each in compensatory damages.In the same claim, the jury also found Fields liable, but did not award any damages.It also found Fields liable for $12 million in punitive damages total for claims of assault or battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Jurors awarded $803,277 in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs for the assault or battery claim. On the other claim, the jury awarded $701,459 in compensatory damages.Fields didn't testify in the trial but was represented by an attorney.Lawsuit sought long-awaited consequencesA few criminal cases resulted from the events surrounding the rally -- including state and federal convictions of Fields, who is serving multiple life sentences for killing Heyer -- but there were no large-scale trials of organizers from the Justice Department under the Trump or Biden administrations.The civil lawsuit in federal court sought to impose consequences on those who planned the rally and Fields for the people he injured or traumatized when he ran his Dodge Challenger into the crowd. But even before the trial, the plaintiffs had won in some ways due to the national outrage over the violence. Richard Spencer stopped his public speaking tour and has called the case ""financially crippling."" Jeff Schoep and Heimbach renounced White supremacy and stopped organizing White power activity in public. Schoep gave the group he led for more than two decades, the National Socialist Movement, to a Black civil rights activist who died shortly thereafter. Identity Evropa, one of the groups named in the suit, rebranded under a new name twice before disbanding. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that even though the full verdict amounts likely won't be paid, the lawsuit will brings significant consequences. He compared the verdict with a decision in the 1980s in which a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center crippled the Ku Klux Klan.""It is a significant verdict,"" Toobin said of Tuesday's decision. ""It is important to realize as one of the defense attorneys said that these defendants don't have millions of dollars and they won't pay millions of dollars. But they will face consequences and they will face the prospect of having wages garnished, property taken.""Fourteen people and 10 White supremacist and nationalist organizations were originally named in the lawsuit that prompted the trial, but a few were not involved in the verdicts because they didn't show up for court and were the subjects of default judgments. In closing arguments last week, attorneys representing the plaintiffs told the jury that the defendants prepared for the ""Battle of Charlottesville"" and messages sent between them and their actions after the violence were proof of a conspiracy. Defense attorneys and Spence and Cantwell, represented themselves countered that none of the plaintiffs had proven the defendants had organized racial violence. The case was Sines v. Kessler.",2
6," (CNN)Many members within the House of Representatives have told CNN in recent days that they find themselves in a toxic work environment, wrought with bitter exchanges, threats and fears about what the erosion of decorum in the chamber will mean for a body that has still not recovered 10 months after the Capitol Hill riot.In interviews with more than a dozen members, CNN heard from Democrats and some Republicans who say things are as bad as they can remember, with no sign things will get better soon, and the fears and concerns aren't just coming from members, but their families as well.Last week alone, Democrats and two Republicans voted to censure Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican from Arizona, for posting an animé video depicting the killing of fellow member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York. Initially, Gosar took the video down, but he retweeted another tweet containing the video just an hour after he endured the highest form of rebuke a member can get in the House. As he took his punishment in the well of the House, he was surrounded by a group of colleagues rushing to his defense. His leadership never came to the floor to admonish him, only attacking the process Democrats were using. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado, defended Gosar on the floor by calling some of her progressive Democratic colleagues the ""Jihad squad,"" a term she defended to CNN on Friday. ""It is shocking to me that Leader McCarthy would stand for eight and a half hours spewing disinformation about a bill that is for the American people and yet not speak a word about the atrocity of his own member putting out a video that glorifies the murder of a colleague and threatens violence against the President of the United States,"" said Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania. ""I don't know where the next basement is.""It's all part of the challenge members are facing now in the House, and some have opted to retire rather than endure more caustic behavior. On the outskirts of the House chamber, metal detectors are still stationed at every door, a reminder of the fears that remain. And an effort to investigate the root cause of the attack on January 6 has been politicized and met with resistance by most Republicans. Some have even downplayed whether the events of that day were all that bad. It's a constant reminder for some members about the state of their workplace. ""January 6th made things so much worse. I was on the floor that day. That was a forever life-changing moment on a personal level, but it was also a moment that changed Congress,"" Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Illinois, told CNN. ""It started with the incessant lies that weren't challenged and were amplified to January 6th to a member of Congress threatening lives of friends and colleagues."" In an interview with Rep. John Garamendi, a Democrat from California, Garamendi's wife Patricia could be heard in the background during the interview responding along with her husband that yes, the threats were as bad as they had ever been. Patricia Garamendi, who works closely with other congressional spouses on events and provides guidance on how to navigate Congress, agreed to speak with CNN for the story. She said that it's the scariest time she can remember for the spouses of members who worry not just about their member of Congress, but their entire families.""It took away a lot of the fun. Service is hard. Travel is hard and the issues are hard, but when you are worried about your family, it has been difficult,"" she said. ""I mean some kids are being escorted to school."" 'I'm not running again'And those are just the security threats. A massive battle over Covid-19 has only exasperated the divisions. A handful of conservative members regularly defy the House speaker's mask mandate, racking up thousands of dollars in fines while some members publicly admit they aren't getting vaccinated. Standing on the steps of the US House Friday, Bustos told CNN that all of the bitterness and lies impacted her decision not to run for reelection. ""My interns are down there,"" she pointed. ""I always write them five pieces of advice and one of those is 'don't take things personally.' I've tried to live that in politics. This, you can't help but take personally. All of this has contributed to the fact that I'm not running again. I want to love what I do. I want to love who I work with. I want to respect the people I work with and that has been compromised in ways that I hope can be repaired at some point, but right now I do not feel like I can repair.""Some of the anxiety members feel stems from bitter disagreements with the opposite party, while others say the spiral of toxicity has metastasized even to how members within the same party engage with one another. For months, progressives and moderates in the Democratic party grappled with how to pass both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a Democrat-only bill to expand the social safety net. But the divisions within their ranks threatened both bills and resulted in sometimes public and pointed personal jabs.""Toxic is spot-on,"" Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from Florida, said. ""I think there is plenty of Dem-on-Dem violence as well as Republican and Democratic divisions. I think it is not conducive to a healthy legislative environment for colleagues to make these debates both so personal and caustic.""'People here need to get thicker skin'In a series of interviews with Republicans, many downplayed the divisions outright or blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for setting the wrong tone when she announced all members would need to walk through metal detectors to get to the House floor after the insurrection. ""I believe it is a consolidation of power in the Speaker's office in the House and an abuse of power by the Speaker because she has one-party control and she is completely shutting down the voices of the minority and hiding behind Covid to accomplish it,"" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers, a Republican from Washington state, told CNN. Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas who advocated ahead of January 6 to certify the electoral college results, told CNN that part of the problem is that members have not moved on from January 6th.""People here need to get thicker skin,"" Roy said. ""At some point here, you gotta let some things roll.""Asked if he was including the insurrection in the things that people needed to let ""roll,"" Roy said ""people here have got to get thicker skin about representing the people and doing their job and not making everything personal on the floor of the House.""'I feel safe, but it is incredibly concerning'But for some members, the threats are very personal. ""Congressman Boebert referred to us as the 'Jihad squad' on the House floor. What that does is it empowers and inspires people who want to do us harm, to actually go and do that harm. She is on the House floor spewing 'Jihad squad,' "" Rep. Jamaal Bowman said. ""I feel safe, but it is incredibly concerning that she is speaking this way and we have to respond to that in some way.""Ocasio-Cortez, who was the subject of Gosar's animé video, told CNN last week that sometimes it is impossible to separate the political from the personal, even as she has tried to build relationships with some Republicans. ""It is not just because they dislike me as a person. In fact, I have had many a Republican come to me on the House floor and say 'I tell folks back home that while I don't agree with you, I think you are a quite kind person.' I have had Republicans come up to me after the 6th, one of them even weeping and with guilt over what happened,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""So for some ... publicly, this is a performance. But it is also personal because I cannot separate myself from my gender, I cannot separate myself of how I was born, so their hatred of non-White people, their hatred of women is a hatred of me.""",2
7," (CNN)A child has died after a man allegedly rammed his SUV through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, bringing the death toll to six, according to prosecutors Tuesday.The child was one of 16 children admitted to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, facility officials said in a news release.""With deepest sympathy and sorrow, Children's Wisconsin shares that earlier Tuesday, a child being cared for at Children's Wisconsin passed away from injuries sustained at the Waukesha parade. As family and friends learn of this loss and the name of the child is likely to become public, the child's parents have asked that their privacy be respected. They do not wish to be contacted by media at this time,"" the release said.Two children were able to go home Monday, the release said. A total of 13 children remain hospitalized, with six in critical condition three in fair condition and four in good condition, the release said.The latest death comes as Darrell E. Brooks, 39, was officially charged Tuesday with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, according to the Waukesha County District Attorney's Office. Prosecutors said they will consider a sixth homicide charge, due to the child's death.Brooks made his first court appearance to face charges Tuesday. The judge set his bail at $5 million. Brooks was arrested Sunday after police said he barreled into the Waukesha Christmas parade Sunday. Along with the six deaths, a total of 62 injured, according to charging documents. At least 18 children were also included in the number of people injured. If convicted, Brooks faces life in prison for all five charges, the charging document states. Brooks' bail was set at $5 million because the judge said he believed Brooks was a flight risk. While police said they don't believe the tragedy was an act of terrorism, new questions have emerged. LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the deadly Wisconsin paradeThe motive remains a mysteryBrooks was involved in a domestic disturbance with another person just before plowing his SUV through the parade, Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said.He said police weren't able to respond to the domestic disturbance call because reports from the parade tragedy came flooding in shortly afterward.Early indications were that Brooks was fleeing the initial incident, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the preliminary investigation findings. But there was no police chase of Brooks leading up to the parade, Thompson said. He said the motive for why he crashed into the crowd remains unclear.According to a criminal complaint describing the incident, three different officers with the Waukesha Police Department attempted to stop Brooks as he was driving. The first officer, identified in the complaint as Detective Casey, saw people jumping out of the way of the red Ford Escape. Casey stepped in front of the SUV, the complaint reads, and yelled at the driver to stop multiple times. At this point, the vehicle had been going ""at a slow speed,"" brushed Casey as he stepped to the driver's side door continuously yelling and continued toward the parade at a faster rate of speed.Further down the road, Officer Butryn saw the SUV and yelled at the driver to stop multiple times. Butryn estimated the vehicle was going about 25 mph, the complaint said. ""Officer Butryn observed the driver looking straight ahead, directly at him, and it appeared he had no emotion on his face,"" the complaint said. The SUV passed Butryn, at which point he saw the vehicle increase in speed until it reached an intersection where it appeared to stop, the complaint said. ""The vehicle then appeared to rapidly accelerate, as Officer Butryn heard tires squeal,"" the complaint read. ""At this point, it was clear to Officer Butryn that this was an intentional act to strike and hurt as many people as possible.""Butryn saw the vehicle driving in a zig-zag-like pattern, the complaint said. ""It was like the SUV was trying to avoid vehicles, not people. There was no attempt made by the vehicle to stop, much less slow down,"" one witness told an officer, according to the complaint. Butryn also saw ""bodies and objects"" flying as the vehicle drove through and he continued running after it. Officer Scholten saw the vehicle plowing through crowds as well, and shot at the vehicle three times. Both Casey and Butryn saw multiple fatalities and injuries, the complaint said. Casey saw three of the victims die at the scene. The other two were taken to local hospitals where they died, the complaint said. Doctors from the Waukesha County Medical Examiner's Office concluded the victims' cause of death to be ""multiple blunt force injuries,"" the complaint said.The suspect was out on bond for a questionable amountBrooks was released from jail less than two weeks ago after allegedly using a vehicle to run over a woman who said she was the mother of his child, court documents show.The woman survived the November 2 incident and was taken to a hospital for her injuries, according to a criminal complaint.Prosecutors filed five charges related to the incident, including obstructing an officer, second-degree recklessly endangering safety with domestic abuse assessments, disorderly conduct with domestic abuse assessments and misdemeanor battery with domestic abuse assessments.Brooks was released from jail November 11 on $1,000 bail -- an amount the Milwaukee County district attorney's office had recommended but now questions.""The State's bail recommendation in this case was inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges and the pending charges against Mr. Brooks,"" the office said in a statement Monday. ""The bail recommendation in this case is not consistent with the approach of the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office toward matters involving violent crime, nor was it consistent with the risk assessment of the defendant prior to setting of bail,"" the DA's office said.""This office is currently conducting an internal review of the decision to make the recent bail recommendation in this matter in order to determine the appropriate next steps.""Brooks was also charged with bail jumping because he was already out on bail following a July 2020 incident in which he was charged with two counts of second-degree reckless endangering safety with use of a dangerous weapon and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon, according to court documents.CNN reached out to Brooks' attorney from the 2020 and earlier November 2021 incident about the DA statement but has not yet received a response.The suspect is also a registered sex offenderQuestions about why Brooks was released on $1,000 bond came as news emerged about Brooks' criminal record in Nevada.Brooks pleaded guilty to statutory sexual seduction in November 2006, according to court and inmate records. Additional details about the case were not immediately available. CNN has been unable to identify Brooks' lawyer for this case.According to the inmate records, Brooks served his sentence in the Northern Nevada Correctional Center from March 2007 to September 2008.The Nevada sex offender registry shows Brooks is a registered sex offender in that state. Brooks also has an outstanding arrest warrant in Nevada in an unrelated case for which he was arrested and jumped bail, authorities said. The warrant was issued on August 15, 2016, for jumping bail, said Sarah Johns, Washoe County Sheriff's Office spokesperson. Johns said detectives later determined Brooks was in Wisconsin. ""However, detectives did not have viable intelligence on Brooks' exact location.""CNN has reached out to a previous attorney for Brooks, but has not received a response.Victims are still being treated at hospitalsWhile Waukesha mourns the five people killed during the parade, dozens of people are trying to recover from their injures.Authorities identified five of the six people killed as Virginia Sorenson, 79; LeAnna Owen, 71; Tamara Durand, 52; Jane Kulich, 52; and Wilhelm Hospel, 81.Another victim was identified Tuesday as Jackson Sparks, 8, according to the family's verified GoFundMe page. It is not immediately clear if Jackson Sparks is the sixth parade death mentioned by prosecutors and confirmed by Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.""This afternoon, our dear Jackson has sadly succumbed to his injuries and passed away,"" an update posted to the page said Tuesday.Sparks had undergone brain surgery Sunday evening, according to the GoFundMe page.Jackson's 12-year-old brother, Tucker, was also injured during the parade and was in the ICU at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, but according to the GoFundMe page, he was expected to be discharged Tuesday.Many of the other victims injured in the crash were transported to area hospitals, and some were still being treated as of Tuesday. A firefighter's son, who was marching with his high school band in the Parade, has just been moved out of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Intensive Care Unit, according to his father Don Tiegs. Erick Tiegs was struck by the SUV as it plowed through the parade, according to a news release by Caledonia Firefighters Association. ""He has undergone surgery to repair a broken femur. He is still being treated for other injuries, including placement of a chest drainage tube, and is continuing to be assessed for any further complications. Unfortunately, he has a long road to recovery ahead of him,"" the release said.Five dancers who were injured remain in the ICU, the Waukesha Xtreme Dance Team said in a statement on their Facebook page Tuesday.Eighteen children, ranging in ages 3 to 16, were transported to Children's Wisconsin Hospital, according to Dr. Amy Drendel, director of the hospital's emergency department and trauma center.",2
8," (CNN)Brian Laundrie died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head, an attorney for the Laundrie family told CNN Tuesday.""Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide,"" said attorney Steven Bertolino. CNN has reached out to authorities for further comment, and has followed up with Bertolino regarding how Laundrie came to be in possession of a gun.Laundrie's remains were found in a Florida nature reserve last month after a weekslong manhunt. He disappeared just days after his fiancée Gabby Petito was reported missing.The couple had been traveling across the country over the summer in a converted van and documenting their travels on social media. The case gained national attention as authorities searched for both.Laundrie returned to his parents' house in Florida on September 1 without Petito. As police were trying to question the family about Petito's whereabouts, Laundrie went missing on September 13 or 14 after leaving home with a backpack, according to his parents. Petito's remains were found in Wyoming on September 19. Her death was ruled a homicide by manual strangulation.Petito's family says they are ""aware of the circumstances"" regarding Laundrie. But they are not making an official comment at the request of the US Attorney's Office and the Teton County Prosecutor's Office in Wyoming, according to a statement from the family.The family was asked not to make any comments while the investigation into her death is ongoing, the statement said.A Florida medical examiner's office confirmed Tuesday Laundrie had died of suicide by a gunshot wound to the head.The office won't make the autopsy report public ""until the law enforcement investigation is complete,"" the office said in a release.A timeline of the Petito caseWhat led to Petito's death remains a mystery. The FBI had described Laundrie as a ""person of interest"" in her murder, but he was not charged. He had, though, been indicted for allegedly using two accounts that belonged to someone else in the days after she died. Laundrie's remains were found October 20 in an area of Carlton Reserve that had been underwater during previous searches of the 25,000-acre nature reserve in North Port. Laundrie's father, who was searching with authorities the day his son's remains were found, discovered a notebook near where Laundrie's body was found. Experts said at the time the notebook could be key in providing answers. The notebook was wet at the time, and officials haven't yet said whether they have gained any information from it. Bertolini said in October Laundrie's parents had discussed ""several times"" the possibility their son had died by suicide. ",2
9," (CNN Business)A jury in Ohio ruled Tuesday that three major pharmaceutical chains bore responsibility for the opioid epidemic in two Ohio counties.The civil case, brought in federal court against CVS (CVS), Walmart (WMT) and Walgreens, marks the first time pharmacies have been found responsible in the nationwide epidemic.""It is a precedent setting case,"" Mark Lanier, the lead trial attorney for Lake and Trumbull Counties, told CNN Tuesday.Damages are set to be adjudicated in the spring. Lanier said that each county would be seeking over $1 billion in damages. Together, the counties represent some 440,000 Ohioans, according to court documents.The suit, which was initially filed in 2018, was part of the federal multi-district litigation created that year to address the manifold claims against opioid manufacturers and distributors.The counties alleged that the pharmacies ""abused their position of special trust and responsibility"" as registered dispensers of controlled drugs, and in so doing ""fostered a black market for prescription opioids.""""Prescription opioid pill mills and rogue prescribers cannot channel opioids for illicit use without at least the tacit support and willful blindness of the Defendants, if not their knowing support,"" the complaint read.In statements to CNN on Tuesday, all three pharmaceutical chains indicated that they would appeal the verdict.""We are disappointed with the outcome of this trial. The facts and the law do not support the verdict. We believe the trial court committed significant legal errors in allowing the case to go before a jury on a flawed legal theory that is inconsistent with Ohio law,"" Fraser Engerman, a Walgreens spokesperson, told CNN.""As we have said throughout this process, we never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the 'pill mills' and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis,"" Engerman added.In a statement, Walmart criticized the trial as ""riddled with remarkable legal and factual mistakes.""""Plaintiffs' attorneys sued Walmart in search of deep pockets while ignoring the real causes of the opioid crisis—such as pill mill doctors, illegal drugs, and regulators asleep at the switch—and they wrongly claimed pharmacists must second-guess doctors in a way the law never intended and many federal and state health regulators say interferes with the doctor-patient relationship,"" Walmart's statement read, in part. ""As a pharmacy industry leader in the fight against the opioid crisis, Walmart is proud of our pharmacists, who are dedicated to helping patients in the face of a tangled web of conflicting federal and state opioid guidelines.""CVS similarly defended its pharmacists in a statement.""We strongly disagree with the decision,"" CVS spokesperson Mike DeAngelis said. ""Pharmacists fill legal prescriptions written by DEA-licensed doctors who prescribe legal, FDA-approved substances to treat actual patients in need."" ""We're proud of the substantial work we've done to support our pharmacists in detecting illegitimate prescribing,"" he continued. ""But the simple facts are that opioid prescriptions are written by doctors, not pharmacists; opioid medications are made and marketed by manufacturers, not pharmacists; and our health care system depends on pharmacists to fill legitimate prescriptions that doctors deem necessary for their patients.""Counties reactThe verdict was happy news to officials in Lake and Trumbull counties, where damages are expected to fund opioid abatement measures.""Today's verdict means a lot to Lake County, because it is a substantive step forward to real healing in this epidemic,"" Lake County Commissioner John Plecnik told CNN.  ""On behalf of all Lake County families, we thank the jury for sending a powerful message to rebuke those responsible for overselling opioids."" ""This verdict will also mean greater resources to combat opioid addiction, which are desperately needed,"" Plecnik said. ""I can't say this strongly enough, no one is immune to the impact of addiction and opioid abuse, and this is not just a victory for Lake and Trumbull, it is a victory for all Americans.""""Truly, in Lake County, we have not had a corner of the county that has not been impacted by this epidemic,"" Kim Frasier, head of Lake County's department of Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services, said in a Tuesday afternoon press conference. ""This verdict gives voice to those individuals and those families who have been so traumatized.""April Caraway, head of Trumbull County's Mental Health and Recovery Board, echoed the sentiment.""We appreciate some vindication,"" she said. ""This was difficult, but we wanted to do it for the people who've lost people.""Next stepsLanier told CNN that attorneys for both sides are still scheduling the damages phase, where Judge Dan Polster will put a dollar figure to the damages suffered by Lake and Trumbull counties. In the meantime, an appeal is expected in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.",2
10," (CNN)It's the absolute worst-kept secret in politics: Donald Trump is full-speed-ahead on a 2024 presidential bid.The latest evidence came Tuesday when Politico reported on polling conducted in five swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- pitting the former President against current President Joe Biden.The polling was paid for by the Trump super PAC ""Make America Great Again, Again!"" which is the real name for the organization. CNN does not typically report partisan polls as they are paid for by, well, partisan candidates.The data, according to Politico, showed Trump ahead of Biden in each of the states by margins ranging from 3 points (Georgia) to 12 points (Michigan).The numbers, while clearly encouraging for Trump, are less important than the fact the polling is being conducted at all.What surveys in those five swing states are clearly meant to make clear -- to anyone and everyone considering a run for the 2024 GOP nomination: Trump is the prohibitive favorite in any such race.""Poll after poll clearly demonstrates that former President Donald Trump is still the 800-pound gorilla in the GOP and would be its 2024 nominee should he run,"" Tony Fabrizio, who conducted the polls, told Politico. ""This new data clearly shows that today the voters in these five key states would be happy to return Trump to the White House and send Biden packing.""Much of what Trump and his allies are doing at the moment, with the 2024 election nearly three years away, is trying to keep the field clear for the former President. They know that ambitious politicians -- Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri to name two -- are circling the 2024 contest. And the Trumpists want this message sent to those pols as loudly and clearly as possible: This is Trump's race to run, not yours.The Point: Polling done almost three years before an election -- and with a midterm election sandwiched in between -- should be taken with considerable caveats. But that Trump's super PAC is doing the polling tells you everything you need to know about the former President's plans and interests.",2
11,"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN)The prosecutor in the trial of three men accused of killing Ahmaud Arbery sought Tuesday to simplify the events that led to the 25-year-old's death, taking the podium the day after defense teams spent closing arguments trying to criminalize Arbery, alleging he brought his death on himself. Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski delivered her rebuttal early Tuesday, emphasizing to the jury Arbery was accused of no crime and the defendants told police they knew of no crime he'd committed. She had almost two hours remaining after delivering the first part of her closing arguments ahead of defense counsel. Live updates: Follow the trialLawyers for the three White men charged with murder used their final statements Monday to say Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and William ""Roddie"" Bryan Jr. had reason to believe Arbery was up to no good because he'd entered an under-construction home and he ran when confronted. Laura Hogue, one of Gregory McMichael's attorneys, referred to Arbery as a ""recurring nighttime intruder"" and implied he had nefarious intent when he arrived ""in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails."" Dunikoski seized on the defense notion that the McMichaels were scared -- and their Glynn County, Georgia' s Satilla Shores neighborhood had been living in fear -- because of crime in the area. That the armed men decided to chase Arbery for five minutes in their trucks is evidence alone they weren't frightened, she said. They had alternatives -- including never chasing Arbery or calling police -- but instead they chose to pursue Arbery even after he repeatedly eluded them, said Dunikoski. They committed aggravated assault with their trucks -- and the McMichaels, with their guns -- while trying to falsely imprison Arbery, she said. During the course of these felonies, Dunikoski said, they killed Arbery. ""If you take that out would he be alive?"" she asked the jury. ""It's real simple. The answer is you can't take out any of these crimes. If you take out any one of these crimes that they committed and he's still alive. All of the underlying felonies played a substantial and necessary part in causing the death of Ahmaud Arbery.""Claims that they were protecting their neighborhood appear spurious, Dunikoski said, when you consider  the property owner never accused Arbery of any crime -- aside from entering the property without incident -- and nothing had been stolen there in the months prior to Arbery's fatal shooting. Dunikoski has also said the defendants can't claim self-defense when Arbery, unarmed and on foot, tried for five minutes to elude three men, two of them armed, chasing him in a pair of pickup trucks. She asked the jury: Why, if this was about stopping crime, did the McMichaels never mention a specific crime or citizen's arrest to the police at the scene?Following Dunikoski's rebuttal, Judge Timothy Walmsley gave jurors instructions and said, for Bryan, he'd permit them to consider simple assault, reckless conduct or reckless driving in lieu of aggravated assault with a truck. The jury, composed of nine White women, two White men and a Black man (with two White women and a White man as alternates), began deliberating shortly thereafter. The jury spent more than six hours deliberating on day one. Walmsley checked in on jurors twice to see if a verdict was imminent, with the foreperson reporting they had not returned one. The jury told the judge they considered continuing deliberations into the evening, but ultimately decided to break. Court adjourned around 6:30 p.m. ET and day two of deliberations will begin Wednesday at 8 a.m.Judge denies motion for mistrialDefense lawyers made remarks Monday that legal experts felt were racially insensitive, and Dunikoski has insisted the defendants targeted Arbery ""because he was a Black man running down the street.""Travis McMichael testified he never saw Arbery armed, never heard Arbery threaten him and Arbery showed no interest in conversing with McMichael.The men acted on ""assumptions and driveway decisions,"" Dunikoski has said, and they had no immediate knowledge Arbery committed a crime, a key factor in claiming citizen's arrest. The defense moved for a mistrial, saying Dunkioski's misstated the state's now-defunct citizen's arrest law. Walmsley denied the motion.Along with his father, Gregory McMichael, and Bryan, his neighbor, Travis McMichael faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony in the February 23, 2020, killing. The trio say they pursued Arbery only after suspecting him of burglary.Travis McMichael testified he shot Arbery in self-defense after Arbery grabbed his gun. He told Dunikoski he was ""scattered"" and traumatized when he initially told police he didn't know if Arbery grabbed the shotgun. The men have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they face maximum sentences of life in prison without parole. Family objects to comments from defense attorneyOn Monday, Hogue claimed Arbery repeatedly trespassed -- and perhaps more -- when entering a construction site in the neighborhood outside Brunswick. ""Turning Ahmaud Arbery into a victim after the choices that he made does not reflect the reality of what brought Ahmaud Arbery to Satilla Shores in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails,"" Hogue said.Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, almost tripped leaving the courtroom, saying, ""I gotta get out of here.""Arbery was never charged with any crimes in the neighborhood. The owner of the property never said Arbery committed a crime, just that he was caught on camera at the site. Race has been a key focus. Arbery is Black, and 11 of the 12 jurors are White. Ben Crump, an attorney for Arbery's father, suggested race played a factor in the killing.""They had dozens of other people who visited the home. Nobody chased them. Nobody said that they burglarized the home. Why is that?"" Crump asked Monday.It was a point important to Dunikoski's rebuttal. Arbery had been to the under-construction property multiple times, she said, but he never stole anything. Responding to defense implications Arbery could've been responsible for items stolen from a boat in 2019, Dunikoski noted property owner Larry English told police he had no idea who stole the items, the items may have been stolen at another location and he suspected subcontractors might be responsible. Video from December 2020, showing Arbery inside the home looking around and nothing more, also appears to provide counterpoint to the argument Arbery was never known to jog in Satilla Shores. In the video, Arbery exits the home empty-handed toward the street and breaks into a jog, disappearing from view as he runs down Satilla Drive. ""What's Mr. Arbery doing? More importantly, what's Mr. Arbery not doing?"" she asked the jury in reference to the video. If Arbery committed a crime, Dunikoski said, it was criminal trespass, or maybe prowling or loitering, all misdemeanors -- none meeting the prerequisite for citizen's arrest. The McMichaels told police they didn't know if Arbery had been in English's house, she reminded jurors. ""If the (McMichaels and Bryan) were not conducting a lawful citizen's arrest, you do not have to consider ... self-defense because if it's not a lawful citizen's arrest -- that they were the first unjustified aggressors and they were committing felonies against Mr. Arbery, and therefore they don't get to claim self-defense.""During jury instructions, Walmsley told jurors in a citizen's arrest, the person making the arrest must have witnessed the crime with her or his own senses or the perpetrator must've admitted a crime. It is not legal to make a citizen's arrest based on ""unsupported statements of others alone,"" and the person making the arrest -- either after the crime, or in the case of a felony, during an escape -- must exact the arrest immediately, the judge said. Lawyers: Defendants just protecting neighborhood""Travis McMichael spent almost a decade of his life learning about duty and responsibility,"" his attorney Jason Sheffield said Monday, referring to McMichael's time in the US Coast Guard. ""He received extensive training on how to make a decision that will ultimately impact his beliefs."" Dunikoski countered Travis McMichael didn't follow his training and couldn't have been adhering to de-escalation techniques when he chased Arbery -- his armed father cursing at Arbery from his truck bed -- and then exited his truck with a shotgun. In closing, Sheffield reiterated the feelings of neighbors who testified they were afraid because of incidents in the neighborhood, including burglaries. Travis McMichael felt a ""responsibility"" to help protect the neighborhood, Sheffield said. ""These are real experiences with real people who were very scared, and so they took it upon themselves to do something about it -- got cameras, called the police, notify each other, citizens' watch, neighborhood watch,"" he said.   Hogue told the jury they needed only to consider two questions.""Did Greg McMichael have reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion to believe that Ahmaud Arbery had committed a burglary ... and did he have reasonable and probable grounds to believe that Ahmaud Arbery was escaping or attempting to escape yet again?"" she said.Attorney Kevin Gough, who represents Bryan, described his client as a witness, arguing jurors should consider Bryan was the one who filmed the chase and killing, changing the course of the investigation. ""He did not know and could not know that Arbery would be shot. By that time, sadly, there was nothing that Roddie Bryan could do to prevent this tragedy. He didn't shoot anyone. At the time of the shooting, he was some distance back. He was armed only with his cell phone,"" Gough said.""Ladies and gentlemen, without Roddie Bryan, there is no case,"" he said.In her closing, Dunikoski emphasized everyone is responsible. Because all three men committed felonies before Travis McMichael shot Arbery, they are parties to the crime, she said. ""Under the law in Georgia, it's as if they were all holding the gun together,"" she said. ",2
12," (CNN)Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik is demanding an apology from the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, but does intend to comply with a subpoena he has received from the panel, according to his lawyer.Kerik worked alongside his longtime friend Rudy Giuliani, a former attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the weeks after the presidential election to find any evidence of voter fraud that would swing it for Trump. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.In a Tuesday letter to select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, Kerik's lawyer Timothy Parlatore asked for additional time to comply with the panel's requests so that they can go through requested materials and sort out any potential privilege claims with attorneys for the former President.The committee subpoenaed Kerik earlier this month, in part, because it alleged he had attended a meeting at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, on January 5 in which Giuliani; former Trump adviser Steve Bannon; John Eastman, an attorney who worked with Trump's legal team; and others discussed options for overturning the election results -- such as pressuring then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the Electoral College results, among other things.Parlatore wrote to Thompson that ""Mr. Kerik never attended any such meeting.""""If you were not personally responsible for this fabrication and false statements, then someone on your staff was and should be held accountable,"" he wrote.Kerik previously confirmed to CNN that he paid for rooms and suites in Washington, DC, hotels that ""served as election-related command centers,"" according to the committee.In February, Make America Great Again PAC, the successor organization to the Trump presidential campaign, made two large disbursements for ""recount travel expenses,"" according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. The PAC paid Kerik's company and Giuliani's company $66,251.54 and $76,566.95, respectively.The Tuesday letter also outlined Kerik's complaints about a press release issued by the committee along with the subpoena, insisting the committee should not have claimed that Kerik worked with Giuliani to ""promote baseless litigation"" without reviewing the evidence Kerik had gathered.The former police commissioner is demanding that the press release and subpoena cover letter be withdrawn or corrected and an apology be issued, according to his lawyer.But ""notwithstanding the significant issues"" with the committee's public statements, ""Mr. Kerik still intends to comply with the subpoena,"" the Tuesday letter stated.",2
13," (CNN)An Atlanta-area man accused of stabbing a police officer during an attempted burglary last week has also been charged with murder in connection with the deaths of a firefighter and his wife, officials say.Matthew Scott Lanz, 22, was arrested Friday in Sandy Springs, Georgia, after allegedly stabbing a police officer, who was responding to a burglary in progress, according to a news release from the Sandy Springs Police Department (SSPD.) Officers discovered Lanz inside the residence when they arrived and a confrontation ensued, the release said. Officers unsuccessfully attempted to subdue Lanz by using a Taser on him, it said, and that's when Lanz repeatedly stabbed one of the responding officers.""A back-up officer who witnessed the attack, shot the suspect in an attempt to stop the stabbing. The injured Officer was rushed to a local hospital where he received treatment for his multiple wounds,"" the release reads. The injured officer was later released from the hospital, according to an update tweeted by SSPD Saturday.Lanz was also sent to an area hospital following the shooting, officials said.Lanz had no connection to the neighborhood where the burglary took place and did not know the homeowners, police said.According to SSPD, Lanz is the brother of Austin William Lanz, the man who the FBI said fatally stabbed a Pentagon police officer on August 3, before taking his own life with the officer's service weapon. Couple killed in their homeLanz was later identified as the suspect in the murder of a husband and wife on Thursday in Acworth, where he lives, according to a press release from the Cobb County Police Department. Acworth is about 25 miles northwest of Sandy Springs. Cobb County Police identified the victims as Timothy Justin Hicks, 31, and his wife Amber Hicks, 31. The fire department in nearby Cherokee County confirmed on its Facebook page that Hicks had been a firefighter with the department for more than six years. The couple was found dead in their home from gunshot wounds. Cobb County police said a 2-year-old was also in the home but was unharmed. Investigators said in the release that the incident appeared to have happened overnight, but they did not give a specific timeline.  Lanz faces two counts of felony murder and multiple other charges, including home invasion, aggravated assault, weapons possession, and attempted murder in connection with the two incidents, according to SSPD. In Cobb County, the release states he is being charged with two counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, home invasion, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.CNN has reached out to Lanz's court-appointed attorney for comment but has not heard back. Lanz was transferred to Fulton County Jail after he was released from the hospital, both SSPD and Cobb County said in their releases. He is still in custody, according to jail records. Court records show he made his first court appearance Friday. His next court date has not been posted yet. ",2
14," (CNN)The next presidential election is three years away. Recent reports about early concern over whether President Joe Biden will run for reelection in 2024 and about tension between potential 2024 rivals, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Vice President Kamala Harris are, to some extent, standard Washington gossip that can be safely ignored. Still, there may be something more than that.  Buttigieg is clearly very ambitious, ran an impressive presidential campaign in 2020 and has only strengthened his political skills since then. Harris, as the vice president, is a leading contender to be the face of the post-Joe Biden Democratic Party. Each may see the other as standing in their way as 2024 approaches. This is particularly important because the 79-year-old Biden, despite wisely sending signals that he will seek reelection in 2024, may decide that he doesn't want to run three years from now.If Biden does run, as an incumbent, he has an advantage. But if he chooses not to, that doesn't mean Democrats are doomed.A primary campaign between Harris and Buttigieg could pit two key Democratic constituencies against each other: African Americans, particularly African American women, and LGBTQ voters. The impact of that fight would be even worse if it began in 2023 and took over the second half of Biden's current term. Fortunately, this is a problem that can be easily solved without either politician having to give up anything lasting. Harris and Buttigieg instead could agree that, if Biden does not run again, they would run together in 2024, with Harris the nominee for president and Buttigieg for vice-president. This could put an end to whatever feuding exists between them now, while giving the Democratic Party a very strong ticket in 2024 that would seem like a natural continuation of Biden's first term. A Harris-Buttigieg ticket would showcase two dynamic politicians and represent the breadth and diversity of the Democratic Party, and indeed the whole country, while not veering too far left and alienating key swing voters who Biden won in 2020.This ticket would be balanced with regards to geography: Harris is unmistakably Californian while Buttigieg is from Indiana, and brings with him a deep understanding of the Midwest.  Harris would be 60 years old on Election Day 2024, while Buttigieg would be 42, so there would be generational balance there as well. Both nominees represent important Democratic Party constituencies -- Harris is an African American and Asian American woman, while Buttigieg is a gay man. This would help mobilize important parts of the Democratic base. However, both politicians are essentially moderates, so it would be hard for the Republican Party to effectively tar them as radicals, socialists or anything like that -- something they would undoubtedly try to do. During, and since, the 2020 election, the right wing has tried to paint Harris as being on the far left, but that attack never got much traction.A Harris-Buttigieg ticket would also have a fair amount of star power. Although Harris did very poorly when she ran for president in 2020, we have seen glimpses of what she can be,  including the first presidential debate of the primary season when she landed some very effective attacks on Biden. Later, during the vice-presidential debate, she more than held her own against a very polished Mike Pence. It's also visible in the easy and strong rapport she has with many voters. Buttigieg has shined in recent months, as well during the 2020 general election, due to his media skills, fast wit and sharp intellect.Not every faction of the Democratic coalition would be happy with this ticket. The left wing of the party has long viewed Buttigieg as too moderate and have been wary of Harris due to her work as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney general. These concerns are legitimate, but by the time they have served four years in the Biden's administration, what Harris did as DA almost 20 years earlier or as attorney general a decade ago will seem less relevant. Rather, the two will be seen as national leaders whose popularity will be tied to the Biden administration rather than anything they did before that. By taking the second spot on the ticket, Buttigieg would be putting his own presidential aspirations on hold, but he is so young that he would still have plenty of opportunities to run for president. One way to see this is that if Harris and Buttigieg ticket got elected in 2024 and reelected in 2028, Buttigieg would still be only 50 if he chose to run in 2032. Harris-Buttigieg could turn out to be a dream ticket for the Democrats while simultaneously avoiding a potentially damaging dynamic both within the administration and in a possible Democratic primary. However, a lot must happen between now and then to make it a reality. In addition to getting buy-in from both people directly involved, it is also important to avoid the appearance that a backroom deal is being made. This is something to which the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is particularly sensitive. The way to do this is to tamp down any speculation about a deal while at the same time bolstering Harris and making it clear to Buttigieg that the administration is not going to abandon the vice president in the face of media criticism. When Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, he indicated that she was the future of the Democratic Party. It is natural that other politicians who see themselves as that future might chafe at that. Nonetheless, regardless of how she is viewed by many now, Harris will be a strong frontrunner to succeed Biden. The best way to ensure victory for the party may not be a drawn-out effort to nominate another flawed candidate, but to put together a balanced ticket with two rising Democratic Party stars. ",2
15," (CNN)Senate candidate Sean Parnell's abrupt end to his campaign in Pennsylvania has shaken up the Republican primary field in a crucial race as the party seeks to win a majority next fall.According to multiple Republican operatives in and outside of the Keystone State, the slate of GOP candidates could expand in coming weeks to include hedge fund executive David McCormick and daytime TV personality Dr. Mehmet Oz. ""Right now you've got a wide-open, fluid field in Pennsylvania,"" said Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and a CNN contributor.Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection, and Democrats see the seat as one of their top pickup opportunities heading into the 2022 midterms. Without Parnell as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, Republicans are hoping to defend a seat held by a member of their party for all but two of the last 52 years.McCormick, a former official in the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, is a Pennsylvania native and West Point graduate. For years he has lived in Connecticut, where his hedge fund is located, but Republicans in Pennsylvania have been trying to recruit McCormick to come back to the state.""There has been an accelerated outreach from Republican leaders, both within Pennsylvania and nationally, as well as donors, for Dave to come into the race,"" said one person close to McCormick. ""The Parnell departure has clearly created an opening where he's seriously considering it.""Pennsylvania Republicans are more perplexed that Oz, an Ohio-born doctor who attended medical school in Philadelphia and lives in New Jersey, is considering a run. Oz's interest in this race was first reported in the Washington Free Beacon and Politico, but the host of the Dr. Oz Show said in a 2007 interview that he would ""consider"" running for office some day, calling himself a ""moderate Republican.""Representatives of Oz did not respond to CNN's inquiries about his plans, but Republicans acknowledge that his celebrity could be a significant factor in a wide-open race.""This crowd is so big and unknown,"" said one GOP operative.Parnell's departure and the possible entrance of new candidates in the primary, which already includes Carla Sands and Jeff Bartos, has given Republicans a second chance to set their field after weeks of concerning developments with Parnell's candidacy after former President Donald Trump backed him.An Army combat veteran and former House candidate, Parnell had faced increased scrutiny of his personal life amid ongoing divorce and custody fights. Allegations against Parnell from his estranged wife, Laurie Snell, had raised concerns among some Republicans about his viability as a candidate. Snell had accused Parnell of being physically abusive toward her and injuring their children on two occasions, claims that Parnell has denied.But on Monday, a Pennsylvania judge awarded Snell full legal custody and primary physical custody of their three children. The judge also determined that Parnell committed some abusive acts toward his wife in the past.""There is nothing more important to me than my children, and while I plan to ask the court to reconsider, I can't continue with a Senate campaign,"" Parnell said in a statement.Parnell spoke with Trump on Monday to inform him of his plans, according to Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich. It's unclear whether the former President will back another person in the primary, though he has connections to multiple current and potential candidates.Sands, a Pennsylvania-born Republican fundraiser, served under Trump as ambassador to Denmark, while McCormick's wife is Dina Powell, who served as a national security official in Trump's White House and remains close to Trump's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.And in 2018, Trump appointed Oz to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. (Another Trump appointee to the council, Herschel Walker, is running for the Republican Senate nomination in Georgia and has Trump's endorsement.)""I could see Trump sitting it out if both get in,"" said one Republican operative close to the former President, referring to McCormick and Oz. ""Or Oz doesn't run, and Trump just goes all-in for Dave.""Democrats in Pennsylvania also have a competitive primary, with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Rep. Conor Lamb among those vying for the nomination. Republicans in the state say the primary could pull the eventual Democratic nominee too far to the left in the swing state where winning suburban swing voters is the key to victory.With the expected nationwide edge for Republicans in next year's midterm elections across the country, Dent says the best thing Trump could do in the Keystone State is stay away from the GOP primary.""Republicans have clear advantages going into the 2022 midterm, they just have to not blow it. And not blowing it requires former President Trump to behave constructively,"" Dent said. ""That would actually be constructive, to stay out of the primary.""",2
16," (CNN Business)Apple on Tuesday sued NSO Group and its parent company, accusing the Israeli firm of violating a federal anti-hacking law by selling potent software that clients have used to spy on Apple customers. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, alleges that NSO's spyware, known as Pegasus, and other malware have caused Apple monetary and property damages, and violated the human rights of Apple users along the way. ""To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,"" Apple said in a statement. In a statement Tuesday, NSO Group did not address the specifics of the lawsuit and instead said the firm's technology saves lives.NSO Group provides ""lawful tools"" to help governments fight pedophiles and terrorists, the firm said.While NSO Group has long maintained that it only sells its software to authorized users for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes, researchers have for years uncovered evidence that Pegasus has been used to surveil dissidents and human rights activists. Researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September said that an unidentified party was using Pegasus, and a vulnerability in Apple operating software, to spy on a Saudi activist. The lawsuit is the latest setback for NSO Group, which cybersecurity analysts and human rights activists have long accused of doing business with repressive governments. The firm's easy-to-use spyware is capable of eavesdropping on a phone's communications and accessing other sensitive data on the device, according to researchers. The US Commerce Department this month added NSO Group to its so-called ""entity list,"" effectively banning the company from buying software components from US vendors without a license. Commerce accused NSO Group, and another Israeli firm known as Candiru, of providing spyware to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target"" journalists, embassy workers and activists.In a statement at the time, NSO Group said it was ""dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed.""""We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world's most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based [on] the American values we deeply share,"" according to the statement, ""which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts [sic] with government agencies that misused our products.""Candiru could not be reached for comment at the time.Apple is at least the second major US tech firm to sue NSO Group. Facebook (now known as Meta) in 2019 sued NSO Group for allegedly facilitating the breach of 1,400 phones running the WhatsApp messaging application. NSO Group has denied the allegations made by Facebook, and tried to block the case from moving forward. But a US appeals court this month ruled that the lawsuit could proceed.Apple said it would contribute $10 million, plus any damages from the lawsuit, to ""organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.""The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages from NSO Group, as well as ""compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.""NSO Group is just one of several firms that sell specialized hacking tools to break into different types of mobile phones.  In its lawsuit, Apple's lawyers reflected on what it called a ""continual arms race"" between Apple engineers and NSO Group's code-writers.""Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades,"" the complaint states.",2
17," (CNN)Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers returned to winning ways on Monday Night Football, beating the New York Giants 30-10 at Raymond James Stadium. Brady threw 307 passing yards and two touchdowns as the Bucs ended their two-game losing streak on Monday night, continuing the Giants' season of struggles. The 44-year-old also avoided losing three in a row for the first time since 2002. It was the 104th time in Brady's career that he's finished with over 300 passing yards. Only Drew Brees with 123 has more such games in NFL history.After the Tampa Bay's disappointing Week 10 loss to the Washington Football Team, Brady cut a frustrated character in his postgame press conference. However, on Monday night, the veteran quarterback looked much more content. ""We played better,"" a smiling Brady said. ""Better for all of us when we play better.""He added: ""We're at a decent point, but we can play a lot better than we've played. Hoping our best football is ahead of us.""A 300-pound record-breaking eveningAfter two underwhelming performances, Monday night started much better for the Bucs. Brady connected with Chris Godwin for a 13-yard touchdown in the first quarter to give the home team the lead early on. However, the former New England Patriots quarterback's second quarter intercepted pass allowed New York to draw level. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones threw a touchdown to offensive lineman Andrew Thomas to tie the score at 10-10, but the Bucs turned the screw from there. Brady was almost flawless for the rest of the game, and the Tampa Bay defense stymied the Giants' offense.Jones was sacked twice and threw two interceptions to Steve McLendon and Mike Edwards while Ronald Jones ran in the third of Tampa Bay's touchdowns.For the first time in NFL history, a 300-pound player had a touchdown (Thomas) and a 300-pound player had an interception (McLendon) in the same game.It was a particularly momentous game for Bucs wide receiver Mike Evans, who -- when he caught a five-yard TD pass from Brady -- entered himself into the team's history books. It was Evans' 72nd touchdown for the franchise, breaking the previous record for the most Bucs touchdowns of 71 set by Mike Alstott. Evans can add the record to his ever-growing resume of Tampa Bay all-time records. He already holds Bucs franchise records for receptions, receiving yards, touchdown catches and 100-yard receiving games. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosHe also has the single-season records for receiving yards and touchdown catches and is tied for the most overall touchdowns in a single season.He's now got 10 touchdowns on the year, the fourth time in eight NFL seasons he's reached double digits in that category. ""He's amazing in every way, as a player, teammate, friend, leader,"" said Brady of Evans. ""I love being out there with him, I love playing with him. He really sets the tone for that group. He had a great night.""",2
18," (CNN)Dean McDermott didn't make his family's holiday card photo shoot.His wife, actress Tori Spelling, shared the card on her Instagram Monday and explained why.The photo showed her and the couple's five children.""It's that time again,"" the caption on the photo began. ""And it's a winter wonderland at my house!""It was noted in the comments that her husband was absent, further fueling reported speculation that the pair have hit a rough patch in their marriage, which was amplified in June when she shared during a SiriusXM interview that they were sleeping in separate beds.

19," (CNN)Mammoths are long to be known as ancient land dwellers, so scientists were shocked to find remains from the animal at the bottom of the ocean. Pilot Randy Prickett and scientist Steven Haddock, researchers with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), discovered a Columbian mammoth tusk 185 miles offshore and 10,000 feet deep in the ocean in 2019, the institution said in a news release.At the time they were only able to collect a small piece of the tusk, so they returned in July 2021 to get the complete sample. ""You start to 'expect the unexpected' when exploring the deep sea, but I'm still stunned that we came upon the ancient tusk of a mammoth,"" said Haddock. ""Our work examining this exciting discovery is just beginning and we look forward to sharing more information in the future.""University of Michigan paleontologist Daniel Fisher, who specializes in the study of mammoths and mastodons, said it is unlike anything he has ever seen. ""Other mammoths have been retrieved from the ocean, but generally not from depths of more than a few tens of meters,"" Fisher said. A variety of research facilities are examining the tusk to determine a variety of information about it including the age of the animal at its death, the release said. The researchers said the cold, high pressure environment helped to preserve the tusk, so it can be studied in greater detail. The scientists believe it could be the oldest well-preserved mammoth tusk recovered from this region of North America, and the UCSC Geochronology Lab estimates it is more than 100,000 years old after analyzing the radioisotopes. Researchers hope the data collected can not only tell them more about the mammoth they found, but the species in general. ""Specimens like this present a rare opportunity to paint a picture both of an animal that used to be alive and of the environment in which it lived,"" said Beth Shapiro, lead researcher at the UCSC Paleogenomics Lab.""Mammoth remains from continental North America are particularly rare, and so we expect that DNA from this tusk will go far to refine what we know about mammoths in this part of the world.""",2
20,"Washington (CNN)Katherine Rickfelder, a Florida public school teacher, is one of nearly 30,000 people who have seen their student debt balance reduced to zero since the federal government announced significant changes to a popular loan forgiveness program last month.""I cried when I got the letter. I honestly feel like I can finally breathe again,"" said Rickfelder, who had another five years of payments to make under the old rules of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. She started paying off her student debt about 16 years ago.The letter, which she received from the US Department of Education in October, said that she would get credit for 91 additional monthly payments she had made on her student loans. That meant that she had already made more than the 120 payments required for debt forgiveness under the PSLF program, which is aimed at borrowers working in government and nonprofit sectors. ""I love teaching. But it has always been a financial struggle. Now I don't have to keep finding a workaround for the debt,"" Rickfelder, a single mom, said. Over the years, the money she borrowed for her undergraduate and master's degrees ballooned because her payments were barely covering the interest on the student loans. Her debt grew to more than $189,000.  Now, in addition to the cancellation of her remaining student loan debt, she also received a refund last week for the extra payments she had made. Eligibility for the PSLF program is temporarily expanded until October 31, 2022, so that it now includes borrowers who have older loans that didn't originally qualify as well as those who were in the wrong repayment plan but met the other requirements. More than 550,000 people are expected to see their debt wiped away sooner than expected due to the changes.Problems with the student loan forgiveness programThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007 and provides an incentive for workers to remain in lower-paying, public service jobs despite their student debt. Teachers, social workers and first responders can be eligible as well as doctors and lawyers -- if they were employed full time by a nonprofit or the government while making payments.After borrowers make 10 years of qualifying monthly payments, their remaining federal student debt is wiped away. But the program has long been criticized for being difficult to navigate, with borrowers receiving little help from their loan servicers, the companies that handle the billing. Many borrowers have said they found out they weren't eligible for forgiveness only after making what they thought were a decade's worth of qualifying payments.Prior to the recently announced changes, eligibility also hinged on having a Direct Loan and being enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan, which sets payments based on income and family size. Those with Federal Family Education Loans, which were made by private lenders but backed by the government, did not qualify. More than 80% of borrowers who have filed forms that did not meet the program's requirements had one of these loans.Borrowers are allowed to consolidate a Federal Family Education Loan into a Direct Loan to become eligible for the program, but none of their previous payments would count toward the required 120 -- until now.Many student loan borrowers are still waitingDue to the temporary waiver, it no longer matters what kind of federal student loan a borrower has or what payment plan he or she is enrolled in. All payments will be eligible for PSLF if the borrower was working full time for a qualifying employer.But many borrowers who newly qualify for debt forgiveness are still waiting to see their balance reduced. It's going to take time for the Department of Education to review all their accounts.""Please understand that complex changes of this magnitude are hard to process and execute,"" wrote Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray in a letter sent to borrowers earlier this month. ""We are working as quickly as possible to update your account and give you clear and accurate information. This may take several months,"" he added.The letter also acknowledged that some qualifying borrowers have received confusing information from their loan servicers and some have even been denied since the program overhaul was announced. Cordray pledged that those borrowers' accounts would be reviewed in the next few months. What student loan borrowers can do nextMany borrowers won't have to take any action in order to have the Department of Education review and update the number of their qualifying payments. But those with older Federal Family Education Loans will have to consolidate into a Direct Loan if they have not already done so. Those who already have Direct Loans but have not submitted an employment certification form for past periods of repayment must also do that now. Borrowers have until October 31, 2022, to make those changes to qualify for forgiveness under the temporary waiver. For those unsure if they qualify, the Department of Education updated its PSLF Help Tool earlier this week to reflect the new guidelines. The tool offers more details about next steps needed to take advantage of the waiver.",2

24," (CNN)Every retailer in the nation should take note of Target's bold announcement this week that it will never again open its stores on Thanksgiving.The company's chief executive, Brian Cornell, said he made the decision after employees told him they wanted to spend the holiday with their families -- which is, of course, exactly where they should be.The move to prioritize the well-being of Target's staffers sends a powerful message about the company's values at a time when Americans are rethinking our approaches to work. And, whether customers realize it or not, this benefits them, too. Other companies would be smart to follow suit.In September, 4.4 million Americans quit their jobs -- a jaw-dropping record that starkly indicates how the pandemic has prompted Americans to think more deeply about what they value most. The mass exodus, which many are calling the Great Resignation, reflects the country's newfound recognition that there is more to life than work (or overwork).Though being closed to customers doesn't necessarily mean some employees won't be working, Target's announcement still sends a strong public signal that the company is getting the message. The new policy is also shrewd. At a time when many employers are struggling to find and retain workers, it will likely give Target an edge in the hiring wars. Retail workers are traditionally overworked during the crush of consumer demand during the holiday season, and perhaps are even enticed to pick up extra shifts to pay for the holiday festivities of their own families. Of course, to do so means these workers have to sacrifice what they should be able to put above all else: Time with their loved ones, and rest and care for themselves. As a person whose spouse frequently has to work on major holidays, I can attest to the fact that it takes a real toll on a family not to be able to spend time together on important occasions. This year, my husband is off for Thanksgiving, but it's a tradeoff for other major holidays. He won't be around to put out cookies for Santa with our toddler on Christmas Eve, or to watch our baby open presents on her first Christmas morning. These are moments you don't ever get back.In my family, these sacrifices are worth it because my husband's work protects public health. As an emergency room doctor, when he's not with us he's often saving people's lives. The same goes for police officers, firefighters, EMS and other essential workers who we all rely on to keep us safe, even on special days -- and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude.But there's absolutely no excuse for nonessential employees to be forced to work on major holidays so that people can buy consumer goods.Americans who are desperate to shop on Thanksgiving can still do so online -- or they can buy their products in person before or after the national holiday. But Target's decision, in addition to sending a message to the business community, also carries a social meaning: it subtly encourages people to focus on the things that really matter, like the people in our lives, instead of consumer culture.That's also a very good thing for our country. Research shows that what makes us truly happy is close relationships with other people -- not the latest fashions or doorbuster bargains -- and that's exactly what we all should have the ability to seek on Thanksgiving.Ultimately, this policy stands to be good for Target's employees, its consumers and its bottom line. This decision burnishes the company's reputation as an organization that puts people before profits, and research consistently shows that consumers prefer to patronize companies that have a positive social impact. This is why other retailers and companies which don't absolutely have to be open on major holidays should quickly announce similar policies.      Thanksgiving is a time when we're all prompted to think about what really matters. It's refreshing to see a company do this, too. And if other companies follow Target's lead, prioritizing rest and personal time when it can mean the most, Americans will have something more to be grateful for this year.",2
25,"New York (CNN Business)Store workers at major US chains are getting to spend Thanksgiving at home as more retailers decide to close their doors for the holiday. But not all retail staff will get the day off.Target (TGT) said Monday that it will close all of its stores on Thanksgiving every year from now on, a move that may prompt rivals to follow suit — and make shopping in stores on Thanksgiving obsolete.In 2020, many other chains closed stores on Thanksgiving for the first time, including Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). These companies will again close stores on the holiday this year, although none have made permanent changes to their Thanksgiving policies going forward. Some companies, such as Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD), have closed stores on Thanksgiving for years.Home for ThanksgivingThat doesn't mean stores and warehouses will be completely empty Thursday. Black Friday is quickly approaching, and retailers need workers to prepare for the biggest shopping day of the year.A small percentage of Target's workforce, such as supply chain and service center workers, will still work on Thanksgiving, said a spokesperson for the company.Target said it worked with employees to understand their scheduling preference early in the season, and employees who work on Thanksgiving will receive extra pay. Most Target stores will reopen at 7 a.m. local time on Black Friday.Staying open on Thanksgiving had been a source of tension between retailers and labor advocates in the past, especially as many retailers opened their doors on the holiday to try to get a jump on Black Friday.Labor advocates have argued that workers should be at home with their families on Thanksgiving instead.Over the last several years, public pressure on retailers to close on Thanksgiving has faded. Workers' rights groups have instead focused on broader issues such as the minimum wage, benefits and schedules.Some states, including Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island, have prohibited big-box stores from opening on Thanksgiving. A California legislator proposed a law in 2016 that would have required some companies to pay employees double for working on Thanksgiving, but it did not pass.Why closing on Thanksgiving won't hurt retailersThe holiday period used to be marked by a few key days — Black Friday being the biggest. Stores would use the occasions to rack up most of their holiday sales. But with the growth of online shopping, retailers aren't as reliant on holidays to drive sales anymore.Retailers also don't want everyone buying at the same time. So, in recent years, they have started their deals and events earlier and spread them out across the season — helping avoid a crush of demand, which can strain their stores and delivery networks.This year, stores moved up their deals earlier than ever to get in front of supply chain snafus and limit empty shelves. The extended shopping season means that stores can close on Thanksgiving without much of an impact on sales.Staying open on Thanksgiving may not make much business sense either. Some retailers have found that keeping stores open on the holiday takes away from sales on Black Friday and over the long weekend.",2
26,"New York (CNN Business)Perhaps one of the greatest mysteries of Thanksgiving is the cranberry sauce — and we're not talking about why people eat it: Why are the labels on Ocean Spray cans upside down?Observant consumers have noticed that the labels on jellied cranberry sauce cans are flipped, meaning the rounded edge that's typically on the bottom of most canned goods is on top of Ocean Spray cranberry sauce cans. According to Ocean Spray, that's intentional: It creates a seamless serving experience. The cans are ""filled and labeled upside down with the rounded edge on top and the sharp can-like edge on the bottom to keep the jelly whole,"" an Ocean Spray spokesperson told CNN Business. That creates an air bubble on the rounded side (a.k.a. the top) so customers can ""can swipe the edge of the can with a knife to break the vacuum and the log will easily slide out.""This process has been in use since the early 2000s. Adweek, which recently reported this important can caveat, noted that about 67 million cans are sold between Thanksgiving and Christmas. But like other Thanksgiving meal staples, canned cranberry sauce might be hard to come by. The sauce has 79% availability across national retailers,  which is down from 89% in that same period, according to IRI, a market research firm that tracks US retail sales.Ocean Spray, a farmer co-operative that makes cranberry sauce and sells bagged cranberries, said that ""consumers may experience some availability issues at times on a variety of cranberry products,"" because of supply chain issues. The co-op noted that it doesn't expect ""significant impacts"" on the availability of its products.-- CNN Business' Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.",2
27," (CNN)You know what they say, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is all fun and games until one of the balloons goes down. Since the parade started marching balloons around Manhattan in 1927, the massive floating figures have occasionally come untethered, blown clear away, or been punctured, stabbed, deflated and subjected to all sorts of ignominy. While most of the balloon incidents are at least a little humorous (the hubris of man, to create such beasts!), a small handful of accidents have ended with people being seriously injured. Some of those cases have led the parade's organizers to change the rules regarding their most beloved -- and problematic -- parade participants. After all, a deflated Kermit here and there is just the way the parade floats, but there's nothing festive about people getting hurt. 1927: Felix is released to the giant cat motel in the skyImagine you're a parade-goer in 1927. There was no TV, no Disney World, and the Empire State Building wouldn't be constructed for another few years. Seeing the parade's first balloon, a giant and not at all spooky Felix the Cat, was probably big stuff. It all went swimmingly until it came time to deflate the dang thing. Apparently everyone had gotten so caught up in getting the cat in the air, they hadn't given much thought to, you know, getting it down and flat again. So, the balloon's handlers just kinda...let it go. Like a pie-eyed feline Icarus, dear Felix flew too close to the sun, and popped. 1956: Oh, how the Mighty Mouse has fallen Even the more routine balloon deflation always carry a bit of dramatic zeal. Take the fall of the Mighty Mouse balloon in 1956. It was a tale as old as time: Balloon meets street sign, street sign wins, balloon crumples helplessly to the ground. This one's just funny well, because, it's Mighty Mouse! He's supposed to fly! And be mighty! And yet, that day, he accomplished neither. 1957: Popeye hates you Popeye the Sailor Man has always been known for his coarse manner. True to form, in 1957 the Popeye balloon had  had all that he could stand, and couldn't stands no more. As a chilly rain blanketed the city, it collected in the top of Popeye's iconic sailor's cap. One tight turn was all it took for it to tip and dump gallons of water on unsuspecting spectators. Ah-gahgahgahgahgah!1991: Kermit the Frog is scarred for life Life was hard for the first Kermit balloon. In 1985, the frog was eviscerated after crashing into some trees, but managed to survive the rest of the parade. The more crippling blow came in 1991, when it lost in another encounter with a tree, which left is head deflated in a decidedly un-festive way. The balloon was never the same, and was retired shortly afterward. A new, improved and tree-resistant version was debuted in 2002. It did some journeyman work for the parade, retiring after two years and then returning for a few years starting in 2007, but things were never the same. The poor frog's balloon spirit had simply seen too much. 1997: The bad one If it is possible for every worst-case scenario to happen at once, the 1997 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade came really close. During the parade, high winds caused the the Cat in the Hat balloon to strike a lamppost, and part of the post came crashing down on the head of a bystander. The woman suffered serious injuries and was in a coma for a month. On high alert, police at the parade reined in, stabbed and stomped down the Barney and Pink Panther balloons to make sure they couldn't do any more damage. The incident caused parade officials to change requirements for the balloons, banning the super large and unwieldy ones. It also gave everyone a wake-up call about wind. That's why, if you ever hear chatter about the balloons being grounded due to high winds, you shouldn't groan in disappointment. It could be much, much worse if they're allowed to fly. ",2
28," (CNN)Jennifer Lawrence has revealed that she is ""nervous"" about returning to the spotlight after taking a step back when she felt ""everybody had gotten sick of me.""The Oscar winner spoke to Vanity Fair magazine for its December issue cover story in a wide-ranging interview, touching on the challenges of fame, a near-death experience, the trauma of having intimate photos leaked online and the gender pay gap.Lawrence, who is expecting a baby with husband Cooke Maroney, is due to make her return to the screen with Adam McKay's comedy ""Don't Look Up.""Speaking to Vanity Fair, the 31-year-old star said: ""I'm so nervous... I haven't spoken to the world in forever. And to come back now, when I have all of these new accessories added to my life that I obviously want to protect.""The interview touches on the movies Lawrence worked on before she took a step back from the spotlight, which included ""Passengers,"" ""Mother!"" ""Red Sparrow"" and ""Dark Phoenix.""""I was not pumping out the quality that I should have,"" she said. ""I just think everybody had gotten sick of me. I'd gotten sick of me.""Lawrence said she had started to think she couldn't do anything right.""If I walked a red carpet, it was, 'Why didn't she run?'... I think that I was people-pleasing for the majority of my life,"" she said.Now Lawrence is pregnant and, although she declined to talk about how she feels about becoming a mother, she did share her thoughts on protecting her child.""Every instinct in my body wants to protect their privacy for the rest of their lives, as much as I can. I don't want anyone to feel welcome into their existence. And I feel like that just starts with not including them in this part of my work,"" she said. In 2014, a hacker leaked nude photos of Lawrence and other female celebrities. The actress spoke about the impact this has had on her.""Anybody can go look at my naked body without my consent, any time of the day,"" she said. ""Somebody in France just published them. My trauma will exist forever.""She also recounted an experience from 2017 when a small private plane she was traveling on had to make a hard emergency landing after both of its engines failed.""Flying is horrific and I have to do it all the time,"" she said, explaining how she had started leaving ""little mental voicemails"" to her family as the plane hurtled towards the ground.Lawrence, previously named the world's highest-paid actress, also touched on the reported pay discrepancy between her and ""Don't Look Up"" co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. ""Look, Leo brings in more box office than I do. I'm extremely fortunate and happy with my deal. But in other situations, what I have seen -- and I'm sure other women in the workforce have seen as well -- is that it's extremely uncomfortable to inquire about equal pay,"" she said. ""And if you do question something that appears unequal, you're told it's not gender disparity but they can't tell you what exactly it is.""The film airs on Netflix next month and CNN has reached out to the streaming service for comment.Read the full cover story ""A Happy New Year"" by Karen Valby in Vanity Fair's December issue and on VanityFair.com.",2
29," (CNN)Sandra Bullock has shared the big screen with Keanu Reeves twice -- but she's down for a third and even has an idea. Speaking to Esquire magazine for a profile on her ""Speed"" co-star, Bullock said she'd ""love nothing more than to do a comedy with Keanu before we both die."" (Grim, but OK.) ""He's funny. We can be seventy-five—it'll be even better then, like an old-people 'Cocoon' thing,"" she told the publication. ""We play two funny old people. A road trip. Just put us in an RV as old people. It'll be the bookend of 'Speed'! We'll just be driving really slowly. Pissing the world off. There's our movie.""While waiting 18 years for this to happen doesn't sound appealing, the spirit of the idea is solid. Hollywood, your move. Elsewhere in the profile, by writer Ryan D'Agostino, Bullock recounted working with the ""Matrix"" actor on the iconic action movie in the early 90s and the bond they shared after. (In 2006, they'd star together again in ""The Lake House."") Though they were never romantically involved, she said, Reeves was and remains and uniquely thoughtful person. She told one story about offhandedly mentioning in a conversation with Reeves that'd she'd never had Champagne and truffles, only to have him show up at her door days later with flowers, Champagne and truffles. ""That's what I mean that it drives you crazy,"" Bullock told the magazine. ""When I first met him, I would spend as much time as I could filling a silence, just to feel comfortable. And the more I jibber-jabbered on, the quieter he would get. And I thought, I don't understand what's happening! He's looking at me with eyes of confusion. He's quiet. Did I say something to offend him? And then a day or two later, he would arrive with a note or a little package, saying, 'I thought about what you said.' And he would have his response.""She added: ""How many people do you know like that?""One, Sandra. And the Internet would say, he's breathtaking. ",2
30,"New York (CNN Business)The holiday travel season is off to a relatively smooth start, with good weather and few canceled flights. But many in the industry are worried that luck won't hold all the way until the holiday season ends just after New Year's. Major US airlines are operating with fewer pilots and flight attendants than they were before the pandemic. With domestic airline bookings nearly back to normal, airlines are trying to do more with less this holiday season.Service meltdowns in October at Southwest Airlines and American demonstrate what happens when schedules get disrupted without the staffing levels needed to rapidly recover from canceled flights. Problems quickly cascade, resulting in hundreds of additional cancellations.""I do think all of the airlines are stretched thin,"" said Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. ""A major blizzard or event could cause prolonged delays and cancellations.""And anyone who has their flight canceled is going to run into problems finding an alternative way to get where they're going.""If there are issues, reaccommodating people whose flights are canceled will be tough. The planes are very full,"" said Savi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James.Staffing shortagesThe airlines that have experienced recent service disruptions admitted they didn't have enough staff to deal with the problems.Bob Jordan, who is set to become CEO of Southwest early next year, told investors last month that weather and air traffic control issues caused ""a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position and then that took several days to recover.""""We inconvenienced thousands of customers and we further challenged our stellar employees,"" he said. ""And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees.""Jordan said Southwest is making additional trims to its schedule to make sure that doesn't happen again.When air traffic ground to a near halt during the early months of the pandemic, all the airlines used early retirement packages and buyouts to reduce staff voluntarily. All are scrambling to staff up now, but it takes time to hire, train and certify pilots and flight attendants, so much of the current hiring is being done with an eye toward next summer's travel season — not this fall and winter — said Syth.All the airlines say they're prepared to deal with disruptions caused by weather or other issues like air traffic control snafus.""To ensure we're providing certainty for both our customers and team members, we're doubling down on our efforts related to our schedule and staffing,"" said David Seymour, American's chief operating officer, in a note to the airline's staff. ""On the scheduling front, we've ensured that our November and December are built to meet customers demand and that they are fully supportable by our staffing.""But Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union at American and an active pilot himself, said he's concerned that American is stretching its staffing too thin.""We want to fly these flights. But the evidence from earlier this year shows what happens when things don't go as planned,"" he said. ""They're building the schedule right to the maximum number of flights possible and it provides no flexibility for when things go wrong. Airplanes don't fly on hope."" Southwest is trying to operate its current schedule with about 15% fewer pilots than it had before the pandemic, according to Murray, even though the number of flights hasn't been trimmed by nearly that much. That leaves much less ability to recover when issues do crop up.Fewer flightsOverall the number of domestic flights planned from last weekend to just after New Year's Day is down 12% compared to the same period in 2019, according to data from Cirium, an  airline data tracking service. Among the big four US airlines that handle about 80% of air traffic, Southwest and American have the most aggressive schedules compared to their pre-pandemic levels. The number of flights is down just 10% at Southwest and 9% at American, while Delta and United are both down more than 13% compared to 2019.Executives at United and Delta say their more limited schedule should allow them to avoid the service issues experienced at Southwest and American earlier this fall.""If we wanted to be bigger than we are, quite honestly we couldn't be. We could be a little bit, maybe, but not much bigger without risking the operational performance issues like you've seen at some of [the] other carriers,"" Delta president Glen Hauenstein told investors last month. ""So we want to stay where we're confident that we can actually fly the schedules that we put out there.""""Our North Star in this recovery is making sure we do the right thing for customers and if that means sacrificing some possible short-term profits to ensure a reliable operation, then so be it,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby in a letter to customers explaining his airline's reduced schedule.Murray, the head of the Southwest pilots union, says his airline has made changes in its operations since the service meltdown in October that resulted in 2,000 flights being canceled over a weekend, and tens of thousands of stranded passengers. ""I'm not as gravely concerned as I was throughout the summer,"" he said.",2
31,"New York (CNN Business)Expect to pay more for some of your favorite cereals, snacks, soups and cooking brands next year.General Mills (GIS) notified retail customers that it's raising prices in mid-January on hundreds of items across dozens of brands. They include Annie's, Progresso, Yoplait, Fruit Roll-Ups, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Cheerios, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charm's, Wheaties, Reese's Puffs, Trix and more, according to letters General Mills sent to at least one major regional wholesale supplier last week. For some items, prices will go up by around 20% beginning next year.The wholesaler shared General Mills' letters with CNN Business on the condition of anonymity to protect the company's relationship with its suppliers. A leader at the company said it plans to push along all of the increases to its grocery and convenience store customers. He expects they will then pass them down to shoppers.A spokesperson for General Mills did not provide a comment for this story.If more General Mills' customers — including the leading big box stores, supermarkets, drug stores and other chains in the United States — decide to do the same, these familiar brands will get more expensive for shoppers.General Mills' plans are the latest evidence that rising prices won't be going away anytime soon for some of the most recognizable food and household brands. The company is the latest consumer manufacturer to announce price hikes beginning next year, joining Tyson (TSN), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Mondelez (MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Kimberly Clark (KMB) and others.Rising pricesGrocery prices have increased sharply during the pandemic, after stagnating from 2015 through 2019. Prices climbed 1% in October from September and were 5.4% higher than at the same time last year, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Inflation on food, beverages and household basics will climb to 8% during the first half of 2022 before settling at 4% during the latter half of the year, projects IRI, a market research firm. IRI tracks prices, point-of-sale and volume data, promotions and trends at big-box stores, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, pharmacies and other consumer channels. Food manufacturers and grocery chains have faced higher costs for commodities, labor, transportation and other expenses during the pandemic. Those costs have escalated in recent months, prompting them to raise prices to minimize the impact.The producer-price index, which measures the price manufacturers receive for their goods and services, jumped 0.6% last month from September and rose 8.6% annually.General Mills said in the letters that it was responding to higher materials and labor costs. ""The current operating environment is as dynamic as we've experienced in at least a decade, resulting in significant input cost inflation, labor shortages, and challenges servicing the business,"" General Mills said. General Mills said in September that it expects its input cost inflation to be 7% to 8% for its 2022 fiscal year.Uneven impactRising inflation does not impact all shoppers equally. ""Inflation has been more painful for lower-income households,"" Bank of America economists said in a research report last week. That's because they are more exposed to the goods that are seeing prices rise the fastest, such as gas and rent, and they save less than higher-income groups. Some grocery chains are raising prices more quickly than competitors, depending on how much flexibility they have to handle higher costs. Walmart (WMT), the largest grocer in the United States, said its price gaps with competitors are wider than they were before the pandemic because the company is absorbing some costs instead of passing them on. Walmart accounted for 29% of General Mills' sales last year.",2

33," (CNN)Even after the rise and resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, the elections of a Black president and Vice President and several years of racial reckoning over state violence against Black men and women, if you want it's still plain to see how far some parts of the US haven't come on race. Just look at the trial of Travis McMichael, William ""Roddie"" Bryan and Travis's father Gregory McMichael for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. The details of the case are themselves stunning. According to his family, Arbery -- a runner -- was out for a jog. Two White men, claiming concern about local break-ins, grabbed their guns, jumped in a truck, pursued Arbery, later joined by a third White man. One of those men shot and killed Arbery with a shotgun. The McMichaels say they were defending themselves while attempting to make a ""citizen's arrest"" -- yet Travis McMichael testified during the trial Arbery never threatened any of the men now on trial for his killing. That a group of White men felt justified in chasing a Black man through their neighborhood -- even a man they believe had committed burglary (not a capital offense) -- and then felt they deserve to get off scot-free after one of them shoots him dead is egregious enough. But compounding this egregiousness is the racist attack launched on the victim by a member of the defense team. On Monday, defense attorney Laura Hogue went as far as to say during her closing argument in the case, ""Turning Ahmaud Arbery into a victim after the choices he made does not reflect the reality of what brought Ahmaud Arbery to Satilla Shores in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails."" What does the state of Arbery's pedicure have to do with whether the man who shot him is guilty of murder? Nothing. There is no conceivable justification for Hogue, in her role as her client's advocate, to cite such details, other than a blatant attempt to paint a racially coded picture in jurors' minds of Arbery as less than human, as a dirty beast who posed a legitimate threat. A person the members of the jury -- nearly all of whom are also White -- might not want in their own neighborhoods, either. It was, it seems, a naked ploy to weaponize White fear in order to secure an acquittal for her client. Arbery's mother left the courtroom in shock and disgust. She told CNN's Anderson Cooper she was appalled the defense attempted to ""dehumanize"" her son. It was a shameful display, and the kind of character assassination tactic of someone who doesn't believe they can win on the merits. ""Literally after those men in that courtroom assassinated their child, now they're sitting here assassinating his character,"" said family attorney Benjamin Crump. It was also a familiar ploy in the sad, long history of racist violence in the United States. Over and over again, Black victims are trashed and their names tarnished after their deaths in an effort to justify the violence against them. These portrayals go back to the days of slavery, and particularly to the Reconstruction era, when many Whites felt threatened by newfound Black freedom. Lynchings and killings, including the murder of Emmett Till, a child, were justified by the claim that Black men and boys had raped or otherwise assaulted White women. The image of Black men as brutes and savages is acutely captured in the pro-Ku-Klux-Klan film ""Birth of a Nation."" Decades and over a century later in some cases, these portrayals have shifted, but they haven't gone away. When White people commit acts of violence against Black people, Black men, women, and even children are routinely slandered as scary, threatening, and animalistic, the message being the white assailant or murderer was acting in self-defense -- and the Black victim had it coming. This same trope remains employed so often that ""he was no angel"" — the line trotted out, often by conservative and even some mainstream news outlets, after the killings of Black men and boys — is widely understood as a clichéd trope. Even 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot by a cop when he was on the playground, was called a ""thug"" by a police union president and blamed for his own death. And now here is Arbery, with the state of his toenails used to try to justify his killing. The question now is whether the jury will fall for it -- or whether, after so much has changed and so much has stayed the same, they'll see these disgusting tactics for what they are. I hope that as they deliberate, whatever outcome they reach, they will reject this attempted victim-blaming, and pursue justice for Ahmaud Arbery. But the long history that set the scene for Arbery's murder, and that is playing into the defense strategy of the men who pursued him and the one who pulled the trigger, won't go away when the jury renders its verdict. That's up to all of us: To name these racist tropes, to understand their insidiousness, and to reject them. ",2
34," (CNN)It should have come as no surprise the first interview Kyle Rittenhouse gave after his acquittal would go to Tucker Carlson. Rittenhouse, who claimed self-defense after fatally shooting two people and wounding another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has become a heroic figure on the right, lauded for his willingness to defend property and defend himself with deadly force during the protests.But recently, his acquittal on all charges added another layer to his status: now he also became a victim of political persecution, unjustly prosecuted by the state and viciously slandered by liberal media and Democratic politicians. That is how Tucker Carlson presented him, adding Rittenhouse to the new pantheon of right-wing victim-heroes he is building. On both his prime-time show on Fox News and his propaganda documentaries running on the streaming service Fox Nation, Carlson has become one of the most prominent promoters of the narrative now defining conservatism in the US: that right-wing violence is not a problem, that White supremacy is a hoax, and that the real threat to democracy is the Democratic-Party-Deep-State alliance. And at Fox News, where Carlson advances this narrative each night, the network has made clear they're sticking with Tucker, ensuring his indoctrination lines will be repeated across the network.In the interview with Rittenhouse aired Monday night, Carlson emphasized his belief Rittenhouse was a virtuous young man. During the pre-recorded interview, in which Rittenhouse recalled the shootings in polished detail, Carlson not only underscored the righteousness of the teen's actions, but showed a soft spot for Rittenhouse himself. He introduced Rittenhouse as ""bright, decent, sincere, dutiful, and hardworking... exactly the kind of person you would want many more of in your country."" During the interview, he joked with Rittenhouse about their shared propensity for gaining weight, while during a break, he said to his audience, ""What a sweet kid.""Shortly after commenting on the shooter's sweetness, Carlson offered his viewers a summary of his Rittenhouse narrative: ""The picture that emerges is of a working-class kid who sincerely believes in America. His community falls apart, and he tries his best to do the right thing, at a time when almost no one else in the community is trying to do the right thing. But he does. And in return for that, the state, under political pressure, throws him in prison.""Carlson has obviously skipped over a key part of the story — where Rittenhouse killed two people. He does so to underscore his broader message to his audience: this could be you or your child. You, the person who loves your country. You, the person who wants to defend your community. You, the person who believes you're doing the right thing, even when it requires standing alone. And when you do all these things, you are at risk of being unjustly targeted by politicians and prosecutors and the Deep State.It's the same argument Carlson made just a few weeks ago on his conspiratorial documentary, ""Patriot Purge,"" his retelling of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. In it, he presented the insurrectionists as good, patriotic Americans, nonviolent protesters who had been set up by the FBI and other Deep-State forces. He warned a second War on Terror was underway, this time aimed directly at conservatives and Trump supporters. The documentary, which ran on Fox Nation, will be followed in a few weeks by one called ""The Trial of Kyle,"" drawn from hours of interviews and behind-the-scenes filming during the trial. Though Carlson remains Fox News's biggest star, not everyone on the network is on board with his conspiratorial vision of vigilante conservatism. Earlier this week, Fox News contributors and Never-Trumpers Jonah Goldberg and Steven Hayes quit the network, citing ""Patriot Purge"" as their reason. ""It traffics in all manner of innuendo and conspiracy theories that I think legitimately could lead to violence,"" Goldberg said in an interview with NPR's David Folkenflik. ""That for me, and for Steve, was the last straw.""Their departure comes nearly five years after the network went all in on Donald Trump, replacing Trump skeptics like Megyn Kelly and George Will with some of his most ardent supporters, including Carlson and Laura Ingraham. The network's Trump boosterism was hard to miss, yet so too was giving up lucrative commentator slots. It took ""Patriot Purge"" to finally stir their consciences to the point of departure. The network's leading news anchors, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, also objected to the documentary, running their complaints all the way up to Lachlan Murdoch, the chair and CEO of Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News. To no avail: the documentary ran, and Fox continues to show its support not only for Carlson's programming but for the conspiratorial, violent, racist content its viewers — and many Republican Party voters — seem to desire.   And that is a key takeaway for the network's embrace of Carlson: though he plays a powerful role in stitching together events like the insurrection and the Rittenhouse trial into a coherent narrative of conservative grievance and virtue, the underlying appeal plays on the preferences of the network's and the party's conservative base. The right had made Rittenhouse a hero while the bodies of the people he shot were still warm. Carlson is there to tell them not only was Rittenhouse right, but they were right, too. ",2
35," (CNN)I was 11 years old when I left Los Angeles for the first time. My mother, wanting to celebrate my recovery from a mild case of polio, drove us to Yosemite National Park.It's been more than seven decades, but I still remember our car emerging from the nearly mile-long Wawona Tunnel and seeing the famous landscape of Yosemite from Inspiration Point. I knew immediately that I was somewhere special. Since then, I've been fortunate to travel to national parks across the country. I've even created films about many of them. In doing so, I've come to learn that our national parks not only protect our country's most spectacular natural wonders but also its stories and its history.Once I had a family of my own, I drove my children around the US to experience these places themselves. One of our favorite spots was Chaco, a remote canyon in the American Southwest. Within Chaco, we could explore the remains of what was once the center of a bustling and sophisticated Puebloan civilization that existed hundreds of years before Europeans first set foot on this continent. We were drawn to the history of the area, where we'd learn how Chaco's famous ancient structures spread across the remote desert landscape, a place to which many tribal nations and communities maintain active connections today.We explored the remains of structures built at least a millennium earlier, designs that would have stood taller and larger than anything built for hundreds of years afterward. Moving across the sun-weathered terrain, we would take in a place so remarkable it was made a World Heritage site by UNESCO.Being up close to this ancient history can make you feel small. And you feel your connection to the land while treading the same paths that others walked more than a thousand years ago to reach what was, to them, the center of their world.Today, we look back in awe at their monumental achievements. Sometimes, I wonder what they would think if they could look forward in time and see how we've treated the natural world.Chaco Culture National Historical Park protects around 33,000 acres in the area, but the magic of Chaco is spread out beyond that. The National Parks Conservation Association estimates that as many as 5,000 sacred Chacoan cultural and historical sites lay outside of the protective shield of the park.Unfortunately, these sacred and unprotected landscapes around Chaco have long been targeted for oil and gas drilling that desecrates what was once the center of an ancient civilization, and a part of the history of our continent and our species.I have feared for Chaco many times over the last few decades as proposals to drill for oil on the landscape were continuously granted. Temporary reprieves won by tribes and conservation groups averted some proposals. But despite those efforts, sacred lands and important archeological places still became drilling sites, bringing with them access roads and heavy-goods vehicles that cut through even more of the landscape.This is why this month's announcement that the Biden administration is finally taking an important step toward protecting one of the world's most culturally influential landscapes is so significant. The proposal for a 20-year ban of new oil and gas drilling on federal lands within a 10-mile radius around Chaco Culture National Historical Park is necessary.This landscape -- and others like it -- tells a story about the history of our country and humankind itself. Ancient people would travel for hundreds of miles to reach this cultural center, which has left behind archeological mysteries that continue to perplex us more than a thousand years later. These places remain sacred to the Pueblo and Navajo communities, and they should be incredibly important to all of us.There are many places with such rich histories around our nation. And while I am thankful that Chaco Canyon will now get the protection it deserves, we must do better in protecting the sacred lands of those who were here long before us.The Badger-Two Medicine area south of Glacier National Park has been the spiritual home and cultural center for the Blackfeet Nation for thousands of years, but tribal members and many others are still fighting to permanently heal and protect the lands that were targeted more than 30 years ago for oil drilling.Avi Kwa Ame in the Nevada desert is a sacred landscape for 10 Yuman-speaking tribes, as well as the Hopi and Chemehuevi Paiute. For many in the area, it is where all life was created. It has petroglyphs that date back centuries, and yet it is routinely threatened by reckless proposals for new energy development.Not even the Grand Canyon -- America's most famous natural attraction -- is safe. The Havasupai tribe, who live within the Canyon on their traditional lands, are still bravely fighting an epic battle to permanently protect their land from uranium mining on lands surrounding the park that threatens their only source of water.The United States is not even 250 years old. Meanwhile, these places collectively hold thousands of years' worth of history, culture and stories. We must preserve these lands.Even as an 11-year-old at Yosemite, I knew immediately I was somewhere awe-inspiring, and I still get that feeling to this day every time I visit Chaco Canyon. Some places are too special.",2
36," (CNN)As we gather this Thanksgiving, many families will have an empty chair at the table. Covid-19 took so many of our loved ones, and we will be grieving these losses. Others may be absent because they are quarantining, taking extra precautions or choosing not to travel.  For many families, there may be another reason for those empty places at the table: disagreements too strong to permit physical togetherness. Some people have entered so far into a world fueled by disinformation that they can no longer converse with those who don't share their views on issues like public health or politics. A February 2021 CBS/YouGov poll revealed that 57% of Republicans consider Democrats not just political opponents but enemies. The poll showed that 41% of Democrats see Republicans the same way.  With the holidays approaching, the deepening polarization can play out in painful ways, and add another layer of tension to social and family gatherings. Almost everyone I know worries about ruptured or strained relationships with friends or family members who are caught up in a vortex of disinformation and immersed in alternate versions of reality, including the popular conspiracy theory QAnon.  I know what it's like to see a loved one drift away until they are unreachable through logic, reason or evidence. During the pandemic, a family member previously known for her common sense became radicalized. She lives in England and strict lockdowns there meant that coffees and lunches with friends of all political persuasions turned into extra hours in front of the television watching her new favorite source of information, Russia Today (RT). The Kremlin-backed broadcaster, which has a broad reach with nearly two dozen bureaus around the world, is key to Russian information warfare that aims to get non-Russians to see the world in ways that benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies. It worked like a charm on her. As her frustration with the pandemic's disruptions of life increased, so did her need to find someone, or something, to blame. Our phone conversations turned one-sided as she scapegoated immigrants for the spread of Covid-19 and, starting in January 2021, ranted about how Joe Biden was ruining America, her country of residence for many years.   By summer 2021, she no longer asked for news of me and other family members. Months of RT had left her deep in a world of disinformation, and she grew increasingly angry. In June, after the Biden-Putin summit, she complained that Biden wasn't helping Putin expand in Eastern Europe (it's notable that she had never once mentioned Putin before becoming an avid consumer of RT).  When I asked her to watch a clip of my live commentary on NBC, in which I talked about Putin's imperialist policies, she became incensed and yelled, ""You're a liar!"" before she hung up the phone. Feeling frustrated, I stopped communicating with her. As it turns out, this was a counter-productive move.   Like radicalization, disengagement is a process. There is no quick and easy way to lead someone back into reality, or to defuse their trigger points on issues they care about, even if evidence becomes overwhelming that their positions have no foundation.  In fact, followers of cults and authoritarian dogma who begin to doubt the truth of their convictions may initially dig their heels in. The more an individual has invested in the alternate reality, the more they are reluctant to admit to others, and to themselves, that they have misjudged the situation. Many prefer to live in denial rather than experience the shame or humiliation that they were wrong. For some, this urge to save face can be a powerful force even in life and death situations, as sociologist Brooke Harrington writes of pandemic and vaccine deniers who have fallen sick with Covid-19 and continue to uphold their views while in the ICU.                 This is why, as we get together this holiday season, we might heed the advice of experts like Steven Hassan, who encourages people not to cast judgment or reprimand their loved ones who are immersed in disinformation. We might also resist the temptation to present individuals with evidence of the falsity of their beliefs; I know from my own experience that such evidence often comes from sources that these loved ones consider to be ""fake news,"" and will be immediately dismissed - even if, in my case, that news is written by a family member. What we can do is keep them close and find common ground on other issues, as hard as that might be. This does not mean we accept or validate their racist or anti-science beliefs, but rather aim to be strategic. After all, if we cut them off or yell at them, we simply magnify the chances that they will remain siloed among like-minded people. ",2
37," (CNN)Legendary Black radio host Joe Madison is two weeks into a hunger strike that could become a risk to his health. Madison, 72, is doing it for one reason: To pressure President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress to pass voting rights legislation as the GOP actively works to restrict ballot access.As Madison told CNN's Don Lemon on Friday, ""Just as food is essential for the existence of life, voting is essential for the existence of democracy.""Madison, a civil rights activist turned SiriusXM radio host who was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2019, is so committed to the cause he is willing to put his life on the line. When I spoke to Madison on my own radio show a few days into his hunger strike, he shared that his wife asked him, ""Are you telling me that you are willing to die for this cause?"" He said he looked at her and responded with one word: ""Yes."" Madison then added passionately, ""This is the new civil rights movement.""More than 50 years after the Voting Rights Act, no one should have to risk their life to ensure all Americans can exercise a constitutionally protected right to vote. But that's where we are in 2021 America thanks to the GOP. It was not Donald Trump's ""Big Lie"" about non-existent election fraud but his ""Big Loss"" in the 2020 election that has animated Republicans to pass 33 laws in 19 states since January to make it more difficult to vote. Today's GOP won't allow the democratic will of the people to stand in their way of acquiring and retaining political power.The GOP's effort to ""cancel"" voting rights is a threat to all Americans who believe in democracy, regardless of race. But it is a particular threat to Black Americans, who have been targeted in Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, and who have been historically disenfranchised with Jim Crow era laws designed to make it almost impossible for them to vote without the danger of deadly violence.Just one example is World War II veteran Maceo Snipes, who stood up to that threat when he became the only Black person to vote in the 1946 primary in Taylor County, Georgia. A few days after the election, a group of White men showed up at Snipes' door, where they asked him to step outside. When Snipes did, they shot him. Snipes later died from the shooting, and charges were never brought against his killers. Mr. Snipes, though, was far from the only Black person or allies of other races who was killed in the pursuit of access to the ballot for African Americans. The GOP's voter suppression campaign is not only a threat to our democracy today but it's also an insult to the memory of Snipes and all others who have toiled, bled and died simply for the right to cast a ballot. In his first speech after defeating Trump in the 2020 election, President Biden credited Black voters for being a large part of his win. ""The African American community stood up again for me,"" he said of the community that voted nearly 90 percent in his favor in last year's election. He then pledged, ""You've always had my back, and I'll have yours.""Countless callers to my radio show who are Black have cited that line to express their disappointment in Biden's failing to have their backs on voting rights. Instead, Biden has been laser-focused for months on his infrastructure and social safety net legislation. But what's the use of shining bridges if you don't have a functioning democracy? With Biden's success last week in both signing the bipartisan infrastructure bill into law and his broader Build Back Better bill passing the House, he must now make voting rights reform his public priority.To be fair, the Democrats in the House already passed two different voting rights bills this year, the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. But Republicans in the Senate have blocked progress on both.There has also been a glimmer of hope in recent months with the Senate Democrats drafting the Freedom to Vote Act, which would provide a national standard for federal elections as well as end partisan gerrymandering. All 50 Democratic Senators supported the bill, meaning this could pass if brought to a vote with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. But due to the filibuster requiring 10 GOP Senators to consent to even allow a vote, this measure has been blocked with not one Republican senator in support. You can see why former President Barack Obama last year called the filibuster a ""Jim Crow relic,"" as the GOP is now using it to block legislation that would protect against voter suppression.The Democrats' failure to make voting rights a top priority may also explain why, in the recent Virginia gubernatorial race, Black voters were a smaller percentage of the electorate (16%) than in 2020 (18%), and only 86% voted for the Democratic candidate compared to 89% who went for Biden in 2020. In a close election, this kind of drop-off can decide the winner.In 2021, who would have thought -- as Joe Madison put it -- that we'd be engaged in a ""new civil rights movement""? But this is where our nation finds itself as the GOP rejects a robust democracy in the pursuit of electoral autocracy. It's time President Biden and the Democrats make voting rights the top issue in 2022. Biden should travel the country selling it, in addition to publicly -- and very doggedly -- pressuring Senate Democrats to end the filibuster. Biden owes that to the Black community who supported him, and to all Americans who believe that their vote and their voice matters.",2
38," (CNN)Note: This essay contains spoilers for season two of ""The Morning Show."" Four years after a wave of #MeToo revelations toppled titans in the entertainment world who abused their power, US culture continues to contend with the question of what to do with toxic men, and what's next for the movement.  Apple TV+'s star-studded original series ""The Morning Show,"" launched in 2019, considers behind-the-scenes troubles at a morning news show through the lens of #MeToo, and demonstrates the challenges to answering these questions of second acts. Based in part on CNN's Brian Stelter's 2013 book ""Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV"" (Stelter is a consulting producer on the series) and with obvious narrative parallels to the history of NBC's ""Today"" show, season one of ""The Morning Show"" starts with the firing of the show's beloved male anchor after revelations of sexual misconduct and investigates the contours of complicity and the effects of abuse of power.  Grappling with the fallout after the firing of anchor Mitch Kessler, played with humanizing force by Steve Carell, are the series' central characters Alex Levy, co-anchor of the show played with stunning nuance by Jennifer Aniston; and Bradley Jackson, Alex's new hotheaded on-air partner portrayed by an impassioned Reese Witherspoon. The show's examination of second acts plays out not only in terms of Mitch's character, but also in the storylines of Alex and Bradley, who wrestle with other forms of workplace abuse, boundaries of workplace responsibility and issues of journalistic integrity.  The series' second season, which began September 17, 2021, follows a painful rupture -- both within the world of the show and, in a self-referential way, about the world of entertainment after #MeToo. While the show occasionally flounders, it also responds to an urgent cultural need to process misconduct and locate pathways toward healing, demonstrating in an all-too-relatable fictional reality that often it is the women, not the men, who work the hardest to change themselves and invest in authentic second acts. Taking up broader cultural concerns about #MeToo's reverberations, a major storyline of season two follows Mitch's halting attempts to grapple with his actions. After being accosted by an angry American woman while he's eating gelato in Italy, Mitch meets documentarian Paola Lambruschini (Valeria Golino), who summarizes the problematic nature of a second act after society cancels a #MeToo abuser, saying of the American accoster: ""She doesn't know what she wants from you. If you apologize, she says it's insincere. If you try to do good for the world, it's self-serving. If you dare to live your life, 'the gall.' If you choose to die, then you're taking the coward's way out. You must live and suffer. But you mustn't do it in front of us and you mustn't try to learn from it.""  Indeed, the series' second season preoccupation with the question of what's next for toxic men offers no satisfying answers. Mitch may make some progress understanding the trauma his actions caused, and his mentorship of Paola as she works on a documentary about rape law in Italy represents halting steps toward doing good for the world. But when new accusations arise claiming his predatory behavior disproportionally targeted Black women, Mitch takes what Paola identifies as ""the coward's way out"" -- he allows his car to careen over a cliff, raising questions of whether ""The Morning Show"" itself takes an easy approach to the question of what to do with toxic men. ""The Morning Show"" demonstrates that second acts for sexual predators continue to be unimaginable, but it's not clear that ""canceling"" them, rather than the much more uncomfortable act of holding them accountable, provides the opportunity for what #MeToo founder Tarana Burke has said lies at the heart of the movement: ""radical community healing"" (also note that canceling here seems to take the form of holing up in a million-dollar mansion in Lake Como). Mitch dies having never taken responsibility for his actions.  The show denies us examples of men improving, although we do see gestures toward growth through Alex's character. Alex responds to the toxic men in her life by becoming a toxic force of her own, myopically focused on not being canceled herself. For all her narcissism, though, audiences are treated to glimpses of what accountability might look like via Alex's journey.  In the season two finale, Alex does a solo, hourlong livestream from her penthouse, talking about being diagnosed with Covid-19 and what it's like living under intense public scrutiny. Filmed with Aniston staring directly into the camera, the speech grows increasingly uncomfortable to watch, an indictment of the real-world fixation on human failure and schadenfreude.  The suggestion that therapy might play a role in creating the foundations for a real reckoning with the past haunts the show, without fully committing to the benefits of counseling (as the wildly successful ""Ted Lasso"" did by structuring its entire second season around the importance of attending to mental health). Bradley's love interest, journalist Laura Peterson (played with delightful queer energy by Juliana Margulies) suggests multiple times to Bradley that she needs therapy. Laura's own unflappable demeanor provides some evidence of its positive effects (her honest exchange with Alex in the penultimate episode about the way the two gossiped about each other in the past is further evidence). Bradley however shows no indications of planning to seek counseling, and despite small gestures toward repairing harm, the primary characters in ""The Morning Show"" continue to spin out of control.  Zooming out, all this concern with second acts echoes the real-life career trajectory of the show's female leads, Aniston and Witherspoon. Expanding cultural approaches to the idea of ""America's Sweetheart,"" both beloved actresses, along with season two standout Margulies, offer refreshing representations of successful television women. It's a revelation to see three middle-aged, powerhouse female actors, with their wrinkles and reading glasses, take on a culture that enables abuse of power by toxic men.  In her new memoir ""Going There,"" Katie Couric writes of the conditions that enabled Matt Lauer and others to prey on women in the workplace. While her story is oversimplified, Couric deserves recognition for writing about some of the tumultuous events related to Lauer's firing and grappling with her own accountability in them.  Rebecca Traister points out that Couric, whose book prompted some sexist and mean-spirited headlines, was ""pilloried for doing the heavy, ugly lifting of investigating nasty power dynamics and her own participation in them, while her male peers, many of whom have bombed out in their own spectacular ways, aren't sitting around asking themselves hard questions."" These are the hypocritical contours of the tightrope act women perform to balance likability and accountability, while ""The Morning Show"" folds in a third layer of self-preservation. In this sense, ""The Morning Show"" mirrors real life, with more women focusing on their own complicity and doing some of the important emotional work toward a healthier future -- and enduring public scorn for doing so -- while more men opt for easier paths.  This kind of investigation into the past and projection into the future requires messy, emotional labor. Perhaps the show's third act will reveal glimpses at how a healthy workplace might operate -- and perhaps men will start to do the work. ",2
39,"New Delhi (CNN)Gulpreet Singh begs for food from a dirty hemp mat spread on the sidewalk outside Delhi's South Campus metro station.Like millions of Indians who survive on handouts or daily wages, the 84-year-old says he has no choice but to be outside, breathing air thick with smog in the Indian capital.""I come here and wait. Sometimes, people give me food,"" said Singh, his voice straining over the noise of auto rickshaws and cars belching fumes just meters away.Delhi is often ranked among the world's most polluted cities, and air pollution there reached ""hazardous"" levels in early November, according to India's National Air Quality Index (AQI), which tracks the presence of harmful particles in the air.But some Delhi residents have become so accustomed to bad air that it's a part of daily life -- they barely notice it, they say.Others say it's making them sick.Choking on smog    A police officer directing traffic at one of Delhi's busy junctions says pollution levels have become ""unbearable"" this winter.""I've taken off my mask because I need to blow the whistle to stop traffic, but it's been horrible,"" said the 48-year-old officer, who didn't reveal his name because he is not authorized to speak to the media.Exhaust fumes flow from the rows of vehicles around him -- he says he finds it hard to catch his breath.""My eyes hurt. It's hard to breathe. It's not easy,"" he said.Social worker Neelam Joshi, 39, says she feels the pollution every time she steps out of her house to catch the train to work.""When you leave the house in the morning, that's the first thing which hits you,"" Joshi said. By the end of the day, she says her body seems to have adjusted, but the next day, it happens all over again.""In the last six years that I have lived in Delhi, there's never been a reduction in pollution,"" she said. ""It only increases every year. Every year we reach a different level, and during festivals it always becomes worse.""Amanpreet Kaur, 28, a flight attendant from Delhi's Rohini area, recently crewed a flight from the United States and was stunned by the difference in air quality.""When I landed back into India, after my flight from USA, it was horrible. I'm continuously coughing,"" she said.Kaur says the smog is so bad that you can see it at night as a dirty haze around street lamps and car headlights.""When the sun sets, all you see is smog, just smog all around,"" Kaur said.""It's very dangerous to live in Delhi.""'My right to breathe'Aditya Dubey, an 18-year-old environmental activist, has spent the past two years lobbying for urgent action against Delhi's pollution.Every year, the city is plagued by a throat-searing cloud of murky smog, but it's worse in winter when lower temperatures and a drop in wind speed trap particles in the air for longer.""Winter has become a torture and every day feels like a punishment,"" Dubey said. ""I have a burning sensation in my eyes and they start watering. I feel breathless.""Last month, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tried to control pollution levels by banning firecrackers for Diwali, the festival of lights, but celebrations mostly proceeded as normal.The smoke from Diwali was exacerbated by a spike in the burning of crop waste in surrounding farmlands.By November 5, most locations in Delhi were recording an AQI above 500 -- the highest level on the scale.At that point, Dubey had had enough.The activist filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking protection for his ""right to breathe.""On November 15, the court ruled in his favor and ordered the central government to do more. Subsequently, schools were shut, non-essential traffic was suspended, construction projects were halted, and six out of 11 coal-fired plants were ordered to close until the end of November.Construction projects resumed Monday as Delhi recorded a marginal improvement in air quality. But for many, the damage had already been done.The 'silent killer'Delhi is not the only Indian city choked by smog.Last year, nine of the world's 10 most polluted cities were in India, according to monitoring network IQAir.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths a year globally, mainly as a result of increased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory infections.Bad air could be reducing the life expectancy of hundreds of millions of Indians by as much as nine years, according to a recent study by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).The study also found that every single one of India's 1.3 billion residents endure annual average pollution levels that exceed guidelines set by WHO.In 2019, the central government announced a national clean air campaign, with an aim to reduce particulate pollution by up to 30% by 2024. Specific plans were created for each city; in Delhi, those plans included measures to reduce road traffic, burn-offs and road dust, and to encourage the use of cleaner fuels.But in the past few years, India's pollution problem has worsened, partly due to the country's dependency on fossil fuels -- and in particular, coal.At the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, India was among a group of countries that pushed for an 11th-hour amendment to the agreement to phase ""down"" coal rather than phase it ""out"".In Delhi, noxious air is claiming tens of thousands of lives each year, according to analysis of IQAir data by Greenpeace.But despite the worsening air quality, some Delhi locals have become so accustomed to it they don't seem to notice.Many roam the streets without a face mask and have developed a general complacency toward pollution levels.Omprakash Mali, a 50-year-old gardener, say the air pollution doesn't affect him or his work.""We work with mud and in dust as a gardener, so I don't feel anything additional,"" he said. ""I think the top priority for the government should still be Covid-19. Pollution happens every year.""Meanwhile, Shesh Babu, 18, a manual laborer, said he ""doesn't really care"" about Delhi's thick smog. His priority is earning money.Dubey, the activist, says air pollution is considered to be an ""elitist"" issue.""Air pollution is a silent killer,"" he said. ""There is a lack of awareness. People don't realize the seriousness of it.""",2
40,"Berdyansk, Ukraine  (CNN)The Ukrainian naval patrol boat ""Kremenchuk"" churns out into the gun-grey waters of the Sea of Azov, one mounted machine gun pointing aft, another pointing fore into the drizzle.Commander Ivan Ovchar explains his ship's mission: ""To defend and maintain the sovereignty of Ukraine.""The threat, the officer and many of Ukraine's allies believe, comes from Russia.For weeks, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been expressing growing concern about Moscow's military activity on the Ukrainian border.""We don't know what President [Vladimir] Putin's intentions are, but we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said Saturday during a trip to Senegal, referring to Russian military incursions, acknowledged or not, into neighboring countries. ""We do know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and then using that as an excuse to do what Russia's planning to do all along.""The Kremlin has responded by accusing western countries of ""hysteria"" about Russia invading Ukraine.Strait jacketWith tensions high in the region, CNN joined the Ukrainian navy vessel departing from Berdyansk on Ukraine's Azov coastline. Usually, Commander Ovchar's crew comes across six or seven Russian coast guard patrol boats, he says, but on this mission, there were none.The sea he's patrolling borders Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow following a controversial referendum in 2014, in violation of international law.Since seizing Crimea, Russia has built a bridge linking it to its own territory. The Kerch Bridge over the Kerch Strait serves as the only direct connection between Russia and Crimea -- and gives Moscow de facto control of the sea's access to the Black Sea and Mediterranean beyond.But Ukraine has a plan to try to keep Moscow from taking complete control of the body of water that links Ukraine's two biggest ports, Berdyansk and Mariupol.Ukraine's new Defense Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced November 13 that the pace of building a new naval port in Berdyansk was to be increased. On Tuesday, CNN gained exclusive access to the ""Sehid"" or ""East"" base under construction.It was immediately clear that a lot of work still needed to be done for this base to be anywhere near completion.The aim was to complete the first phase of construction -- new living quarters, administrative buildings and a small medical facility on the site of a disused tin factory -- by the end of year. However, with less than six weeks to go, there was not even a roof on the main building.A special detachment of military builders toiled with masonry, slapping on cement and laying bricks, a Ukrainian flag billowing as they worked.The scale of the task at hand became even starker as we walked down onto the port, joined to a commercial port.""This will be the position of the docks,"" Capt. 2nd Class Alexander Serdiyk said, pointing to heaps of warped metal and boulders lying haphazardly in the sea. ""We plan to have this section completed in two years.""But Ukraine may not have two years to prepare for conflict.The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, Brigader General Kyrylo Budanov, told the US defense newspaper Military Times that Russia was increasing troop levels and weapons systems in Crimea for an offensive that could come at any time. The Kremlin has repeatedly said it has no plans to invade Ukraine. ""The American and Ukrainian media claim that Russia is preparing for an attack on Ukraine, and we are saying that Ukraine is planning hostilities against Donbas, against the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, said Tuesday. ""We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for an attempt to forcefully resolve the Donbas issue.""  Ukraine's allies have begun responding to what they see as a fresh threat from its neighbor to the east.On Monday, CNN reported that the Biden administration was weighing the possibility of sending military advisers and new equipment, including weaponry, to Ukraine. The package could include Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-armor missiles and mortars.The US is also considering sanctions with European allies if Russia invades Ukraine.Last week, British Defence Minister Ben Wallace visited Ukraine and signed an agreement to ""develop the capabilities of the naval forces of Ukraine."" CNN learned Tuesday that part of the deal will focus on Berdyansk.The same day, the Ukrainian navy announced the arrival of two ""Island-type"" boats named ""Fastiv"" and ""Sumy,"" delivered from Baltimore in the United States to Odessa in Ukraine.""Soon the boats will raise the Ukrainian navy flag and under the command of Ukrainian crews they will begin their combat journey to ensure maritime safety in the Black and Azov seas,"" Admiral Alexey Neizhpapa said.The bigger question is whether new Ukrainian ships and infrastructure, plus warnings from the West, will be enough of a deterrent.

41,"The former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism was sentenced on Tuesday to a total of 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering.Tony Chung, 20, was charged with secession, under a sweeping national security law, and money laundering in October 2020 and was denied bail. Local media reported at the time that he was detained along with two others at a coffee shop close to the United States consulate by unidentified men and was believed to be preparing for an asylum application.Chung had entered a plea bargain, admitting guilt on the charge of secession and one count of money laundering and pleading not guilty to a sedition charge and another money laundering accusation.The plea led to a 25% reduction in his sentence, to 40 months for secession and 18 months for money laundering. Only three months of the latter will be served separately, resulting in a total sentence of 43 months.""He actively organized, planned and implemented activities to separate the country,"" District Court Judge Stanley Chan said.Prosecutor Ivan Cheung has said the defendant acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the US branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party.Pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were also seized from his home, the prosecutor said. The money laundering charge was related to donations he received via PayPal.Like other anti-government organizations, Studentlocalism disbanded before Beijing imposed the security law in June 2020, to punish anything it deems as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The vast majority of Hong Kong people do not support independence, but any mention of the idea is anathema to Beijing.Since the enactment of the security law, Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn, with most democratic politicians now in jail or in self-exile. Dozens of civil society organizations have folded, and some international rights groups have left the city.Chinese and Hong Kong authorities deny the security law tramples individual rights and say the legislation was necessary to restore stability after mass street protests in 2019.The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise -- an allegation that Beijing vehemently denies.",2
42,"London (CNN)People in the United Kingdom think that climate change, pollution and the environment are together the most important issues they face, well ahead of the pandemic, the impacts of Brexit and the country's troubled National Health Service, according to a poll from Ipsos MORI published on Wednesday.The poll showed the highest level of concern about the climate crisis since the agency began polling in 1988. Ipsos MORI publishes its poll monthly, and November's was carried out over a week during the COP26 climate conference. The event was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and received extensive national media coverage. Around 40% of people surveyed said climate change, pollution and the environment were among their top three concerns. The pandemic came second at 27% and Brexit was third, with 22%. Ipsos MORI interviewed more than 1,000 adults, who answered spontaneously and were not prompted with options as answers. Climate concern was 16 percentage points higher in November than October, when people expressed greater concern about Brexit, the pandemic and the economy. While there was a clear bump in interest during the COP26 conference, there has been longterm growth in concern about climate over the past decade, which has been confirmed by other polls, including from YouGov. The Ipsos MORI poll showed was a fairly even distribution of climate concern across age groups, genders and political affiliation.""[It's] very encouraging that climate change is no longer a preoccupation reserved to the young and the liberal,"" Gabriela Jiga-Boy, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Swansea, told CNN. ""It means that British society may not be very divided regarding climate change. This is very important in these times, when we discuss a lot about real or false polarization on issues, and we often exaggerate how polarized people actually are.""Climate a top concern for older people, tooMen and women considered the climate crisis a top issue almost equally, at 40% and 41%, respectively, the poll showed. And supporters of the center-right Conservative Party and center-left Labour Party were equal in their concern for climate issues.In the age group of 55 and over, 47% of people said it was a top issue. For the 35 to 54 age group, it was 43%. Among those 18 to 34 years old, just 27% said the same, though that age group was less likely to say they were worried about any particular issue.Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said that climate change is now a top priority among a majority of groups because the topic is ""becoming personal."" That's also true for how policies like net-zero emissions targets may affect them.Dozens of countries have set a net-zero emissions goal for mid-century, for which they plan to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions and ""capture"" excess, through actions like planing trees or using technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels. Such technology isn't fully developed and remains controversial.  ""We are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change -- from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy,"" Hiteva told CNN in an email.While concern about the climate crisis is fairly even among age groups, support for different types of climate action is more divisive.""Older people are more inclined to pay for investment in infrastructure to improve the experience of future generations, while people between the age of 18-25 are significantly less inclined to pay more for improvements that they will not experience in their lifetime,"" she said, citing her own research on climate action.""The only way for this to translate into action is to use the momentum of the moment and engage people with re-imagining how infrastructure investment can be designed and used in an innovative way which is not only kinder to the environment but is also more inclusive and fairer.""",2
43,"A US warship again sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, part of what the US military calls routine activity but which always riles China whose government believes Washington is trying to stir regional tensions.The US Navy said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Milius conducted a ""routine Taiwan Strait transit"" through international waters in accordance with international law.""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows,"" it added.There was no immediate response from China.Last month, the Chinese military condemned the United States and Canada for each sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait, saying they were threatening peace and stability in the region.China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the past year or so, provoking anger in Taipei.The United States like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.Beijing calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with Washington.US Navy ships have been transiting the strait roughly monthly, to the anger of Beijing. US allies occasionally also send ships through the strait, including Britain in September.",2
44,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Paytm is starting to stage a recovery from its disastrous stock market debut last week, but the digital payments firm faces an uphill battle winning over investors worried about its ability to turn a profit in the face of growing competition. Shares of the Indian company — trading under the name of its parent, One97 Communications — plunged in the days since they began trading in Mumbai in the country's biggest IPO when measured in local currency.The stock edged higher on Tuesday, but it's still down more than 30% from its issue price, a loss of $5.7 billion in market value.Analysts expressed several concerns about Paytm in the run-up to its offering. The company lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year and seems far from ready to turn a profit. It's also up against growing competition from some of the biggest tech firms in the world. Companies such as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) are using an Indian government-backed technology called the Unified Payments Interface. ""Dabbling in multiple business lines inhibits Paytm from being a category leader in any business except wallets, which are becoming inconsequential with the meteoric rise in UPI payments,"" analysts at Macquarie wrote in a research note last week.""Most things that Paytm does, every other large ecosystem player like Amazon, Flipkart, Google, etc, are doing,"" the analysts added.Big questions remain about how Paytm can effectively profit off its massive customer base, according to Prashant Gokhale, chief operating officer at Aletheia Capital. Paytm said in its IPO filing that it had 337 million registered consumers and 22 million merchants. But Gokhale told CNN Business the problem is how the company can turn those consumers into revenue. ""They have a lot of subsidiaries. They have insurance, they have stock broking, they have financial services,"" Gokhale said, adding that the company wants to make money by selling those additional services to existing users of its payments app.But he said those businesses are all rife with competition, making it difficult to see how there's a pathway to profitability for Paytm.These kinds of IPOs ""remind a new generation of investors that there are risks,"" Gokhale added.Talking to CNN last week, Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma acknowledged his company's poor IPO performance, and said that if it had waited to announce a few more quarterly results, ""our execution plan would bring comfort to a lot more people.""Paytm ""is a new business model for many public market investors,"" he told CNN's Julia Chatterley, adding that numbers in subsequent quarters ""will explain this much better.""""I would say that it is very early days to say that we would not be profitable,"" Sharma added. ""Our numbers and revenues will do the job of talking.""— Diksha Madhok contributed to this report.",2
45,"New York (CNN Business)The Chinese economy presents some unique challenges for investors. On one hand, China is home to several of the most dynamic and rapidly growing companies on the planet, such as electric car makers Xpeng and Nio (NIO) as well as privately held TikTok owner ByteDance.But China's recent crackdown on the tech sector has slowed earnings momentum at big brand name firms including Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA) and WeChat owner Tencent (TCEHY). Continued human rights concerns, brought to the forefront once more following questions about the safety of tennis star Peng Shuai, are also a problem for some investors. So can (and should) you avoid the world's second largest economy? Some experts think that's exactly what investors should be doing.""Investors have underestimated autocracy risk,"" said Perth Tolle, sponsor of the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets (FRDM) ETF, a fund that has no exposure to Chinese stocks. ""You can't always factor in the risk of a government coming in overnight and saying to a company 'you can't really make a profit,'"" she said. Tolle told CNN Business that investors should be more concerned about capital flowing out of the country due to worries about Beijing exerting more control over companies in mainland China.That's why her fund has more exposure to other markets such as Taiwan and South Korea instead of China. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) are two top holdings in the FRDM ETF.Emerging markets funds doing better without China exposureTolle isn't the only one screening out China from emerging markets funds. Big fund companies such as iShares and Columbia Threadneedle also have emerging market ETFs that leave Chinese companies out of their holdings. The funds have outperformed broader emerging markets funds this year, too, showing that investing for social good can be profitable. The FRDM ETF, as well as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (EMXC) and Columbia EM Core ex-China ETF (XCEM), are each up between 6% and 8% in 2021. That's compared to a 2% drop for the broader iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which owns Tencent, Alibaba and Chinese food delivery service Meituan as top holdings. Other investing experts argue that Chinese president Xi Jinping's recent push to crack down on big tech firms is not a good sign for earnings in the short-term.""We like the longer-term view, but in the near- term, we're more cautious,"" said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. ""Some other emerging markets have better growth potential.""""The move from promoting more entrepreneurship to an equal growth sharing of the pie changes the equation,"" he added. ""We took some money off the table and reduced our exposure to China.""Another portfolio manager argued that trying to predict which companies or sectors will come under the ""Xi Jinping thought sphere of influence"" makes investing there a challenge. Major Chinese education stocks have taken a hit this year as well due to regulatory concerns. ""The investor perception of risk has risen in China, and it has risen with cause,"" said Paul Espinosa, portfolio manager with Seafarer Capital Partners.   Espinosa also said China isn't as attractive as other emerging markets simply because stocks outside of the country are better bargains. Companies in Brazil and others parts of Latin America are more compelling values than Chinese-based firms, Espinosa said. He's also looking at investment opportunities in the Middle East.""Everyone is so focused on China, and it is dominated by growth investors,"" he said. ""But there are more opportunities outside of China."" ",2
46,"The United Nations on Monday pushed for urgent action to prop up Afghanistan's banks, warning that a spike in people who are unable to repay loans as well as lower deposits and a cash liquidity crunch could cause the financial system to collapse within months.In a three-page report on Afghanistan's banking and financial system seen by Reuters, the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said the economic cost of a banking system collapse - and consequent negative social impact - ""would be colossal.""An abrupt withdrawal of most foreign development support after the Taliban seized power on Aug. 15 from Afghanistan's Western-backed government has sent the economy into freefall, putting a severe strain on the banking system which set weekly withdrawal limits to stop a run on deposits.""Afghanistan's financial and bank payment systems are in disarray. The bank-run problem must be resolved quickly to improve Afghanistan's limited production capacity and prevent the banking system from collapsing,"" the UNDP report said.Finding a way to avert a collapse is complicated by international and unilateral sanctions on Taliban leaders.""We need to find a way to make sure that if we support the banking sector, we are not supporting Taliban,"" Abdallah al Dardari, head of UNDP in Afghanistan, told Reuters.""We are in such a dire situation that we need to think of all possible options and we have to think outside the box,"" he said. ""What used to be three months ago unthinkable has to become thinkable now.""Afghanistan's banking system was already vulnerable before the Taliban came to power. But since then development aid has dried up, billions of dollars in Afghan assets have been frozen abroad, and the United Nations and aid groups are now struggling to get enough cash into the country.'Under the mattress'The UNDP's proposals to save the banking system include a deposit insurance scheme, measures to ensure adequate liquidity for short- and medium-term needs, as well as credit guarantees and loan repayment delay options.""Coordination with the International Financial Institutions, with their extensive experience of the Afghan financial system, would be critical to this process,"" UNDP said in its report, referring to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.The United Nations has repeatedly warned since the Taliban took over that Afghanistan's economy is on the brink of a collapse that would likely further fuel a refugee crisis. UNDP said that if the banking system fails, it could take decades to rebuild.The UNDP report said that with current trends and withdrawal restrictions, about 40% of Afghanistan's deposit base will be lost by the end of the year. It said banks have stopped extending new credit, and that non-performing loans had almost doubled to 57% in September from the end of 2020.""If this rate continues of non-performing loans, the banks may not have a chance to survive in the next six months. And I am being optimistic,"" al Dardari said.Liquidity has also been a problem. Afghan banks heavily relied on physical shipments of U.S. dollars, which have stopped. When it comes to the local afghani currency, al Dardari said that while there is about $4 billion worth of afghanis in the economy, only about $500 million worth is in circulation.""The rest is sitting under the mattress or under the pillow because people are afraid,"" he said.As the United Nations seeks to avert famine in Afghanistan, al Dardari also warned about the consequences of a banking collapse for trade finance.""Afghanistan last year imported about $7 billion worth of goods and products and services, mostly foodstuff ... If there is no trade finance the interruption is huge,"" he said. ""Without the banking system, none of this can happen."" ",2
47," (CNN)Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Jenifer Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door.It wasn't until after college, when she moved to India for a job in information technology, that she appreciated the vast social inequalities people endure.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said, which is why she changed her career path. She returned to Colombia, settled in Cartagena and volunteered with community organizations that helped people living in poverty. ""I felt very saddened to see that people were living without the most basic things,"" she said. ""People don't have clean drinking water, indoor plumbing, electricity.""She wanted to do more to help bring these essentials to communities most in need. In 2015, with the help of friends, Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata. Today, the non-profit provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. ""We didn't know anything at first, but we had all the determination,"" Colpas said.Colpas, now 31, and her team of other young like-minded counterparts currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people. CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Colpas about her efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversationCNN: Who does your organization help?Jenifer Colpas: The communities where we are working, they are very diverse. You can find indigenous people, farmers, and most of the places where we are working now, they are a displaced population.Over 50 years of war have made Colombia the country with the highest internal-displaced population in the world.  These rural communities were taken over by the FARC and other paramilitary groups. Because of all the years that those communities were in a conflict zone, they were totally forgotten. They have been invisible to the government and for a lot of Colombians. They are the hardest to reach and less likely to have access to any basic service. These areas are so remote that there are no roads to get there. Nobody goes there. But we are going there to provide access to basic services. CNN: Why was it especially important for you and your team to put local women in leadership positions to assist with the projects? Colpas: We are working with women because, for us, it's very important to empower them and to re-signify their role inside the community. So they will be not just social leaders, but also problem-solvers.The leaders have different roles. One is that they are our main partners within the community. They are the first contact in case there is something we need to fix. If something happens with any of the families, they are our main contact. They are the ones that are working on the solutions in the long term. They help us to organize logistics before any installation. They help us understand how to reach the community, which is the best way we can organize the team to go there and to do the installation process. So, we train them and share our knowledge.CNN: What are you providing these communities on a deeper level?Colpas: We're covering their basic needs so they can start dreaming. My biggest dream for them is that they can wake up not just to survive, but they can make a step further and start fulfilling their dreams. Their stories, their inner power to go ahead even in a really bad situation, through all they are suffering, is what inspires me. They are very resilient. Every time I talk with them, they really motivate me, inspire me to go further. Because despite all the problems they face, they never give up. Want to get involved?

CNN Heroes has been spotlighting the impactful work of people across the world since 2007. Here's a look at this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes:Jenifer Colpas: Bringing clean water and power to rural villages in her countryHer cause: Jenifer Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata in 2015, a non-profit that provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. Colpas and her team currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people.What inspired her: Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door. After college, she moved to India for a job in information technology. There, she became aware of vast social inequalities.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said. She decided to change her career path and return home, where she co-founded Tierra Grata, which means ""gratitude to the earth"" in Spanish.Read more about Jenifer Colpas and her workLynda Doughty: The seal rescuerHer cause:  For the past decade, Lynda Doughty's nonprofit, Marine Mammals of Maine, has provided response efforts, assistance and medical care for more than 3,000 marine animals.The group monitors 2,500 miles of coastline and operates a 24-hour hotline, responding to calls about distressed or deceased marine mammals, and it has federal authorization to provide temporary care for critically ill and injured seals. Data gathered on these animals allows Doughty and her team to monitor trends in diseases and human impact on marine mammal health.What inspired her:  Growing up in coastal Maine, Doughty developed a passion for the marine wildlife living along the coast and knew from an early age that she wanted to dedicate her life to protecting them.""I just remember being so amazed (by them) and wondering what's happening in their life,"" Doughty said.She also became aware that their livelihood was jeopardized by pollution, habitat destruction and other human-related activity.""I knew that I wanted to do something to help these animals,"" Doughty said.She became a marine biologist and worked for several years with organizations that provided emergency response and rehabilitation for sick and injured marine mammals. But as nonprofits and state agencies lost funding or closed their doors, Doughty decided to step in and fill the gap.Read more about Lynda Doughty and her workDavid Flink: Creating a new way to learnHis cause:  David Flink's Eye to Eye program pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference. Eye to Eye's 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school.What inspired him: Growing up, Flink had a hard time focusing in school, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. With the support of his parents and the right school, Flink graduated high school and went to Brown University.When he got to college, he found a community of students who also had learning differences. Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability.Read more about David Flink and his workDr. Patricia Gordon: Saving women from a preventable diseaseHer cause: Dr. Patricia Gordon operates CureCervicalCancer, which delivers screening, training and supplies to clinics around the world. The organization has since worked in 10 countries, including China, Haiti, Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Vietnam.The non-profit has screened more than 150,000 women and treated more than 8,600 to date. It has also established 106 sustainable clinics to screen and treat women in remote and underserved areas.""That there are 8,000 women who are alive and well and able to provide for their families is honestly the most rewarding thing that I could have ever imagined in my life,"" Gordon said. ""I think I'm the luckiest doctor that ever lived.""What inspired her: Gordon, a radiation oncologist, traveled with a group of doctors in 2012 to bring a new radiation device to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. While there, she saw how many women were needlessly being killed by a preventable, treatable disease: cervical cancer.""There are 350,000 women dying a painful, undignified death globally. And it's almost 100% preventable,"" she said.The team arranged to provide cervical cancer screenings for women in a remote and hard-hit area of Senegal. Using a method Gordon and others call ""See & Treat,"" screening can be done without needing electricity and with a few transportable supplies.It was a far cry from the way things operated in her Beverly Hills office, but the experience stayed with Gordon, whose own family history of breast cancer is a driving force in her work.After 27 years, Gordon left her private practice in 2014 to devote all her time to CureCervicalCancer. She takes no salary.Read more about Dr. Patricia Gordon and her workHector Guadalupe: Giving former prisoners a second chanceHis cause: Hector Guadalupe's non-profit, A Second U Foundation, helps formerly incarcerated men and women get certified as personal trainers and build careers in the fitness industry so they can support their families. Guadalupe and his team of volunteers offer a free eight-week program for 10-15 students every quarter to prepare for the national certification exam.In addition to study materials and exam fees, the program now also provides each student a free tablet with keyboard, transportation, new clothing, software classes and a $1,300 stipend. Coaches also mentor students, helping with far more than classwork.Once students have passed the exam, Guadalupe helps them get jobs. More than 200 people have graduated from the program since 2016 and only two have reoffended -- a recidivism rate of less than 1%.  What inspired him: By the time he was a teenager, Guadalupe had lost both parents and ended up spending 10 years in prison for drug trafficking. There he became obsessed with fitness and got certified as a personal trainer. When he came home, he was determined to work at one of Manhattan's elite gyms.""Six days out of the week, I'm literally at every corporate health club ... filling out applications,"" Guadalupe said. ""Nobody was calling me back ... and I knew why: because of my past ... But I didn't give up.""After nine months, he landed an opportunity and worked without a day off for four years to establish himself in New York's fitness scene. Now, he devotes much of his week to helping others do the same.Read more about Hector Guadalupe and his workMichele Neff Hernandez: Finding a way through grief togetherHer cause: Michele Neff Hernandez created Soaring Spirits in 2008, three years after her husband's death. Her nonprofit connects widows and widowers, allowing them to heal in a community that understands the pain of losing a partner. It has grown to include 70 regional chapters all over the US, as well as pen pals and programs specifically for the LGBTQ community.To date, the organization has reached more than 4 million people worldwide.""It's about helping widowed people live life in community with each other, so that someone who has borne witness to their pain also bears witness to their life as they continue making their way forward,"" Neff Hernandez said.What inspired her: Hernandez and her husband, Phillip, were enjoying the active life they built as a couple. But everything changed in August 2005 when Phillip went for a bike ride and was hit by a car and killed.""I didn't even know what to do with myself,"" Neff Hernandez said. ""Every single thing about my life changed.""While she had a great support system, none of their friends and family knew how to handle her grief.Hernandez realized she wanted to connect with other widows to learn how they dealt with their new reality.""I thought if I could bring these widows together, what a difference that would make,"" she said.Read more about Michelle Neff Hernandez and her workZannah Mustapha: Building a strong and peaceful future generation His cause: For more than a decade, Zannah Mustapha has devoted his life to providing hope and peace for children in northern Nigeria caught in the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. He and his staff educate more than 2,000 students from both sides of the conflict at the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School.The school offers psychological and social support to help children with trauma. Students, who all live nearby with relatives or family members, are also provided uniforms, books, meals and health services.Mustapha said 1,023 students have graduated, and many have gone on to college or careers.""These are children (who are) ravaged by the disturbances that Boko Haram has brought in,"" he said. ""Children ... are not even having this war.""What inspired him: Mustapha said he believes the way to achieve true and lasting peace in the devastated region is through education, and he has defied all odds to keep the doors to his three schools open.He started the program in 2007 with 36 orphans and expanded, even as others fled the region. As Mustapha continued to expand to meet the needs of children, he saw more and more women struggling when their husbands were killed in the conflict. So, he developed a program in which women could learn a trade to help support their families.A peace leader, Mustapha envisions a Nigeria where there is no more violence, where education and acceptance are encouraged for all.""(When I) see the faces of these children and how these children are dreaming, it gives me the hope that still there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""Read more about Zannah Mustapha and his workShirley Raines: Beauty 2 the StreetzHer cause:  For the past six years, Raines and her organization, Beauty 2 the Streetz, have been a mainstay on Los Angeles' Skid Row, providing food, clothing, hair and makeup services -- and most recently health and hygiene items -- to thousands of people.Rain or shine, she sets up ""shop"" weekly at the corner of 5th and Townes to serve those she calls ""Kings"" and ""Queens."" Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to downtown LA to feed and bring supplies to people.What inspired her: Raines' 2-year-old son Demetrius was staying with her grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized.He died on Sept. 6, 1990, just shy of his third birthday.""I blamed myself for not having stability. If only I'd had my own backyard. If only I'd had my stuff together,"" Raines said.  Soon after, Raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son's biological father to cancer.""I just fell apart. I lived a very unhappy life. I couldn't keep anything together,"" she said.After struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades, Raines' twin sister stepped in, urging her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,'"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Read more about Shirley Raines and her workDr. Ala Stanford: Bringing Covid-19 testing and vaccines to Philly's minority neighborhoodsHer cause: Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods.Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing.In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour ""Vax-A-Thon"" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people.The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers.What inspired her:  Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, Stanford's family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep her from dreaming big.""I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it,"" she said. ""That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what.""She became a pediatric surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.She was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia as a result of Covid-19. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent White areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.So, she gathered up protective supplies from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.""The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started,"" she said.Read more about Dr. Ala Stanford and her workMade Janur Yasa: A plastic clean-up program that's feeding familiesHis cause: Made Janur Yasa's non-profit, Plastic Exchange, allows local villagers in Bali, Indonesia, to exchange plastic trash for rice, a main food staple. This barter system benefits the environment and empowers the local people.  In May 2020, he hosted the first exchange in the village where he was born and raised. It was a success, and the concept quickly spread to other villages across Bali.Villages hold community exchange events once a month in which residents can bring in plastic to trade in for rice. Yasa says the organization has so far helped feed thousands of families and collected nearly 300 tons of plastic for recycling.What inspired him: Yasa owns a vegan restaurant on Indonesia's island of Bali, where tourism is the driving economic force. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many residents lost their jobs.""I saw people in my village start worrying about how they were going to put food on the table,"" he said. ""This concerned me.""Yasa said he wanted to find a way to help people in his community during the pandemic while also addressing the ongoing problem of plastic pollution on Bali's beaches.""I got to thinking, inside the challenge there is an opportunity,"" he said.Read more about Made Janur Yasa and his work",2
49," (CNN)Elijah Lewis, a 5-year-old found dead in a Massachusetts state park after being missing for more than a month, died by homicide, officials said Monday. An autopsy found the boy's cause of death ""was determined to be violence and neglect, including facial and scalp injuries, acute fentanyl intoxication, malnourishment and pressure ulcers,"" the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office said in a news release.Elijah's remains were found by state police on October 23 in Ames Nowell State Park in Abington, about 20 miles southeast of Boston. His body was discovered in what investigators referred to as a grave, the attorney general's office said at the time.Elijah's disappearance was brought to the attention of authorities by New Hampshire's Division for Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) on October 14. He wasn't reported missing prior to this time, officials said.Police in Merrimack, New Hampshire, began investigating and were joined by New Hampshire State Police and the New Hampshire Department of Justice, according to the attorney general's office. New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell told CNN affiliate WMUR last month that investigators believe they narrowed down the time frame Elijah went missing back to September 1.Elijah's mother, Danielle Dauphinais, 35, and her boyfriend, Joseph Stapf, 30, were arrested on charges of child endangerment and witness tampering on October 17 and are being held without bond, the attorney general's office said.Witness tampering charges against Dauphinais and Stapf stem from evidence showing the pair allegedly asked people to lie about Elijah's whereabouts and where he was living, knowing child protection services were searching for the boy, the attorney general said in an October statement.CNN has reached out to the attorneys for Dauphinais and Stapf for comment but did not immediately hear back.",2
50," (CNN)There is a common thread between the 1995 acquittal of O.J. Simpson and the 2021 acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse -- a jury and trial consultant named Jo-Ellan Dimitrius.She developed the jury profile in Simpson's case and now, decades later, worked ""hand in hand"" with Rittenhouse's attorneys to help build a profile for the ""right"" juror in his case.""In O.J.'s case because we had done so much pretrial research, we knew that there was a certain demographic that was going to be more open to what our defense was,"" she told CNN.At the time, it was a female African American with a high school education or less, she recalled. In Rittenhouse's case, however, she said, ""We didn't find anything that was predictive.""So, they dug. ""Familiarity with guns was an important thing to explore,"" she told CNN. ""Generally getting a sense if somebody was a supporter of the Second Amendment, supporter of the First Amendment as well."" That included both in real life and from their ""digital footprints"" on social media.""In looking at profiles of jurors, it's looking for individuals who are going to be most receptive to whatever the evidence is that comes out,"" she added.Ahead of the trial, Dimitrius and the Rittenhouse team tested that in the form of three sets of mock jurors.The defense knew video would be paramount, but a central question quickly became whether Rittenhouse would actually testify. ""There were concerns by everyone involved in the case,"" according to Dimitrius, especially given his age and the attention on his every move.""We had three separate groups of twelve mock jurors. One of them saw only the video testimony and the other two saw not only the video testimony but they saw Kyle actually testify,"" said Dimitrius. ""As a result of that it was very, very clear that his story needed to be told about what happened that night.""Mark Richards, defense attorney for Rittenhouse, told CNN, ""He scored much worse [with those who did not hear his story] than the people who did hear his story.""""That was subject to cross examination by a trained ex-prosecutor. And that made the decision, I don't want to say easy, but it made it the right call...he needs to tell his story,"" he added.On November 10, Rittenhouse eventually took the stand in his own defense, at times emotional, describing how August 25, 2020, ended with him killing two people and wounding a third.  According to Dimitrius, the ""perfect juror"" in the Rittenhouse case was someone who was willing ""to listen to what was presented in court and to make their decision based solely on that evidence.""""The rest is history,"" she said.'Very frustrating' jury selection processOut of the 179 prospective jurors who arrived for the Rittenhouse trial, the final 20 needed for trial were whittled down in a day.""Judge (Bruce) Schroeder did not allow us the use of a written questionnaire, juror questionnaire, which is highly unusual in a high-profile case,"" Dimitrius told CNN. ""Number two, he limited the voir dire to an hour apiece...generally to get in the questions you want to ask, that's a very, very short period of time.""The jurors were sorted dozens at a time, and the pace made it difficult at times to keep up with what was actually in play.""It was very frustrating,"" Dimitrius said.She was hired months ahead of the trial and was present during jury selection, jury monitoring, and trial assistance and was often seen sitting next to Wendy Rittenhouse, the defendant's mother.The jurors in the Rittenhouse trial were overwhelmingly White not only in the original pool of 179 prospects but also in the final deciding panel of 12, where there was only one person of color.""It should be reflective of the community in which the trial will be held,"" Dimitrius told CNN. ""I saw the demographic representation very accurate to what Kenosha has.""As of 2019, about 79 percent of Kenosha's population was white, according to the US Census.""I do believe in my heart of hearts that we ended up with a jury that would be very fair,"" Dimitrius said.Rittenhouse faced homicide and reckless endangerment charges for the killings of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, and for shooting at the man commonly known in court as ""jump kick man."" The shootings happened after the police shooting of Jacob Blake sparked protests in Kenosha.During their deliberations, jurors requested to rewatch much of the video evidence of the shootings. In the end, they agreed with Rittenhouse's testimony that he feared for his life and acted in self-defense. He was acquitted of all charges on November 19.After the verdict, lead prosecutor Thomas Binger told the court, ""The jury has represented our community in this trial and has spoken.""Binger, in a statement, said, ""While we are disappointed with the verdict, it must be respected."" The judge praised the jurors, saying he ""couldn't have asked for a better jury.""  Rittenhouse vs. SimpsonThere are undoubtedly many differences between the 1995 OJ Simpson and the 2021 Kyle Rittenhouse murder trials, mainly, as Dimitrius put it, ""back in '95 people remember hopefully that the Internet wasn't front and center.""Another key difference, according to Dimitrius, was the lack of any demographic that was necessarily ""predictive"" in the Rittenhouse case like there was for Simpson.""We learned that African American women with a high school or less education, for whatever reason, they didn't believe that the next step from domestic abuse or domestic violence was necessarily murder,"" she told CNN. ""I couldn't explain it then, I can't explain it now, but for whatever reason they were the ones that were most, sort of open to that component.""At least half of the 12 jurors in the Simpson trial were Black women.That jury eventually acquitted Simpson of charges in the killing of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.The case was dubbed the ""trial of the century"" for its swirling themes of celebrity, race, criminal justice, trust in police and domestic violence. After nearly nine months of proceedings, jurors returned their not guilty verdict in less than four hours.Simpson was later found liable in a civil wrongful death lawsuit brought by the victims' families. On the stand, he denied killing Brown Simpson and Goldman. Dimitrius said one of the key similarities between the trials was the dynamic around the two being televised, including receiving ""important information because people were watching what was going on, on TV and then they may have known somebody, they may have felt compelled to come in to testify.""According to Dimitrius, that included Drew Hernandez as ""one of those people who reached out to us after he saw Richie McGinniss testify. The same thing happened in O.J."" Hernandez was a freelance commentator who was the 10th witness called by the defense during testimony.Hernandez, who shot video of the protests, testified that Rittenhouse tried to deescalate tensions at one point the night of the shooting. He told the jury that Rosenbaum -- the first person to be shot -- was ""physically aggressive"" even before his encounter with Rittenhouse. While jury selection is important in a trial, Dimitrius emphasized, ""I don't change the evidence,"" as she admitted she is not always right and views her position as ""supplemental to a good trial lawyer's experience.""Over her decades long career, she has been involved in many high-profile cases on both the criminal and civil side, including the estate of George Floyd's civil case with the City of Minneapolis, one that ended as one of the largest pretrial settlements in history. Many of the cases she has been involved with are polarizing in nature from Rodney King to Francis Ford Coppola, Kobe Bryant, and more.""What I've seen, particularly in OJ and in Kyle's case, is that sadly there are certain bodies of the public that find it an inconvenient truth if in fact there is an acquittal. And who those people are from trial to trial, issue to issue, is different,"" Dimitrius told CNN.She hopes the public learns from the results of Rittenhouse trial. ""Whether it's Kenosha, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, wherever. I believe everybody has that First Amendment right as well, to protest and let their opinion be known but where it crosses the line is where there's either destruction of property or destruction of life,"" she added.""I hope that there is something learned from these types of cases and that we can move forward as a country and still exercise those constitutional rights we have but also accept the responsibility when they step over the line.""",2
51," (CNN)Criminal charges against a St. Louis County police officer who shot a Black woman were dropped Monday after the victim requested a restorative justice mediation that focuses on repairing the harm caused by an offense. The St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office said Ashley Fountain Hall asked that assault charges be dropped against former Ladue, Missouri, police officer Julia Crews, 39. The charges stemmed from a dispute that took place on April 23, 2019, outside a Schnucks grocery store.   Crews mistakenly drew her firearm instead of using her Taser to restrain Hall and shot her in the torso, leading to critical injuries, the office said. Hall lost part of her spleen and suffers with post-traumatic stress disorder, prosecutors said.   The prosecutor's office said Crews immediately realized she drew her gun when she intended to use her Taser, then administered aid and apologized ""profusely."" Crews, who was captured crying in her booking photo, immediately resigned, and her response to the shooting ""all played a part in the push for mediation,"" the office said.  Hall, who has since recovered, received a $2 million settlement and pushed for a restorative justice program.  The prosecutor's office said Hall and Crews voluntarily participated in a ""successful"" face-to-face meeting with a mediator, Seema Gajwani, the chief of the Restorative Justice Program for Karl Racine, Attorney General for the District of Columbia.  St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell and Lisa Jones, the office's manager of Victim Services, also participated in the process. The method allows an offender to find rehabilitation through reconciliation with the victim.  ""This was a unique opportunity where the defendant immediately realized she had made a terrible mistake in shooting the victim, and both the defendant and victim reached places where they could see a resolution for this incident outside of the criminal justice process,"" said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell. ""In this instance, justice is served by Restorative Justice, and this doesn't happen without Ashley being 100% onboard.""  According to a 2002 United Nations resolution, restorative justice is a ""process in which the victim and the offender, and, where appropriate, any other individuals or community members affected by a crime, participate together actively in the resolution of matters arising from the crime, generally with the help of a facilitator.""   ""Too often, the criminal justice system gets in the way of resolution and healing, even though that is what these two women wanted and needed. Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell made it possible by offering Restorative Justice,"" said Gajwani. ""Ashley and Julia have the biggest hearts of anyone I have ever met. It was an honor to be a part of that conversation.""  ",2
52," (CNN)Three days after a gunshot set off a panic inside the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, police are still looking for the man they say brought the weapon through a security checkpoint and then managed to slip away in the ensuing chaos, firearm in hand. Kenny Wells, 42, is wanted on warrants accusing him of carrying a concealed weapon at a commercial airport, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, discharging a firearm and reckless conduct, Atlanta Police Department Airport Precinct Commander Reginald L. Moorman said Saturday.""We are actively pursuing this individual,"" Moorman added.Here's what we know about the incident that briefly grounded flights at one of the world's busiest airports:Discharged weapon sent holiday travelers scrambling for coverThe incident unfolded around 1:30 p.m., as holiday travelers were winding their way through lines at the airport's main security checkpoint, according to Robert Spinden, the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) federal security director for Georgia. A passenger's property was flagged for a ""secondary search"" after an X-ray screening detected a ""prohibited item,"" Spinden said during a news conference Saturday.""During that secondary search, the passenger lunged into his property, grabbing a firearm that was located inside, which ultimately discharged,"" Spinden said. ""The passenger then fled the security checkpoint through an adjacent exit lane with his firearm.""The incident left three people with non-life-threatening injuries, TSA officials said. A source familiar with the matter told CNN those injured were not shot; they were hurt while the airport was evacuated. The firearm was discharged into the property of the person who brought the weapon, the source said.All the injured were adults, two of whom were taken to the hospital, according to the source.""We're fortunate that when the firearm went off, nobody was seriously injured,"" Spinden said.Witnesses describe panicAirport spokesperson Andrew Gobeil characterized the discharge as accidental, adding the loud noise created a ""sense of chaos."" That chaos was captured in videos recorded by witnesses who describe terrified passengers running for safety, fearing a possible active shooter situation.In one video posted by Stephoń Stafford, line dividers are knocked down as people are lying on the ground in an apparent attempt to seek cover as someone is heard shouting, ""Get down."" Stafford said he was about to go through security with his child.Another video shared on Twitter by Haşmet Asilkan from outside the airport shows many people running in a frenzy as someone is heard urging people to run.Erika Zeidler, who was traveling from Atlanta to Anchorage, Alaska, said she was sitting in a restaurant in Concourse T when people began running down the hallway.""We thought they were late for a flight, and then more and more people started running,"" she told CNN's Jim Acosta. ""There was some screaming and then somebody stopped and said, 'There's a shooter, you need to go.'""Dianne Callahan was traveling with her son and had boarded her flight to New York. She said she heard screams outside of the plane when the crew closed the door. She also heard sirens, Callahan said, and didn't know what was going on.""It was an extremely tense situation,"" she said. ""People were pushing to get on the plane that were not even on our flight. That's how scared they were.""Callahan and her son were then sent to go back through security, she said.Guns pose a 'huge problem' for TSAIt is illegal for people to take firearms through security checkpoints at airports in the US, according to Page Pate, a Georgia criminal defense attorney and constitutional lawyer.According to TSA Administrator David Pekoske, the number of passengers bringing guns to airports has become a ""huge problem.""TSA reports catching 4,650 firearms at checkpoints in the first 10 months of the year -- and the vast majority were loaded. That number surpasses the full-year record of 4,432, set in 2019.At the Atlanta airport, 450 firearms have been detected at checkpoints so far this year, the TSA said Saturday.""We've had many more incidences where there are passenger disturbances both in checkpoints and onboard aircraft. That makes it more important that there are no guns involved,"" Pekoske said in an interview.",2
53," (CNN)New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not happy with her party.She made that abundantly clear in an interview with The New York Times over the weekend, suggesting that the passage of the infrastructure bill and the House approval of President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" measure are simply not enough to deliver on the expectations voters have for her party. And she also aptly diagnosed much of her party's current political problems.""Democrats have a trifecta and have been unable to pass voting-rights protections,"" said Ocasio-Cortez. ""And so people can wring their hands and say 'but Manchin' all they want, or 'but the filibuster' all they want, but at the end of the day, what people see are the results of their actions and the results of investing their time.""I think that's exactly right.The average voter likely knows one thing about our current politics: Democrats are in control of the White House, the Senate and the House. They are far less familiar with the narrowness of the Democratic majorities in those two chambers. Or with the filibuster rules that prevent any legislation from moving forward without 60 votes.That's not for a lack of trying by Biden, of course. He explicitly made the point about the narrowness of Democrats' margin in the Senate during a CNN townhall late last month. ""When you're in the United States Senate and you're President of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, every one is a president,"" Biden said to laughter. ""Every single one.""The reality, however, is closer to AOC's view. In voters' minds, they handed Democrats the keys to the kingdom, and they haven't been terribly happy with the results.Almost 6 in 10 Americans said that Biden wasn't focused enough on the nation's biggest problems, according to a CNN poll released earlier this month. That same poll showed that among those who believe the economy is the most important issue facing the country, almost 3 in 4 are not happy with the amount of attention that Biden has paid to it.While there is some broad agreement on the problem facing Democrats, the party diverges broadly on the solution.The view of most establishment Democrats -- including Biden and his White House -- is that they need to focus more on selling all that they have done to voters. ""I think the White House should do 25 presidential events in the next couple months just on infrastructure,"" said Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of House Democrats' campaign arm, earlier this month. ""And we should do 1,000 congressional events alongside those presidential events.""That is not the view of Ocasio-Cortez, however. Her belief is not that Democrats haven't sold their accomplishments well enough but rather that the party has been too timid to push the envelope legislatively in ways that get the party's base excited and engaged.""I think that if we pass the Build Back Better Act as the House passed it, that we have a shot to go back to our communities and say we delivered,"" said AOC. ""But that's not to say that this process has not been demoralizing for a lot of folks, because there were enormous promises made. Not just at the beginning, and not just during the election, but that continued to be made. And this is where I have sounded the alarm, because what really dampens turnout is when Democrats make promises that they don't keep.""If Ocasio-Cortez is right, the next few weeks/months hold little good for Democrats. The ""Build Back Better"" legislation is certain to be pared down in the Senate by the demands of moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona (among others). And then it will be sent back to the House for, effectively, a rubber stamp of approval -- a move that seems certain to further alienate AOC and her liberal colleagues from the process.Add it up and you get nothing good for Democrats as they try to find their footing ahead of the midterm battle for control of Congress.",2
54,"Washington (CNN)Democrat Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2018 and the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, announced last week that he is running for Texas governor in 2022.Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who announced Tuesday that he had filed to run for reelection, started attacking O'Rourke as radical and out of touch even before O'Rourke made his gubernatorial candidacy official. In a 30-second video ad released online in late October, Abbott's campaign drew attention to comments O'Rourke made on a podcast in June 2020 on the subject of the ""defund the police"" movement. Or, rather, Abbott's campaign drew attention to an altered version of O'Rourke's comments. Facts First: In three important ways, the Abbott ad deceptively edited O'Rourke's words about policing to try to make him sound more extreme. The ad's first deceptive edit deleted key O'Rourke words to make it sound like he had issued a broad, unreserved endorsement of Black Lives Matter activists for bringing attention to the idea of defunding the police. O'Rourke's actual words were narrower: he praised the activists for bringing attention to the idea of defunding ""line items that have overmilitarized our police.""The second deceptive edit deleted key words to make it sound like O'Rourke had called for ""dismantling"" police departments, end of story. He had actually called for dismantling ""and rebuilding"" departments in ""some necessary cases.""The third deceptive edit was especially egregious. This one mashed together phrases from three different O'Rourke sentences. The stitch job made it sound like an O'Rourke comment about the importance of Black Lives Matter activism, and how it is part of a tradition of civil rights activism, was a comment about the importance of defunding the police and dismantling police departments.  For emotional effect, the ad juxtaposed O'Rourke's altered words with a series of video clips of rioting and looting.The Abbott campaign's edits are extra notable because O'Rourke's actual, unedited comments in the June 2020 interview gave Republicans ample attack ammunition. Other O'Rourke opponents have highlighted his words about policing without altering them. Among other comments on policing, O'Rourke praised the city council of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for a decision that month to move toward dismantling the local police department and replacing it with a ""Department of Community Safety."" (Minneapolis voters rejected this idea when it was on the ballot earlier this month.) And because there is no single agreed-upon definition of what counts as ""defunding the police,"" Abbott could have tried to make an argument that O'Rourke's positive words about the notion of defunding certain police ""line items"" is evidence that he had supported the ""defund"" movement.But the Abbott ad did not include O'Rourke's comments about Minneapolis. And on police defunding, the ad sliced and diced O'Rourke's words instead of letting Texans evaluate them for themselves.Abbott campaign spokesman Mark Miner declined on Monday to directly address CNN's questions about the distortions in the ad, which the campaign promoted on Twitter last week. Miner said only: ""Beto O'Rourke clearly supports dismantling and defunding the police and he will need to explain his anti-law enforcement policies to the people of Texas.""O'Rourke campaign spokesman Joe Bowen said on Monday, ""Beto does not support defunding the police."" According to Texas Tribune political correspondent Patrick Svitek, O'Rourke told reporters last Wednesday, ""I don't think I've ever advocated for defunding the police.""We'll look at O'Rourke's position a little later. First let's walk through how the Abbott ad crafted its deception.The ad deleted essential wordsAfter showing clips of masked protesters, smoke on a street and a car on fire, the Abbott ad shows O'Rourke on camera saying: ""I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund..."" Then the screen cuts to a stylized shot of a man's moving mouth as O'Rourke's voice says, ""Completely dismantling those police forces.""But this is not a sentence O'Rourke actually uttered. In fact, the ad deleted two sets of important words, then strung the remaining words together to alter their meaning.Here's what O'Rourke said. The bolded words are the ones that the ad left out.""So I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund, you know, these line items that have overmilitarized our police, and instead invest that money in the human capital of your community, make sure that you have the services, the help, the support, the health care necessary to be well and not require police intervention. And then also in some necessary cases, completely dismantling those police forces and rebuilding them."" The ad moved a key phrase from one sentence to anotherThe end of the ad features O'Rourke's voice -- over video clips of rioting and looting -- saying this: ""Defund, dismantling police forces, it's the only way that things get better.""But that is not a sentence O'Rourke uttered either.So where did the supposed quote come from? The Abbott campaign was unwilling to explain, but it appears that the campaign took three separate O'Rourke remarks from the June 2020 interview and stitched them together as if they were one.O'Rourke made his comment about defunding certain police line items around the 34:46 mark of the podcast. About 30 seconds after that, he made his comment in favor of dismantling certain police forces and rebuilding them. It wasn't until more than a minute after that -- a full minute and a half from the ""defund"" comment -- that he uttered the words ""it's the only way that things get better."" And the context for these words was much different than the ad suggested. Here's the real context.O'Rourke praised the Minneapolis decision to move toward dismantling and replacing the police department, saying the only solution for such a problem-plagued department is ""completely dismantling that system and rebuilding it intentionally with the community members at the table."" He said that this notion might seem dangerous to some people but that ""any major change"" in US history has seemed dangerous to some. He noted that the activism of civil rights movement icon John Lewis and fellow Freedom Riders was dangerous to the status quo. Then O'Rourke said: ""So let's look at Black Lives Matter in that same context and from that same perspective. What they are doing right now is a very proud and necessary tradition of civil rights, and it's the only way that things get better.""The Abbott ad seems to have moved this quote -- ""it's the only way that things get better"" -- to an entirely different sentence with an entirely different meaning.O'Rourke's current positionWhen CNN asked O'Rourke's campaign on Monday for his current position on defunding the police, spokesman Bowen said he does not support it and never has. Again, O'Rourke himself said Wednesday, ""I don't think I've ever advocated for defunding the police.""Because of the haziness of the phrase ""defunding the police,"" O'Rourke's comments in the 2020 interview leave an opening for people to argue either way. Defenders of his position can accurately note that he didn't make a general call for all kinds of police funding to be removed. Opponents can accurately note that he spoke positively of taking away certain police funding and of dismantling (and rebuilding) some police departments.Bowen said that O'Rourke believes that police departments in Texas are now solving a lower percentage of violent crimes than they did when Abbott took office in 2015 because the departments are overburdened ""with responsibilities that may not require a law enforcement response."" ""We should allow other departments and community supports to respond to those challenges in order to allow police forces to focus on their most important job for public safety: addressing violent crime,"" Bowen said. O'Rourke said Wednesday, in the comments reported by Svitek of the Texas Tribune, that he doesn't want law enforcement to have to deal with ""issues where it's more of a mental health care challenge and incident that could be addressed with a social worker or someone who's not in law enforcement.""CNN asked Bowen if O'Rourke believes that some money should be taken away from police budgets and reallocated to these ""other departments"" that would handle the work O'Rourke thinks should be taken away from the police. Bowen said, ""That's a false choice. We cannot guarantee the safety of our communities focusing on one or the other, we must do both. We must invest in these additional services so that police departments can focus their resources on preventing and solving crime.""",2
55," (CNN)The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection issued five new subpoenas on Tuesday targeting right-wing extremist groups that were involved in the attack, including the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.The subpoenas went to the Proud Boys and its leader Enrique Tarrio, as well as the Oath Keepers and its leader Stewart Rhodes. Dozens of members of both groups have been charged in the attack on the US Capitol, and prosecutors have said they conspired ahead of time to disrupt the Electoral College proceedings. (Tarrio and Rhodes have not been charged.)The panel also subpoenaed Robert Patrick Lewis, chairman of 1st Amendment Praetorian, a group that the committee says provided security at ""multiple rallies leading up to January 6.""""We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the committee, said in a statement.Several dozen subpoenas have already been issued as part of the investigation, with mixed success. Investigators say they've spoken to more than 200 witnesses, but some key players from former President Donald Trump's world have stonewalled the probe and refused to testify or produce documents.Right-wing extremists played a major role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Leaders of the Proud Boys were involved in some of the early clashes that overpowered the police lines and breached the building. Members of the Oath Keepers were seen weaving through the crowd in military formation and entering the Rotunda. They're also accused of stashing weapons at a Virginia hotel before the riot.Dozens of members of these right-wing groups are now facing serious criminal charges tied to the January 6 riot, and judges have said many of them are too dangerous to release while they await trial.But so far, Democrats haven't been able to directly connect Trump to the violence that these groups perpetrated at the Capitol. There are plenty of connections between Trump associates and members of these groups, but there is scant evidence that Trump knew of any plan to violently disrupt Congress.The Justice Department has said Rhodes directed members of the Oath Keepers on January 6 while they stormed the Capitol and allegedly destroyed government property. He hasn't been charged with any crimes, even as prosecutors crack down on his followers. CNN reported in July that Rhodes gave a voluntary interview to the FBI and that investigators seized his cell phone. He has denied all wrongdoing.Tarrio is currently in jail after pleading guilty to burning a church's Black Lives Matter banner and bringing high-capacity rifle magazines into DC shortly before the January 6 insurrection. Those charges kept him out of DC on January 6. But he has remained defiant about the role that his organization played in the attack, saying the incident was worth celebrating, while nominally condemning violence.The committee has already issued subpoenas to dozens of people affiliated with the January 6 attack, including Trump White House advisers, Trump campaign officials, several key organizers of the political rally that preceded the riot, and pro-Trump provocateurs who were involved in ""Stop the Steal"" groups.The committee was established in July and has done most of its work in private. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat on the committee, told CNN on Saturday that the panel has already interviewed more than 200 witnesses, including many people who were ""part of the Trump administration."" But other Trump allies have followed Trump's directives to ignore the investigation altogether.Trump ally Steve Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress after defying the panel's subpoena for records and testimony. (He pleaded not guilty.) Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who played a key role in Trump's attempted coup, appeared for a deposition earlier this month but stonewalled the committee by refusing to answer questions, claiming the material was privileged.Proud Boys lawyer respondsA lawyer affiliated with Proud Boys International LLC said on Tuesday he plans to provide some already public documents about the group's formation and bylaws to the House. But he may not have Proud Boys records that speak to some of what the committee wants, such as documents about their activities late last year and around January 6. The lawyer and former Proud Boys chairman, Jason Van Dyke, said some of the documents he has about the group he also will try to protect under attorney-client privileges.Van Dyke received the committee's subpoena, he said, but hasn't had ties to the group since November 2018.""It's been a defunct entity since then. They're wasting their time,"" Van Dyke told CNN. ""They'll have to get it from Tarrio."" The committee acknowledged the Proud Boys International organization dissolved earlier this year.Attorneys for Tarrio and Rhodes have not responded to requests for comment.A spokesperson for the DC Department of Corrections, where Tarrio is still held, hasn't responded to several requests from CNN on whether the jail is allowing detainees to speak to the House select committee. Tarrio is set to be in jail into the new year.This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",2
56," (CNN)Sean Parnell, the Republican endorsed by former President Donald Trump for Pennsylvania's open US Senate seat, announced on Monday he is suspending his campaign. The decision comes after a judge awarded Laurie Snell, Parnell's estranged wife, primary physical custody and sole legal custody of the couple's three children, according to an order that was made public Monday. The judge also determined that Parnell committed some abusive acts toward his wife in the past.""There is nothing more important to me than my children, and while I plan to ask the court to reconsider, I can't continue with a Senate campaign,"" Parnell said in a statement.Parnell spoke with Trump on Monday to inform him of his plans, according to Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich. The former President had backed Parnell, an Army veteran and former congressional candidate, in September in the competitive Republican primary. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection, and Democrats see the seat as one of their top pickup opportunities heading into the 2022 midterms. But allegations against Parnell from his estranged wife had raised concerns among some Republicans about his viability as a candidate. Snell has accused Parnell of being physically abusive toward her and injuring their children on two occasions, claims that Parnell has denied.The judge wrote that he found Snell to be a credible witness when it came to her allegations of abuse -- although those allegations were not the most significant factors in the judge's custody decision.""I strongly disagree with the ruling today and I'm devastated by the decision. I plan on asking the court to reconsider this decision. In the order, two of the leading factors that weighed heavily in the judge's decision revolved around me being a leading U.S. Senate candidate,"" Parnell said in his statement. ""My focus right now is 100% on my children, and I want them to know I do not have any other priorities and will never stop fighting for them.""Parnell will still have partial physical custody of the children various weekends each month.""Ms. Snell is grateful that justice prevailed,"" according to a statement from the Gilliland Vanasdale Sinatra Law Office, which represented Snell. ""She has been awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of their children. She will continue, as always, to focus on their best interests."" 'A tumultuous relationship'   Court proceedings revealed a volatile relationship between Snell and Parnell, which ultimately hobbled Parnell's political aspirations.Snell has accused Parnell of throwing chairs at her; dropping her off on an interstate when she was six months pregnant and telling her to get an abortion; and choking and strangling her, according to court documents.""Upon consideration of the credible evidence, I find that Sean Parnell did commit some acts of abuse in the past,"" Judge James G. Arner wrote about the allegations of abuse regarding Snell. ""However, since the incidents involving Laurie Snell occurred so many years ago and did not involve the children, they are not relevant to this custody determination. I am not making a finding on specifically what did or did not happen.""As to the allegations that Parnell injured their children on two occasions, the judge concluded that the incidents occurred ""as described by Laurie Snell, but I am not placing weight on that evidence because a period of three and one half years has gone by without further incident.""The judge concluded that the incidents involving the children did not amount to child abuse and he noted that the children did not express concerns for their safety.""The fact that Laurie Snell has agreed that Sean Parnell can have substantial periods of unsupervised custody indicates she does not view him as a threat of harm to the children. The children have not expressed any concerns for their safety.""In evaluating the credibility of Snell and Parnell -- who often provided conflicting accounts in their custody trial testimony, particularly surrounding the abuse allegations -- the judge found Snell more credible.""She testified in a convincing manner. Her testimony was not uncertain, confused, self-contradictory, or evasive. Her testimony squares with Sean Parnell's testimony that they had a tumultuous relationship and fought a lot,"" the judge wrote.In contrast, the judge took issue with Parnell's demeanor in court, noting that Parnell dressed casually in jeans and untucked shirts. He also noted that Parnell looked at his attorneys and the news media during his testimony, rather than at the judge.""In evaluating Sean Parnell's testimony, I find it less credible. He simply denied that all of the incidents ever happened,"" the judge wrote. ""He was somewhat evasive. When weighing his position against Laurie Snell's statements of detailed facts about many incidents, Sean Parnell's position is less believable.""Senate campaign worked against Parnell In the judge's opinion, which followed a three-day custody trial, he concluded that both ""parents love their children and provide proper parental care for them,"" but he said the parents' failure to communicate and compromise prevented them from effectively sharing custody.The judge, who is required to consider 16 separate factors when determining custody, assigned the most weight to the children's need for stability and continuity, the parents' availability to care for the children and the level of conflict between the parents and their willingness to cooperate.Parnell's Senate campaign worked against him in the custody fight. The judge noted that Parnell would have been traveling frequently for a campaign and, if he had won, would have spent part of his time in Washington, DC.""These circumstances certainly restrict his ability to have primary physical custody of the children,"" the judge wrote.While Parnell had enjoyed Trump's endorsement in his Senate bid, the allegations from his estranged wife were taking a toll on his campaign, as CNN previously reported.Parnell had canceled fundraising events and ramped down his appearances in conservative media. Multiple Republican operatives in and out of Pennsylvania had told CNN they didn't see how Parnell's campaign -- which has leaned heavily on his children, including a large photo of him with them on his website's homepage -- could continue following the ruling.Earlier this month, Parnell staffers informed Trump's team that Parnell planned to suspend his campaign if he did not receive custody of his children.Budowich, the Trump spokesman, tweeted that the seat ""remains a top priority"" for Trump.This story has been updated with additional information.

57,"New York (CNN Business)The holiday travel season is off to a relatively smooth start, with good weather and few canceled flights. But many in the industry are worried that luck won't hold all the way until the holiday season ends just after New Year's. Major US airlines are operating with fewer pilots and flight attendants than they were before the pandemic. With domestic airline bookings nearly back to normal, airlines are trying to do more with less this holiday season.Service meltdowns in October at Southwest Airlines and American demonstrate what happens when schedules get disrupted without the staffing levels needed to rapidly recover from canceled flights. Problems quickly cascade, resulting in hundreds of additional cancellations.""I do think all of the airlines are stretched thin,"" said Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. ""A major blizzard or event could cause prolonged delays and cancellations.""And anyone who has their flight canceled is going to run into problems finding an alternative way to get where they're going.""If there are issues, reaccommodating people whose flights are canceled will be tough. The planes are very full,"" said Savi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James.Staffing shortagesThe airlines that have experienced recent service disruptions admitted they didn't have enough staff to deal with the problems.Bob Jordan, who is set to become CEO of Southwest early next year, told investors last month that weather and air traffic control issues caused ""a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position and then that took several days to recover.""""We inconvenienced thousands of customers and we further challenged our stellar employees,"" he said. ""And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees.""Jordan said Southwest is making additional trims to its schedule to make sure that doesn't happen again.When air traffic ground to a near halt during the early months of the pandemic, all the airlines used early retirement packages and buyouts to reduce staff voluntarily. All are scrambling to staff up now, but it takes time to hire, train and certify pilots and flight attendants, so much of the current hiring is being done with an eye toward next summer's travel season — not this fall and winter — said Syth.All the airlines say they're prepared to deal with disruptions caused by weather or other issues like air traffic control snafus.""To ensure we're providing certainty for both our customers and team members, we're doubling down on our efforts related to our schedule and staffing,"" said David Seymour, American's chief operating officer, in a note to the airline's staff. ""On the scheduling front, we've ensured that our November and December are built to meet customers demand and that they are fully supportable by our staffing.""But Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union at American and an active pilot himself, said he's concerned that American is stretching its staffing too thin.""We want to fly these flights. But the evidence from earlier this year shows what happens when things don't go as planned,"" he said. ""They're building the schedule right to the maximum number of flights possible and it provides no flexibility for when things go wrong. Airplanes don't fly on hope."" Southwest is trying to operate its current schedule with about 15% fewer pilots than it had before the pandemic, according to Murray, even though the number of flights hasn't been trimmed by nearly that much. That leaves much less ability to recover when issues do crop up.Fewer flightsOverall the number of domestic flights planned from last weekend to just after New Year's Day is down 12% compared to the same period in 2019, according to data from Cirium, an  airline data tracking service. Among the big four US airlines that handle about 80% of air traffic, Southwest and American have the most aggressive schedules compared to their pre-pandemic levels. The number of flights is down just 10% at Southwest and 9% at American, while Delta and United are both down more than 13% compared to 2019.Executives at United and Delta say their more limited schedule should allow them to avoid the service issues experienced at Southwest and American earlier this fall.""If we wanted to be bigger than we are, quite honestly we couldn't be. We could be a little bit, maybe, but not much bigger without risking the operational performance issues like you've seen at some of [the] other carriers,"" Delta president Glen Hauenstein told investors last month. ""So we want to stay where we're confident that we can actually fly the schedules that we put out there.""""Our North Star in this recovery is making sure we do the right thing for customers and if that means sacrificing some possible short-term profits to ensure a reliable operation, then so be it,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby in a letter to customers explaining his airline's reduced schedule.Murray, the head of the Southwest pilots union, says his airline has made changes in its operations since the service meltdown in October that resulted in 2,000 flights being canceled over a weekend, and tens of thousands of stranded passengers. ""I'm not as gravely concerned as I was throughout the summer,"" he said.",2
58,"New York (CNN Business)Expect to pay more for some of your favorite cereals, snacks, soups and cooking brands next year.General Mills (GIS) notified retail customers that it's raising prices in mid-January on hundreds of items across dozens of brands. They include Annie's, Progresso, Yoplait, Fruit Roll-Ups, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Cheerios, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charm's, Wheaties, Reese's Puffs, Trix and more, according to letters General Mills sent to at least one major regional wholesale supplier last week. For some items, prices will go up by around 20% beginning next year.The wholesaler shared General Mills' letters with CNN Business on the condition of anonymity to protect the company's relationship with its suppliers. A leader at the company said it plans to push along all of the increases to its grocery and convenience store customers. He expects they will then pass them down to shoppers.A spokesperson for General Mills did not provide a comment for this story.If more General Mills' customers — including the leading big box stores, supermarkets, drug stores and other chains in the United States — decide to do the same, these familiar brands will get more expensive for shoppers.General Mills' plans are the latest evidence that rising prices won't be going away anytime soon for some of the most recognizable food and household brands. The company is the latest consumer manufacturer to announce price hikes beginning next year, joining Tyson (TSN), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Mondelez (MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Kimberly Clark (KMB) and others.Rising pricesGrocery prices have increased sharply during the pandemic, after stagnating from 2015 through 2019. Prices climbed 1% in October from September and were 5.4% higher than at the same time last year, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Inflation on food, beverages and household basics will climb to 8% during the first half of 2022 before settling at 4% during the latter half of the year, projects IRI, a market research firm. IRI tracks prices, point-of-sale and volume data, promotions and trends at big-box stores, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, pharmacies and other consumer channels. Food manufacturers and grocery chains have faced higher costs for commodities, labor, transportation and other expenses during the pandemic. Those costs have escalated in recent months, prompting them to raise prices to minimize the impact.The producer-price index, which measures the price manufacturers receive for their goods and services, jumped 0.6% last month from September and rose 8.6% annually.General Mills said in the letters that it was responding to higher materials and labor costs. ""The current operating environment is as dynamic as we've experienced in at least a decade, resulting in significant input cost inflation, labor shortages, and challenges servicing the business,"" General Mills said. General Mills said in September that it expects its input cost inflation to be 7% to 8% for its 2022 fiscal year.Uneven impactRising inflation does not impact all shoppers equally. ""Inflation has been more painful for lower-income households,"" Bank of America economists said in a research report last week. That's because they are more exposed to the goods that are seeing prices rise the fastest, such as gas and rent, and they save less than higher-income groups. Some grocery chains are raising prices more quickly than competitors, depending on how much flexibility they have to handle higher costs. Walmart (WMT), the largest grocer in the United States, said its price gaps with competitors are wider than they were before the pandemic because the company is absorbing some costs instead of passing them on. Walmart accounted for 29% of General Mills' sales last year.",2

60," (CNN)Many members within the House of Representatives have told CNN in recent days that they find themselves in a toxic work environment, wrought with bitter exchanges, threats and fears about what the erosion of decorum in the chamber will mean for a body that has still not recovered 10 months after the Capitol Hill riot.In interviews with more than a dozen members, CNN heard from Democrats and some Republicans who say things are as bad as they can remember, with no sign things will get better soon, and the fears and concerns aren't just coming from members, but their families as well.Last week alone, Democrats and two Republicans voted to censure Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican from Arizona, for posting an animé video depicting the killing of fellow member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York. Initially, Gosar took the video down, but he retweeted another tweet containing the video just an hour after he endured the highest form of rebuke a member can get in the House. As he took his punishment in the well of the House, he was surrounded by a group of colleagues rushing to his defense. His leadership never came to the floor to admonish him, only attacking the process Democrats were using. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado, defended Gosar on the floor by calling some of her progressive Democratic colleagues the ""Jihad squad,"" a term she defended to CNN on Friday. ""It is shocking to me that Leader McCarthy would stand for eight and a half hours spewing disinformation about a bill that is for the American people and yet not speak a word about the atrocity of his own member putting out a video that glorifies the murder of a colleague and threatens violence against the President of the United States,"" said Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania. ""I don't know where the next basement is.""It's all part of the challenge members are facing now in the House, and some have opted to retire rather than endure more caustic behavior. On the outskirts of the House chamber, metal detectors are still stationed at every door, a reminder of the fears that remain. And an effort to investigate the root cause of the attack on January 6 has been politicized and met with resistance by most Republicans. Some have even downplayed whether the events of that day were all that bad. It's a constant reminder for some members about the state of their workplace. ""January 6th made things so much worse. I was on the floor that day. That was a forever life-changing moment on a personal level, but it was also a moment that changed Congress,"" Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Illinois, told CNN. ""It started with the incessant lies that weren't challenged and were amplified to January 6th to a member of Congress threatening lives of friends and colleagues."" In an interview with Rep. John Garamendi, a Democrat from California, Garamendi's wife Patricia could be heard in the background during the interview responding along with her husband that yes, the threats were as bad as they had ever been. Patricia Garamendi, who works closely with other congressional spouses on events and provides guidance on how to navigate Congress, agreed to speak with CNN for the story. She said that it's the scariest time she can remember for the spouses of members who worry not just about their member of Congress, but their entire families.""It took away a lot of the fun. Service is hard. Travel is hard and the issues are hard, but when you are worried about your family, it has been difficult,"" she said. ""I mean some kids are being escorted to school."" 'I'm not running again'And those are just the security threats. A massive battle over Covid-19 has only exasperated the divisions. A handful of conservative members regularly defy the House speaker's mask mandate, racking up thousands of dollars in fines while some members publicly admit they aren't getting vaccinated. Standing on the steps of the US House Friday, Bustos told CNN that all of the bitterness and lies impacted her decision not to run for reelection. ""My interns are down there,"" she pointed. ""I always write them five pieces of advice and one of those is 'don't take things personally.' I've tried to live that in politics. This, you can't help but take personally. All of this has contributed to the fact that I'm not running again. I want to love what I do. I want to love who I work with. I want to respect the people I work with and that has been compromised in ways that I hope can be repaired at some point, but right now I do not feel like I can repair.""Some of the anxiety members feel stems from bitter disagreements with the opposite party, while others say the spiral of toxicity has metastasized even to how members within the same party engage with one another. For months, progressives and moderates in the Democratic party grappled with how to pass both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a Democrat-only bill to expand the social safety net. But the divisions within their ranks threatened both bills and resulted in sometimes public and pointed personal jabs.""Toxic is spot-on,"" Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from Florida, said. ""I think there is plenty of Dem-on-Dem violence as well as Republican and Democratic divisions. I think it is not conducive to a healthy legislative environment for colleagues to make these debates both so personal and caustic.""'People here need to get thicker skin'In a series of interviews with Republicans, many downplayed the divisions outright or blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for setting the wrong tone when she announced all members would need to walk through metal detectors to get to the House floor after the insurrection. ""I believe it is a consolidation of power in the Speaker's office in the House and an abuse of power by the Speaker because she has one-party control and she is completely shutting down the voices of the minority and hiding behind Covid to accomplish it,"" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers, a Republican from Washington state, told CNN. Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas who advocated ahead of January 6 to certify the electoral college results, told CNN that part of the problem is that members have not moved on from January 6th.""People here need to get thicker skin,"" Roy said. ""At some point here, you gotta let some things roll.""Asked if he was including the insurrection in the things that people needed to let ""roll,"" Roy said ""people here have got to get thicker skin about representing the people and doing their job and not making everything personal on the floor of the House.""'I feel safe, but it is incredibly concerning'But for some members, the threats are very personal. ""Congressman Boebert referred to us as the 'Jihad squad' on the House floor. What that does is it empowers and inspires people who want to do us harm, to actually go and do that harm. She is on the House floor spewing 'Jihad squad,' "" Rep. Jamaal Bowman said. ""I feel safe, but it is incredibly concerning that she is speaking this way and we have to respond to that in some way.""Ocasio-Cortez, who was the subject of Gosar's animé video, told CNN last week that sometimes it is impossible to separate the political from the personal, even as she has tried to build relationships with some Republicans. ""It is not just because they dislike me as a person. In fact, I have had many a Republican come to me on the House floor and say 'I tell folks back home that while I don't agree with you, I think you are a quite kind person.' I have had Republicans come up to me after the 6th, one of them even weeping and with guilt over what happened,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""So for some ... publicly, this is a performance. But it is also personal because I cannot separate myself from my gender, I cannot separate myself of how I was born, so their hatred of non-White people, their hatred of women is a hatred of me.""",2
61," (CNN)Internal Supreme Court documents that could enhance public understanding of the Bush v. Gore election battle and other significant cases of the late 1990s and early 2000s were to be opened last year under a deal forged by a long-serving justice, but the high court has delayed release of the materials, citing the pandemic. The late Justice John Paul Stevens, whose tenure spanned 35 years, planned for most of his case files to be opened and ""freely available"" at the Library of Congress by October 2020. His arrangement with the library -- the details of which have not been previously reported -- covers cases up to October 1, 2005.  Along with the 2000 Bush v. Gore decision that continues to reverberate in election-law controversies, the trove would include documents related to two groundbreaking gay-rights decisions, a seminal University of Michigan affirmative action dispute and several post-9/11 Guantanamo detainee appeals. The release of once-private files can help illuminate one of the country's most secretive institutions, even as the open files often spawn tensions among still sitting justices. The justices keep many of their procedures confidential and all their negotiations occur behind closed doors. Historians, law professors and journalists mine the papers to understand how the nine operate. The files, which typically include draft opinions and memos written among justices, can shed light on the strategies of individual justices and nature of deliberations, why some appeals were taken, others rejected, and whether justices may have switched votes in cases heard. Such behind-the-scenes vote changes have made a difference in abortion disputes as documents from other justices' collections have revealed.The new Stevens files could reveal private conversations around a separate social policy dilemma, related to LGBTQ rights. He was the senior justice in the majority when the court in 2003 struck down a Texas ban on private sexual conduct between gay adults, and earlier in 1996, when it blocked a Colorado measure that prevented cities from passing antidiscrimination laws to protect gay people. Yet archives that augment the historical record have in the past created internal conflict.In 1993, when the papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall were opened at the Library of Congress just months after his death, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist became furious with Library officials, questioning whether Marshall indeed wanted all his files opened so quickly. Rehnquist wrote a letter of rebuke to then-Librarian of Congress James Billington on behalf of the court majority.Rehnquist had tried but failed to induce all eight associate justices to sign the letter, but in the end had to say he was writing for a ""majority of the active Justices."" Some of the justices who declined to join in said they believed Marshall had wanted his papers to be released after his death.Marshall indeed had set the terms of the release of the materials that covered his tenure through 1991.  Rehnquist also tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade colleagues to agree for the future to withhold private documents for set periods, for example, as long as all justices with whom an individual served had retired or died.The files of Justice Harry Blackmun, later turned over with his archive to the Library of Congress, show that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor strongly agreed with Rehnquist in 1993 that the justices should set timelines for the release of papers. According to Blackmun's notes, the vote was 6-3 and Rehnquist did not want to impose any rule without unanimity.The three justices who voted against the proposed limits were Blackmun, Stevens and Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016 and whose files are now housed at Harvard but closed for the near future.The Supreme Court public information office said Stevens' papers were still being organized for transfer and that the Covid-19 pandemic had slowed the effort. Library officials said they have no date for when the materials would be turned over. Once in hand, the library would sort and catalog the materials for public access. Stevens, who died in 2019, finalized the agreement for his papers with Librarian of Congress Billington on January 3, 2005, Library officials told CNN. A supplemental agreement was signed on April 20, 2010, which happened to be the day Stevens turned 90 and the year he retired. He was the third longest serving justice in court history. (Billington died in 2018.)  The opening of justices' archives flow from special arrangements by individual justices with the Library of Congress and various universities.  The late Justice Blackmun arranged to have his extensive files opened in 2004. That move further riled sitting justices. Blackmun had saved just about everything he ever wrote or received from a colleague.  Under court practice, a justice sends copies of memos directed to an individual justice during case negotiations to the whole group. Some justices plainly want greater control for posterity over the correspondence they write. Justice Stephen Breyer, in a recent conversation with CNN related to his new book, ""The Authority of the Court and the Peril of Politics,"" said he had not yet decided whether to turn his papers over to a library. Breyer said the justices have an ""informal understanding"" that certain documents, such as draft opinions and memoranda among justices, would be withheld from public view until after the death of other justices who served on the cases. Breyer acknowledged that such a pact might conflict with individual justice's wishes regarding their papers.  The court's Public Information Office did not respond to questions about whether any formal or informal agreement for the release of confidential files is in place under Chief Justice John Roberts, who succeeded Rehnquist in 2005. The PIO also declined to answer questions related to any screening of Stevens' files or possible removal of documents. Susan Stevens Mullen, a daughter of the late justice, said she was not concerned about any culling of his files. In an email exchange with CNN, she attributed the delayed transfer of her father's materials ""to COVID and the impact that closures and work-from-home has had on final review and organization of the papers.""The Library of Congress is also awaiting the transfer of files belonging to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Court officials said that release has also been slowed because of the pandemic. Although Ginsburg's case files are all scheduled to be housed at the Library, case files will be closed to most researchers as long as any justice who participated in the decision in the matter is alive.  Stevens' role in a historical age  Stevens, a 1975 appointee of Republican President Gerald Ford, was known for an independent approach and became a leading liberal of the bench. The Chicago native whose work in Naval intelligence during World War II earned him a Bronze Star, had lone legal career, beginning with a Supreme Court clerkship in 1947-48, then becoming a specialist in antitrust law, before appointment to a US appellate court seat in 1970 and then the Supreme Court. He retired at the age of 90 and continued to write books and essays until his death at age 99. Stevens put no restrictions on his files for the Library of Congress beyond separating them into two categories: materials created before October 1, 2005, and materials created on or after that date. The first set was to be made available ""after the first Monday in October in the year 2020,"" which would have been October 6. (Stevens' case files through 1984 can be viewed by researchers at the Library; those cover much of the ground in the files of other justices; the late 1990s and early 2000s material would likely be of most value to researchers and the broader public.) The latter batch after 2005, coinciding with when Roberts became chief justice, would not become available under the Stevens' agreement until ""the first Monday in October in the year 2030."" (The justices begin their annual sessions on the first Monday in October.)  Stevens declined to condition the release of case files on whether justices who participated in the cases were still alive, and the gift agreement includes no exceptions or exclusions regarding the material to be donated, Library officials said. That means his files would contain correspondence with sitting Justices Breyer and Clarence Thomas and with retired living Justices O'Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy. The materials would also include the work of relatively recently deceased justices Ginsburg (who served 1993-2020), Scalia (1986-2016) and Rehnquist (1972-2005).  Those eight justices and Stevens decided the 2000 Florida election dispute between then Texas Governor George W. Bush and then Vice President Al Gore. Their 5-4 decision, ensuring that Bush won the White House, hung over last year's election as the Donald Trump's legal team tried to rely on some of its reasoning to challenge state election practices and final results that showed Joe Biden won the presidency. Stevens, the court's senior liberal at the time, dissented in Bush v. Gore along with the other justices on the left. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, Stevens, alternatively, was able to seize the majority for decisions that limited President Bush's assertion of executive branch power and ensured some protection for detainee rights. Stevens also led the majority in two important gay rights cases: the 1996 Romer v. Evans and 2003 Lawrence v. Texas. The papers could help explain his strategy that included assigning both cases to Kennedy, who became the voice of the court on LGBTQ interests in the years that followed, including to declare a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in 2015.Another major case Stevens shepherded during this era was Clinton v. Jones, in which the court ruled unanimously that then-President Bill Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to avoid a civil lawsuit for alleged sexual misconduct.The approach Stevens negotiated for his archive donation to the Library of Congress largely follows that of Marshall (1967-1991) and Blackmun (1970-1994) at the Library of Congress and Justice Lewis Powell (1972-1987), whose materials are housed at the Washington and Lee Law School. Once those files were opened, researchers could readily find documents involving still-sitting justices. Library of Congress spokesman Brett Zongker said the Library has been in contact with the Supreme Court regarding timing for a transfer of Stevens' materials, but no date has yet been given. Processing and cataloging of files would occur at the Library, and Zongker said it was difficult to estimate how long that would take. He said that first nine years of Stevens' files, through 1984, were received more than a decade ago and took less than four months to process. However, Zongker wrote that, ""The Library anticipates that the remaining portion of the collection will include a greater variety of papers ... relating to his entire life as well as Supreme Court case files, dockets, and other material covering"" Stevens' subsequent decades on the bench.

62,"Washington (CNN)Brendan Hunt -- whose father is a retired judge and who allegedly threatened the lives of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, now-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- was sentenced Monday to 19 months in prison after being found guilty of one count of threatening to assault or murder US officials. ""We will not tolerate threats to members of the United States Congress or calls to overthrow our democratically elected government,"" US Attorney of the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace said in a statement. ""Not only will we investigate and vigorously prosecute these crimes, but today's sentence sends a clear message that those who seek to harm our representatives and bring chaos to our democracy will be punished,"" he said.Hunt, the son of retired New York City family court judge John Hunt, had been convicted by a jury in Brooklyn federal court in April.Prosecutors argued at the time that Hunt had posted videos of himself at his Queens home in January discussing the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, threatening to kill senators and encouraging others to go back to the Capitol on Inauguration Day and take their guns.Hunt took the stand in his own defense during the trial, telling the court that he didn't really mean what he said in videos and messaging apps about killing elected officials. Hunt testified that he didn't think his rhetoric about killing elected officials could bear real penal consequences because he'd seen the prevalence of ""kill Trump"" rhetoric, especially from celebrities.In a Facebook account registered to HuntBrendan, prosecutors said, Hunt posted his praise in December for people who have fought back against Covid-19 mitigation protocols -- and praised violence against police but also said people should instead ""go after a high value target"" like Pelosi, Schumer or Ocasio-Cortez.Prosecutors also showed the jury text messages that Hunt allegedly sent to his father around the time of the presidential election. In the string of messages, Hunt allegedly mentioned Adolf Hitler and said the American people would support then-President Donald Trump if he overrode the democratic process like Hitler did to remain president despite the election looking like it was leaning in now-President Joe Biden's favor.When asked about discriminatory rants to his father in private text messages, Hunt testified that he purposely said extreme statements to anger his dad but doesn't actually hold racist beliefs.",2
63," (CNN)An Indiana man charged with carrying a loaded firearm onto the US Capitol grounds and assaulting police officers during the January 6 riot told investigators that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, ""you'd be here for another reason,"" according to recently unsealed court documents.Mark Mazza has been charged with five federal crimes, including illegal possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds and assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers with a dangerous weapon.According to the court documents, he lost his firearm during a battle with police on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol building. Police recovered the gun -- a Taurus revolver -- which was loaded with five rounds, including shotgun ammunition capable of going after ""multiple targets at the same time,"" investigators said.Investigators found Mazza after he reported to local police that the gun was stolen from his car in Ohio, though he later admitted to the FBI that he falsified the report in case a member of Antifa found and killed someone with the weapon. Mazza also denied assaulting police, though footage from the Capitol building allegedly shows Mazza swinging a baton at a line of officers.Mazza told investigators that he ""never did get to talk to Nancy"" and thought he and the California Democrat would ""hit it off.""""I was glad I didn't, because you'd be here for another reason,"" he said.Mazza also claimed he was prepared to surrender because he ""may go down as a hero,"" referred to himself as a nonviolent patriot and requested that he be placed in a ""fed,"" if he was arrested so that he would be given ""three squares, a nice clean room"" and free health care.

64," (CNN)President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced the release of emergency oil reserves to combat high energy prices ahead of the busy holiday travel season, but it will be weeks before the barrels hit the market. The Department of Energy will release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the White House -- the largest release from the reserve in US history, Biden said.Biden on Tuesday noted that the administration's actions ""will not solve the problem of high gas prices overnight."" ""It will take time, but before long, you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank,"" he said during his remarks. ""And in the longer term, we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy."" The release is aimed at addressing the lack of oil supply around the world, but its actual effect may be limited. In 2019, US petroleum use averaged approximately 20.5 million barrels of oil per day and in 2020 the US used on average about 18.1 million barrels per day, according to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. The EIA reports petroleum usage was lower in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The barrels of oil involved in Tuesday's announcement will not hit the market until ""mid to late December, depending on market take up,"" according to a senior administration official.""We're taking action. The big part of the reason Americans are facing high gas prices is because oil producing countries and large companies have not ramped up the supply of oil quickly enough to meet the demand. And the smaller supply means higher prices globally, globally, for oil,"" Biden said during remarks at the White House. This release will be in coordination with several other countries, including China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom. Officials believe the coordinated effort could potentially have more of an effect on lowering gas prices.As of Friday, there were 604.5 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Department of Energy.The move comes as the White House faces mounting pressure to lower skyrocketing prices at the pump that are contributing to the biggest inflation spike in decades, causing frustration and anger among Americans. The President on Tuesday called the issue a ""problem"" both in the US and around the world, and stressed that while spikes in prices are usually temporary, ""it doesn't mean we should just stand by idly and wait for prices to drop on their own.""Thirty-two million barrels will be in exchange ""over the next several months,"" the White House said, and those barrels will eventually return to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ""in the years ahead."" Eighteen million barrels ""will be an acceleration into the next several months of a sale of oil that Congress had previously authorized.""""American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic,"" the White House said in a news release. ""That's why President Biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply.""CNN previously reported Biden hoped to announce his decision to release the oil reserves during a Tuesday speech at the White House, but that the timing of such a move was still contingent on other nations finalizing their agreements.The President made his remarks just hours before he is set to leave for a Thanksgiving break on Nantucket off the coast of Massachusetts.Biden had been privately advised in recent weeks that tapping into the reserve wouldn't do much to alleviate the current problems, but some Democratic lawmakers argued it could provide temporary relief at the pump. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was among the Democrats leading the charge.Despite being told the impact may be negligible, the option to release oil reserves remained on the table, given Biden had few others, and officials believed coordinating with other countries could potentially have more of an effect. One option was increasing domestic oil production, but the White House has been wary of the optics of the President and his aides pushing for more drilling at home on the heels of the major UN climate summit COP26, where Biden promised that the US would ""lead by example"" on clean energy initiatives.The national gas price average as of Tuesday is $3.403, according to AAA, which is significantly higher than the average at the same time last year when many people were not driving or traveling as much due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is unclear how much the White House effort would immediately affect prices.The move may instead largely act as a signal to OPEC nations and Russia that the US is serious about taking action to lower prices after those nations were reluctant to ramp up oil production to reduce prices.Biden officials have warned the Saudis for weeks that the US would find alternative solutions if the price of crude oil topped $85 a barrel, officials said, which it did late last month. But Saudi Arabia has stood firm in refusing to increase output and has priced in -- wrongly, in the view of US officials -- the possibility that the US reaches a nuclear deal with Iran, two US officials said. The Saudis' concern is that sanctions on Iran would then be rolled back, allowing the country to ramp up its oil production and compete with OPEC+.Given that reluctance, the Biden administration viewed coordinating with the other nations as an attempt to undermine the cartel's control of the market.""The thinking has been, we can do this alone, or we can do it internationally -- and the latter would be much more effective, especially when it comes to sending a message to the Saudis,"" said one senior official involved in the discussions.Biden has taken other actions as well. Last week, the President asked the Federal Trade Commission to ""immediately"" investigate whether illegal activity by oil and gas companies is pushing up gas prices. That move isn't likely to have an immediate effect on gas prices for consumers, but is another example that Biden is seeking to show he is working to bring prices down. The FTC's findings could also help in the long run if they find wrongdoing. The oil industry's top advocacy group slammed that move as a ""distraction.""Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said at Tuesday's White House press briefing that gas and oil companies have financially ""taken advantage"" of the high prices.""We have 250 fewer oil rigs that are functioning today than we did before the pandemic, and yet, the oil and gas industry has leases on 23 million acres of public lands on and offshore,"" Granholm said. ""Over 9,500 permits have been issued that are not being used. At the same time, the energy industry is making enormous profits. They're back up to above where they were before the pandemic started. So, they have taken advantage of that moment.""This story has been updated with additional information. ",2
65," (CNN)Steve Bannon turned the January 6 committee into a politicized spectacle but Alex Jones and Roger Stone could conjure a theater of the absurd out of the probe into one of the most jarring assaults on democracy in US history.The Infowars demagogue and the Nixonian self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" became the latest acolytes of ex-President Donald Trump to get hit by subpoenas by the House select committee on Monday.The move was another indication the panel is digging into the organization and funding of Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally, in which both men were allegedly involved, which mushroomed into the Capitol insurrection. Their testimony -- should they appear before the panel -- could shed light on the key question for the committee about whether the rally had a pre-ordained purpose to trigger an uprising designed to halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden's election win. The subpoenas underscored a fast-track strategy by a Democratic-led committee that is unlikely to survive if Republicans, who have long protected Trump, win the House in next year's midterm elections. The panel is working feverishly and has interviewed more than 200 witnesses, including many members of the Trump administration who came forward voluntarily.But given the penchant of Stone and Jones for histrionic legal fights, the committee is unlikely to expect quick cooperation. Past behavior is not always predictive, and Stone especially has just emerged from a costly legal fight after his conviction for lying to Congress in another Trump-related case, for which he was pardoned by the ex-President. But like Jones, he has a long record of using moments of accountability to stage political stunts and promote extremism.Stone said in a statement that he had ""no advance knowledge"" of the events at the Capitol on January 6 and that any claim or report alleging or implying he did was ""categorically false."" He later told CNN affiliate KOKI he would ""would probably assert my 5th Amendment right, decline to be interviewed.""The committee has also shown it is ready to hold recalcitrant witnesses to account, after the House cited Bannon, another longtime Trump political adviser like Stone, for criminal contempt. The Justice Department has initiated a prosecution. Like Bannon, neither Jones nor Stone appears to have a strong case to claim contacts with Trump are shielded by executive privilege since neither were serving as administration officials. But arguing the point in court could use time that the committee does not have given grim prospects for Democrats of keeping the House in 2022. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has a stronger claim to executive privilege, is locked in a standoff with the committee. He is refusing to testify but has not been cited for contempt.The reputations of Stone and Jones, who are both political bomb throwers who pushed the lie that Trump won the election, suggest that neither will be able to resist the notoriety of a public duel with the panel.""If you think Steve Bannon upped the drama queen value on responding to a charge of a misdemeanor, my guess is we ain't seen nothing yet,"" said Andrew McCabe, a former deputy director of the FBI who is now a senior CNN law enforcement analyst.But Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California -- a committee member who, as a law student worked in Congress on the Watergate scandal involving Stone's mentor, President Richard Nixon -- said that Stone and Jones had no option but to testify.""You don't lie to Congress or else you're going to fall into other trouble, criminal law trouble. They are characters, but they have to come in and tell the truth,"" she said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""Stone and Jones were not the only new witnesses targeted on Monday. The committee also sent subpoenas to Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, key players in the ""Stop the Steal"" movement, and Taylor Budowich, who currently serves as Trump's spokesman.A committee with a grave purpose A new round of exhibitionism by spotlight-hungry members of Trump's orbit will not disguise the critical purpose of the committee. Trump, after all, tried to use the powers of the presidency to violate the will of voters and to destroy democratic institutions based on a lie of a stolen 2020 election. And given that Trump could run again for the White House as an unmasked wanna-be autocrat, the panel's eventual findings could be vital reading for voters in 2024.The ex-President's selfish refusal to accept the will of voters was laid bare in a Washington court room on Monday. In a plea hearing for a Capitol riot defendant, federal Judge Reggie Walton compared Trump to former Vice President Al Gore after the Supreme Court decided the disputed 2000 election in George W. Bush's favor.""Al Gore had a better case to argue than Mr. Trump, but he was a man about what happened to him,"" Walton said. ""He accepted it and walked away.""In another stark reminder of the stakes for the committee, unsealed documents revealed an apparent threat to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from Mark Mazza of Indiana, who was charged with carrying a loaded firearm onto the Capitol grounds. Mazza told investigators that if he had reached the speaker's office on January 6, they'd ""be here for another reason.""Besides seeking testimony from officials and outside allies who were close to Trump and his campaign, the January 6 committee has been fighting him in court over his effort to assert executive privilege over memos, schedules, visitor logs and other documents related to the January 6 period. Lawyers for the House said in a court filing on Monday that the investigators needed the ex-President's private papers in order to consider legislation to prevent future repeats of the insurrection. ""Any inquiry that did not insist on examining Mr. Trump's documents and communications would be worse than useless—the equivalent of staging a production of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark,"" their filing said.Digging deep into 'Stop the Steal'Stone has rarely been far from controversy since Trump transformed American politics by launching his campaign in 2015. He was found guilty in November 2019 of lying to and obstructing Congress in a case that shed light on the extent of Trump's knowledge about the release of stolen Democratic emails in 2016 by Wikileaks. So he has already established his reputation as a witness who is unlikely to turn on the ex-President. In an unrelated tax case Monday, his attorneys argued he was being hounded over his support for Trump.""This case would never have been brought if it didn't involve Roger Stone,"" the filing said.The House select committee has previously issued several subpoenas to organizers of rallies in Washington, DC, on January 5 and 6 that preceded the insurrection. CNN has reported that the investigation has included questions about security forces at the rallies and those associated with Stone and others.Court records show prosecutors accused two members of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers of text messaging about providing security to Stone. An Oath Keeper who appeared to be protecting Stone on January 6 later joined an angry mob outside the Capitol, according to video and images reviewed by CNN and four sources who confirmed his identity.In its letter to Jones, the committee stated that he was denied a speaking spot at the January 6 rally but that his previous comments indicate he was designated to ""lead a march to the Capitol, where President Trump would meet the group."" The committee acknowledged that once at the Capitol, Jones told people ""not to be violent."" Trump never showed up on Capitol Hill.Jones' subpoena landed less than two months after he was found legally responsible in two lawsuits for damages caused by his false claim that the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 26 people including 20 young children died, was a hoax.Lofgren told CNN's Jim Acosta on ""The Situation Room"" that Stone had raised money for security for the ""Stop the Steal"" rally through his websites and that Jones had claimed to raise most of the cash needed to stage the January 6 event.There is nothing wrong with staging a political rally. Even Trump's lies about the election being stolen are protected free speech. But the committee appears to be trying to find out whether the Capitol riot was a direct mob reaction to those lies peddled by Trump at the rally or if the ex-President or those in his orbit specifically laid the groundwork for the protest turning into an insurrection.",2
66," (CNN)The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection issued five new subpoenas on Tuesday targeting right-wing extremist groups that were involved in the attack, including the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.The subpoenas went to the Proud Boys and its leader Enrique Tarrio, as well as the Oath Keepers and its leader Stewart Rhodes. Dozens of members of both groups have been charged in the attack on the US Capitol, and prosecutors have said they conspired ahead of time to disrupt the Electoral College proceedings. (Tarrio and Rhodes have not been charged.)The panel also subpoenaed Robert Patrick Lewis, chairman of 1st Amendment Praetorian, a group that the committee says provided security at ""multiple rallies leading up to January 6.""""We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the committee, said in a statement.Several dozen subpoenas have already been issued as part of the investigation, with mixed success. Investigators say they've spoken to more than 200 witnesses, but some key players from former President Donald Trump's world have stonewalled the probe and refused to testify or produce documents.Right-wing extremists played a major role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Leaders of the Proud Boys were involved in some of the early clashes that overpowered the police lines and breached the building. Members of the Oath Keepers were seen weaving through the crowd in military formation and entering the Rotunda. They're also accused of stashing weapons at a Virginia hotel before the riot.Dozens of members of these right-wing groups are now facing serious criminal charges tied to the January 6 riot, and judges have said many of them are too dangerous to release while they await trial.But so far, Democrats haven't been able to directly connect Trump to the violence that these groups perpetrated at the Capitol. There are plenty of connections between Trump associates and members of these groups, but there is scant evidence that Trump knew of any plan to violently disrupt Congress.The Justice Department has said Rhodes directed members of the Oath Keepers on January 6 while they stormed the Capitol and allegedly destroyed government property. He hasn't been charged with any crimes, even as prosecutors crack down on his followers. CNN reported in July that Rhodes gave a voluntary interview to the FBI and that investigators seized his cell phone. He has denied all wrongdoing.Tarrio is currently in jail after pleading guilty to burning a church's Black Lives Matter banner and bringing high-capacity rifle magazines into DC shortly before the January 6 insurrection. Those charges kept him out of DC on January 6. But he has remained defiant about the role that his organization played in the attack, saying the incident was worth celebrating, while nominally condemning violence.The committee has already issued subpoenas to dozens of people affiliated with the January 6 attack, including Trump White House advisers, Trump campaign officials, several key organizers of the political rally that preceded the riot, and pro-Trump provocateurs who were involved in ""Stop the Steal"" groups.The committee was established in July and has done most of its work in private. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat on the committee, told CNN on Saturday that the panel has already interviewed more than 200 witnesses, including many people who were ""part of the Trump administration."" But other Trump allies have followed Trump's directives to ignore the investigation altogether.Trump ally Steve Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress after defying the panel's subpoena for records and testimony. (He pleaded not guilty.) Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who played a key role in Trump's attempted coup, appeared for a deposition earlier this month but stonewalled the committee by refusing to answer questions, claiming the material was privileged.Proud Boys lawyer respondsA lawyer affiliated with Proud Boys International LLC said on Tuesday he plans to provide some already public documents about the group's formation and bylaws to the House. But he may not have Proud Boys records that speak to some of what the committee wants, such as documents about their activities late last year and around January 6. The lawyer and former Proud Boys chairman, Jason Van Dyke, said some of the documents he has about the group he also will try to protect under attorney-client privileges.Van Dyke received the committee's subpoena, he said, but hasn't had ties to the group since November 2018.""It's been a defunct entity since then. They're wasting their time,"" Van Dyke told CNN. ""They'll have to get it from Tarrio."" The committee acknowledged the Proud Boys International organization dissolved earlier this year.Attorneys for Tarrio and Rhodes have not responded to requests for comment.A spokesperson for the DC Department of Corrections, where Tarrio is still held, hasn't responded to several requests from CNN on whether the jail is allowing detainees to speak to the House select committee. Tarrio is set to be in jail into the new year.This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",2
67," (CNN)In the wake of the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a new generation of teen activists emerged who insisted that the old boom/bust cycle of gun control politics in this country was no more.Gone would be the public's short attention span on the need for more restrictions on gun sales and gun ownership. And in its place would be a sustained campaign to keep the issues of guns -- and the mass shootings committed with them -- front and center in the public's mind.Almost four years on from Parkland, however, a familiar cycle has asserted itself.Just 52% of Americans polled now say that the ""laws covering the sales of firearms"" should be stricter than they currently are, the lowest number that Gallup has measured on the question since 2014.That marks a remarkable erosion on the question from just three years ago as the country was still reeling from the 17 people killed in Parkland. At that point, two thirds of respondents favored more strict gun laws. In 2019, there were still 64% of people who told Gallup they wanted stricter gun laws. That dropped to 57% in 2020 and now 52% in 2021.As Gallup noted in its release: ""Americans' support for stricter gun laws has typically risen in the aftermath of high-profile mass shootings and fallen during periods without such events. Changes in the party occupying the White House may also influence preferences for gun laws. Generally, the public favors stricter laws when Republicans are in office and less strict laws when Democrats are."" ""Something about Parkland has been different,"" Melissa Strassner, a survivor of the Columbine school shooting in 1999, told the New York Times in 2019. ""They truly have inspired a nation.""There is no question there is some truth to that sentiment. Not only did support for stricter gun laws stay higher for more than a year following the Parkland shooting, state legislatures took unprecedented actions to limit guns.  As Pew noted in 2018: ""This was a year of unparalleled success for the gun-control movement in the United States. States across the country, including 14 with Republican governors, enacted 50 new laws restricting access to guns, ranging from banning bump stocks to allowing authorities to temporarily disarm potentially violent people.""But, at least at the federal level, legislative momentum has been harder to harness. Commemorating the three-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting this past February, President Joe Biden called on Congress to act.""I am calling on Congress to enact commonsense gun law reforms, including requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets,"" Biden said. ""We owe it to all those we've lost and to all those left behind to grieve to make a change. The time to act is now.""While the Democratic-led House passed two measures to strengthen background checks, the Senate is not expected to act on either one.Meanwhile, Americans are buying more guns than ever before. In 2020, nearly 23 million guns were bought -- a record. That surge has continued through 2021.And, there has been no letup in mass shootings either. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 638 mass shootings so far in 2021. (The site defines a mass shooting as one with 4 or more victims, either injured or killed, not including the gunman.)So, what happened? It appears that after an extended period of time in which the public was supportive of more strict gun laws, the old political rules of the gun debate have reasserted themselves.A new Quinnipiac poll also out this week finds registered voters split 47% to 48% between supporting stricter gun laws and opposing them. That's also the lowest support for stricter gun laws among voters since late 2015 in Quinnipiac's polling. In February 2018, it reached a high of 66% in their poll. A Pew Research poll back in April this year found a generally similar pattern.What Parkland did was keep the issue in the news -- and on peoples' minds -- longer. But these latest numbers from Gallup suggest the issue has now begun to recede again.",2
68,"Washington (CNN)The Biden administration said in a court filing on Monday that the House select committee's investigation into January 6 is needed to fully understand former President Donald Trump's role in the US Capitol attack, arguing that his presidential records be turned over to Congress. Lawyers from the Justice Department -- representing the Biden administration, including the National Archives, which holds the Trump-era records -- said that the House has ""sufficient reason"" to try to learn what Trump and others knew before the violence. The filing came as Trump  tries to overturn a lower-court decision and keep the records secret.""Far from 'fishing,' or looking to the former President and his advisors as a 'case study,' the Select Committee is investigating known events involving the former President and other White House officials and relating to a singular attack on the Capitol,"" the Justice Department lawyers wrote.It's unusual for Congress and the executive branch to be so aligned in a court case over presidential powers, and the Biden administration has taken up many of the same arguments the House is making about why it needs to investigate. Previously, the Biden administration said it would not assert executive privilege to protect Trump-era residential records because of the ""unique and extraordinary"" nature of the Capitol siege.The argument in the legal brief is some of the strongest language yet from the Biden administration endorsing the House probe into Trump.""The Select Committee thus has sufficient reason to probe, among other things: (1) what, if anything, the former President, his advisors, other government officials, and those close to him knew about the likelihood of the protest turning violent; (2) when they knew it; (3) whether they sought to encourage or prevent it and the actions they took in response; and (4) how, if at all, their actions facilitated, exacerbated or led to the violence that overtook the protest,"" lawyers from the Biden administration wrote.Also in a Monday court filing, lawyers for the House said they need to investigate the former President's private papers as they seek to consider legislation aimed at protecting future elections. The House wants the records soon, and the lawyers argued against letting the court process drag out.""Future elections are imminent and there could be future attacks on democracy rooted in conduct occurring well before the election,"" the lawyers wrote. ""The Select Committee's task to study and suggest legislation to ensure that January 6 is not repeated, and that our Nation's democracy is protected from future attacks, is urgent.""To counter Trump's claims that his public statements are already available, and so records of White House discussions aren't needed, the House invoked Shakespeare.""Any inquiry that did not insist on examining Mr. Trump's documents and communications would be worse than useless—the equivalent of staging a production of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark,"" their filing said.Both the Biden administration and the House filed their arguments to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday, and are unified in believing the Trump White House records related to January 6 should be released to the House. Trump sued to keep the records secret, saying he should have a say in executive privilege claims as an ex-president, and lost at the trial-level court. A three-judge panel at the federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on November 30. The National Archives is temporarily paused from turning over the disputed documents, such as call logs and notes from Trump's chief of staff and press secretary, as the appeals court considers the matter.The case tests major questions about executive privilege, congressional inquiries and the power of a former President.",2
69," (CNN)The House select committee investigating the January 6 riot issued a new round of subpoenas on Monday to five of former President Donald Trump's allies directly involved in planning ""Stop the Steal"" rallies, including longtime Republican operative Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The latest batch of subpoenas indicates the committee continues to focus, in part, on organizers and funding of the ""Stop the Steal"" rallies that took place on January 5 and 6, as well as earlier rallies in the months leading up to the US Capitol attack. Also subpoenaed by the committee Monday: Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, key players in the ""Stop the Steal"" movement after the election, who the committee noted are engaged to each other. Stockton was one of the administrators of a ""Stop the Steal"" Facebook group that amassed hundreds of thousands of followers before it was shut down by the social media company on November 5 -- the day after it was launched. According to the committee's subpoena letter, Stockton helped organize a series of rallies after the November 2020 election up to the rally held at the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on January 6, aimed at supporting then-President Trump and his claims of election fraud.Taylor Budowich, who is currently the primary political spokesperson for the former President and serves as communications director for the Save America PAC, was the final individual subpoenaed Monday. ""The Select Committee is seeking information about the rallies and subsequent march to the Capitol that escalated into a violent mob attacking the Capitol and threatening our democracy. We need to know who organized, planned, paid for, and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organizers had with officials in the White House and Congress,"" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, said in a statement.""We believe the witnesses we subpoenaed today have relevant information and we expect them to cooperate fully with our effort to get answers for the American people about the violence of January 6th,"" he added.The committee is asking the five individuals to produce documents on December 6 and has scheduled deposition dates for them throughout mid-December.Alex Jones In its letter to Jones, the committee cites press reports and his own statements to claim that Jones worked with January 6 rally organizers Cindy Chafian and Caroline Wren, both of whom have been subpoenaed by the select committee, in ""facilitating a donor, now known to be Julie Fancelli, to provide what [he] characterized as 'eighty percent' of the funding"" for the rally held on the Ellipse on January 6. The committee states that Jones was denied a speaking spot at the January 6 rally but that his previous comments indicate he was designated to ""lead a march to the Capitol, where President Trump would meet the group."" The committee acknowledged specifically that once at the Capitol, Jones told people ""not to be violent"" and to gather and wait for Trump to speak. Even though Trump never came to the Capitol, the committee said the location where Jones told people to wait ""coincided"" with the same place that ""Stop the Steal"" rally organizer Ali Alexander obtained a permit for that day. In March, CNN reported that police in Washington, DC, were investigating an allegation that Jones threatened to push another pro-Trump political organizer off of an event stage in December, according to people familiar with the incident.The allegation was filed with DC police by Kylie Jane Kremer, executive director of the organization Women for America First, a group that helped organize a series of post-election rallies, including one in a park south of the White House that preceded the Capitol riot on January 6.Kremer was previously subpoenaed by the select committee. The alleged threat occurred outside the Willard InterContinental hotel, located about two blocks from the White House, according to the police report. The Willard served as an election-related ""command center"" for Trump allies around January 6, and the committee has expressed significant interest in learning more about what was happening there at that time.   Taylor Budowich In its subpoena letter, the committee said Budowich ""reportedly solicited a 501c(4) organization to conduct a social media and radio advertising campaign encouraging attendance at the January 6th Ellipse rally and advancing unsupported claims about the result of the election."" The committee cited information on file with the panel to claim that Budowich directed approximately $200,000 from a source or sources to the 501(c)(4) that was ""not disclosed to the organization to pay for the advertising campaign.""Budowich was a senior adviser for the Trump 2020 campaign, specifically working with Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle. He is a longtime right-wing political operative, working as senior communications adviser for Ron DeSantis during his successful campaign for governor of Florida in 2018 and once served as executive director of the Tea Party Express.The committee might have particular interest in Budowich's connection to Guilfoyle. The former Fox News personality played a big role in the planning and preparation of the January 6 rallies. The committee also cited Wren as potentially being ""involved in facilitating the transfer of some or all of those funds"" that the committee claims Budowich is connected to.CNN has reached out to Budowich for comment. Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence In its subpoena letter to Stockton, the committee cited press reports to claim that he was among the group of rally organizers who communicated with Trump and other White House officials, including Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has been in an emerging standoff with the committee over his subpoena. The committee claimed that Stockton was among those who warned the White House of the possible danger from an unpermitted march that would reach the Capitol while Congress was certifying election results, and that Stockton specifically expressed his concerns to Katrina Pierson, a former Trump campaign official reportedly involved in the organization of the January 5 and January 6 rallies who served as a liaison between rally organizers and the White House. The committee said Pierson, who has also been subpoenaed, told Stockton and fellow rally organizer Amy Kremer, who has also been subpoenaed, that she would relay that information to Meadows.Stone, Jones, Stockton and Lawrence also have longstanding ties to Trump ally Steve Bannon, who is awaiting trial on contempt of Congress charges stemming from his refusal to cooperate with a subpoena from the committee. Both Stockton and Lawrence were involved in Bannon's ""We Build the Wall"" crowdfunding group, and in August 2020, federal agents raided their recreational vehicle in Mesquite, Nevada, hours before prosecutors unsealed charges accusing others involved in the group, including Bannon.Stockton and Lawrence released a statement Monday evening saying they had expected the subpoenas, but added, ""We are concerned that the timing during the week of Thanksgiving, while most normal business is closed, is further demonstration that this committee is not acting in good faith.""""In the many months since January 6th we have granted many reporters and outlets extensive on-the-record interviews because we are committed to getting to the truth about what happened. We remain committed to that transparency and pray for the opportunity to share our experiences to the public without the taint of misinformation that has become customary,"" Stockton and Lawrence continued. Roger Stone Meanwhile, the origins of the ""Stop the Steal"" slogan can be traced to Stone, a self-described ""dirty trickster"" whose 40-month prison sentence for seven felonies was cut short by Trump's commutation last July. A combination of documents provided to the select committee, press reports and Stone's statements demonstrate how he not only promoted his appearance at a January 6 ""Stop the Steal"" event, but solicited donations for it and stated his purpose at the rally was to ""lead a march to the Capitol,"" according to the panel's subpoena letter to him. The committee added that, according to media reports, Stone used members of the Oath Keepers as personal security guards, several of whom stormed the Capitol and at least one who has been indicted, while he was in Washington.Stone told CNN affiliate KOKI Monday night, ""I would probably assert my 5th Amendment right, decline to be interviewed.""In a statement earlier Monday responding to the subpoena, Stone called the allegations ""categorically false."" ""I have said time and time again that I had no advance knowledge of the events that took place at the Capitol on that day. Any statement, claim, insinuation, or report alleging, or even implying, that I had any involvement in or knowledge, whether advance or contemporaneous, about the commission of any unlawful acts by any person or group in or around the U.S. Capitol or anywhere in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021, is categorically false,"" he said.Stone was involved in the ""Stop the Steal"" movement's rise to prominence around the 2020 election. Along with Bannon and Jones, he was among the most notable voices pushing conspiracy theories in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election.At the time, Stone appeared on Jones' far-right radio show to trumpet groundless claims that Joe Biden was trying to steal the election, and Bannon echoed similar conspiracy theories on his podcast, calling the election ""a mass fraud.""Following the last major House inquiry into election integrity, after the 2016 election, Stone was convicted in federal court of obstructing Congress and telling five lies, about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks on behalf of the Trump campaign. He had sat for a more than a three-hour interview in 2017 with a Republican-led House committee. At his criminal trial, which occurred before the end of the Trump administration, the Justice Department successfully argued Stone lied to Congress to protect Trump. Trump later pardoned him.This story has been updated with additional reporting. ",2
70," (CNN)President Joe Biden wants half the vehicles sold in the US to be electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids by 2030. But to reach that goal, not only do Americans need to start buying more electric vehicles, they need more charging stations to plug them into. EVs and plug-in hybrids accounted for just 2% of US vehicle production in 2020, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Part of the reason EVs have been slow to take off -- in addition to being expensive -- is the lack of charging infrastructure: there are currently only around 45,000 publicly available EV chargers in the US. The Biden administration's goal is to increase that number to 500,000, and it plans to do that, in part, using $7.5 billion in funding from the bipartisan infrastructure package the President signed last week. Though it's only half of what the White House initially proposed for EV charging, experts told CNN it will get the administration most of the way to its goal. A White House official also told CNN the administration expects the funding to catalyze more investment from businesses, utilities, and state and local governments.But EV advocates told CNN that if the White House really wants EVs to take off, it needs to be even more ambitious.""It's going to need to be a lot more,"" said Connor Morgan, a spokesperson for the Zero Emission Transportation Association. ""Questions remain on how many more -- that's going to depend on consumer behavior."" Fast or slow charging The infrastructure funding earmarked for charging stations has been divided up into two main components: money that will go directly to states and money for a grant program. Around $5 billion of it has been allocated to states over five years to establish an interconnected network of EV charging stations, and to ""facilitate data collection, access, and reliability,"" according to the infrastructure bill text. Large states are the biggest benefactors -- Texas and California, for example, are receiving $408 million and $384 million, respectively. In addition to the allocation, states are eligible to apply for grants from a pool of $2.5 billion. A spokesperson from the Department of Transportation told CNN it is developing guidance to administer the programs.Ultimately it will be up to the states to decide what kind of chargers to install and where to put them.  There's a big cost difference between DC fast chargers, which can charge a car to mostly full in 20-30 minutes, and L2 chargers, which can take hours. DC fast chargers are meant to be installed along highway corridors and at rest stops, while L2 chargers make more sense for homes, workplaces, restaurants and shopping centers, where people have time to step away from their vehicle. But the speed of a DC fast charger comes with a cost. They typically cost around $100,000, compared to around $6,000 for an L2, according to Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a senior resident fellow at the think tank Third Way. ""If it only costs $6,000, you can put a lot of plugs in,"" Hughes-Cromwick said, noting that states will have to find the right balance between the faster, more expensive chargers and the slower, cheaper ones. Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, told CNN that officials should also consider how to ensure access to charging stations is equitable. A 2019 DOE study found that 80% of EV owners charge in their own home, which is challenging for people who live in apartment buildings or multi-unit housing.  ""Pretty much everybody who has an EV has a charger at home,"" Becker said. For those who don't have home charging access, more charging stations ""will allow them to enter the EV revolution."" Beyond charging The infrastructure funding is a giant leap forward for charging stations, but key parts of Biden's EV agenda are still tied up in Congress. Democrats' economic package includes up to a $12,500 tax credit for purchasing an EV that's made in the US with union labor. It also contains more funding to upgrade electrical transmission -- which will be needed if half the cars sold in the US need to be plugged in. The House passed the package on Friday, but its fate is unclear in the Senate. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, has voiced opposition to providing tax credits for union-made vehicles, for example. And there are other challenges beyond the political battle. Morgan, the spokesperson for the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said as more Americans start to drive EVs, there needs to be a larger societal shift in how we think about fueling our cars.  Instead of driving until the tank is empty and then stopping to fill up, Morgan said EV drivers need to think about refueling whenever they're parked and close to an available charger. He said Biden's infrastructure funding will help make those chargers more accessible. ""You fill up a little bit wherever you have access to a charger,"" Morgan told CNN. ""The societal shift will have to come."" ",2
71," (CNN)More than three months after he resigned in disgrace, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo exists in political limbo -- not completely written off as a spent force, but sidelined as the campaign to replace him heats up.Cuomo, who for a decade ran the Empire State and its Democratic Party apparatus, left his perch in August rather than face impeachment and removal from office following an inquiry by the state attorney general's office that found he sexually harassed multiple women and oversaw a toxic workplace. His departure capped a stunning fall from the national political stardom he achieved during the nightmarish first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Cuomo's handling of the crisis, lauded then, has since come under withering scrutiny. On Monday, the state assembly released a report of its own -- broader in scope than the attorney general's -- which concluded there was ""overwhelming evidence that the former Governor engaged in sexual harassment"" and that Cuomo and his senior staff were ""not fully transparent regarding the number of nursing home residents who died as a result of Covid-19."" The misleading data, the investigators said, was then used by Cuomo to burnish his image in a now infamous book, which was written and promoted with the help of government staffers, that initially stood to make him about $5 million.Cuomo has denied the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, said he did not intentionally misstate the nursing home death count and insisted the book deal and publication process followed ethical norms.  But 18 months on from Democrats semi-seriously chewing over his presidential prospects, Cuomo is now the subject of a criminal complaint in connection to one of the harassment allegations and grand plans for an easy election to a fourth term in office -- one more than his father, the late former Gov. Mario Cuomo -- have been replaced by a grittier calculus.Animating Cuomo's refusal to recede into retirement, or at least lay low in the aftermath of his resignation -- which was ultimately prompted by a state legislature that was poised to impeach, convict and remove him from office -- are twin struggles: to clear his name and, at the same time, make sure that New Yorkers do not forget it. 'I don't know that he is powerful, but I think he is feared'Today, Cuomo's public voice is mostly limited to his email list and Twitter account, a running feed of broadsides by his lawyer, Rita Glavin, and spokesman Rich Azzopardi against the investigation overseen by New York Attorney General Letitia James into Cuomo's alleged sexual misconduct. Cuomo frequently retweets sympathetic opinion articles, including a Newsday op-ed from September that described his downfall as an ""Albany coup d'état."" There's also a picture of the former governor and his dog, Captain, on a boat. For many in New York politics, from operatives to lawmakers, Cuomo's swapping of the executive chamber for an online echo chamber has been a welcome one -- and created a new dynamic they are keen to maintain.State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who represents a swing district in southern Brooklyn, described an ""era of good feelings"" on the Albany scene, with new Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul openly speaking about collaboration and partnerships with lawmakers who had largely been frozen out by the Cuomo team. But even in exile from the capitol, Cuomo casts a long shadow.""There's always the possibility of mischief and mayhem, especially with someone who is hellbent on retribution,"" Gounardes said, ""but I think that that will only get legs if we allow it to.""A Democratic consultant without ties to any of the gubernatorial campaigns underscored Cuomo's unique, if increasingly tenuous, hold on the party.""I don't know that he is powerful, but I think he is feared,"" she said. ""And there's power in that fear.""James' entry into the gubernatorial primary earlier this month, where she is widely regarded as Hochul's most formidable challenger, has been used by the former governor's small team as a means of seeking to undermine her office's report, which found that Cuomo had sexually harassed at least 11 women.Inside the campaigns, and in public comments on the trail, discussion of the former governor's future plans has been limited.  One Democratic operative who has spoken to multiple gubernatorial campaigns told CNN that Cuomo was a secondary issue in those discussions, with more tangible electoral issues -- like ""How is Brooklyn gonna go?"" -- taking up ""90% of the conversation.""""The one (Cuomo-related) variable that comes up is, 'What about the 18 million? Are we gonna see that 18 million? Are we going to see part of it? Where is that going to turn up?,'"" the operative said, referring to Cuomo's warchest. ""Because that's really the Cuomo question. He doesn't have a bully pulpit anymore. When he releases a statement, it gets less and less attention.""Azzopardi, Cuomo's spokesman, dismissed the chatter and insisted the former governor's only priority was to clear his name. ""Since the beginning of this ordeal, this has never been about politics for us it's been about getting to the truth,"" he said. ""There's a ton of idle speculation out there but we can't help it if we continue to occupy vital real estate in people's head.""A political comeback? One way for Cuomo to settle scores, re-enter political life in a more recognizable form and potentially raise even more money would be to launch a new campaign. Rumors about a potential bid for state attorney general, a job he held from 2007 to 2010, have been floating around for weeks. Though few are ready to fully dismiss the possibility, even some longtime Cuomo allies are doubtful.""When you're in a situation like (Cuomo's), I would imagine that you will continue to strive for not just relevance, but a role, and that's what he may want. Whether that's realistic at this time, or not, is something different,"" said Jay Jacobs, New York's state Democratic Party chairman. (Jacobs endorsed Hochul in October, when he said he last spoke to Cuomo.)There is also skepticism in some quarters over how deep Cuomo's pockets actually are -- or will be -- given his recent expenses.""I think he's got a lot less money than you and I think he has. Let's say he had 20 million or 19 million. He's now spent the last six months paying lawyers,"" said Chris Coffey, a New York political strategist and former co-campaign manager of Andrew Yang's mayoral bid. ""So I think he would be lucky to break double digits (millions), which is still a lot of money, but if you keep going at that rate, he's going to spend that money pretty quickly.""Monica Klein, a New York City-based progressive political consultant, said Cuomo's reliance on a barrage of alternately incendiary and inscrutable video and email statements underscored his difficult position.""This is a man who used his bully pulpit and the office of the governor to build and brandish his public image daily. Now, he can't rely on the constant coverage he once earned as the top state official,"" Klein said. ""There is no beat for 'former governor angrily tweeting from Westchester.'""Glavin on a livestream last week from Cuomo's website repeated a familiar series of accusations and demands, repeatedly expressing frustration that James had not engaged with the Cuomo team's public criticism or responded to its letters (before sending two more), and pointed to a recent New York Post report that amplified rumors about Cuomo's mulling a campaign as reason for James to recuse herself from further investigations into the former governor.""There's widespread speculation that the governor may run, may attempt a political comeback,"" Glavin said. ""I don't know what the answer to that is, but the very fact that there is speculation and people are talking about it, we have unnamed former advisors talking about it, means that it's in the head of anyone who's running for governor.""But the story cited by Glavin said ""several of Cuomo's confidants"" had been floating the idea, meaning she was effectively using a report fueled by allies of the former governor as fodder for attacking James. In a statement, James' office offered its sharpest rebuke to date, deriding the press conference as ""dramatics"" and ""faux outrage.""""To be clear, we stand by the report into multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Andrew Cuomo and, more importantly, we stand by the women who were brave enough to come forward and speak truth to power,"" a spokesperson said. ""If Andrew Cuomo didn't want to be accused of sexual harassment, he shouldn't have sexually harassed multiple women in the first place.""",2
72," (CNN)The Biden administration is asking the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals to wipe away an order from another appeals court blocking its Occupational Safety and Health Administration vaccine mandate. Several lawsuits were brought challenging the OSHA mandate, and last week the cases were consolidated in the 6th Circuit, an appeals court that leans right, as 10 of its 16 active judges are Republican appointees. But, before the cases were consolidated, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals -- perhaps the most conservative appeals court in the country -- issued its order blocking the mandate. In its filing overnight Tuesday, the Biden administration said the 5th Circuit erred in how its interpretation of the Occupational Safety and Health Act limited the law's reach, while also arguing that the 5th Circuit had not taken into proper account the public health interest in letting the mandate go into effect. ""Simply put, delaying the Standard would likely cost many lives per day, in addition to large numbers of hospitalizations, other serious health effects, and tremendous expenses,"" the administration said in the new filing. ""That is a confluence of harms of the highest order."" The OHSA policy, which was formally unveiled earlier this month, mandates that companies with 100 or more employees require that employees are either vaccinated or wear facing coverings while undergoing regular Covid-19 testing. The administration told the 6th Circuit that if it does not lift the order blocking the mandate, it should at least modify the 5th Circuit order ""so that the masking-and-testing requirement can remain in effect during the pendency of this litigation."" The latest request from the Biden administration comes after several of the parties challenging the mandate asked for the case to be put directly in front of the full 6th Circuit Court. Typically, such cases are first heard by a three-judge appellate panel, where, in theory, the Biden administration could draw a panel that is made up of a majority of Democratic appointees who are sympathetic to its arguments. So, skipping that step and sending the case to the full, right-leaning would increase the odds that the challengers would get a ruling in their favor.",2
73," (CNN)More than a dozen families for the victims of the Parkland, Florida, high school massacre have reached a settlement with the Justice Department in connection with a lawsuit they filed after the FBI failed to act on tips warning about the shooter, according to a court filing on Monday. After three years of litigation, ""the parties hereby advise the Court that they have reached an agreement to settle all of the claims at issue,"" according to the joint notice of agreement to settle the federal lawsuit filed on Monday. The Justice Department will pay $127.5 million to the families, according to a source familiar with the case. On Valentine's Day 2018, Nikolas Cruz entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and murdered 17 students and faculty members and injured 17 others. According to the lawsuit, the FBI received tips about Cruz's violent behavior, mental instability, and a large purchase of firearms, yet failed to intervene. Cruz pleaded guilty to the shooting in October and faces the death penalty in an upcoming sentencing hearing. Kristina Infante, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that while the financial details are currently confidential, it is an ""historic"" settlement and ""the culmination of the Parkland families' long and arduous efforts toward truth and accountability.""""It has been an honor to represent the Parkland families who, through their immeasurable grief, have devoted themselves to making the world a safer place,"" Infante said. ""Although no resolution could ever restore what the Parkland families lost, this settlement marks an important step toward justice.""The Justice Department declined to comment beyond the filing.In a motion filed in October, the Justice Department said that the families' ""causation theory is based on pure speculation that special agents in the Miami Field Office would have been able to prevent Cruz from committing his heinous act. Not only is such a theory speculative, but it necessarily relies on an impermissible stacking of inferences regarding how an investigation would have led to the prevention of the crime.""In a separate lawsuit, more than two dozen survivors of the massacre and families of the victims reached a $25 million settlement in October against the Broward County School Board. The agreement will not include any admission of wrongdoing by the school board, David Brill, an attorney in that lawsuit, told CNN.This story has been updated with additional reporting Monday.",2
74,"Washington (CNN)Two lawyers who went to court to claim voter fraud after the 2020 election must pay nearly $180,000 to the defendants they sued, a federal magistrate judge ordered Monday, saying their lawsuit aimed to ""manipulate gullible members of the public and foment public unrest."" The order from Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter of the US District Court in Colorado adds to the federal judiciary's condemnations of attempts by attorneys supporting then-President Donald Trump to use the courts to vet right-wing conspiracies in the days after the presidential election.Attorneys Gary D. Fielder and Ernest John Walker will have to pay attorneys fees of $50,000 to Facebook (now Meta), about $63,000 to Dominion Voting Systems, about $63,000 to the non-profit Center for Tech and Civic Life, more than $6,000 to the state of Pennsylvania and nearly $5,000 to the state of Michigan.   ""They need to take responsibility for their misconduct,"" Neureiter wrote in his order, adding that the lawsuit defamed the defendants.He continued: ""I believe that rather than a legitimate use of the legal system to seek redress for redressable grievances, this lawsuit has been used to manipulate gullible members of the public and foment public unrest. To that extent, this lawsuit has been an abuse of the legal system and an interference with the machinery of government. For all these reasons, I feel that a significant sanctions award is merited.""The lawsuit from late December 2020 was an attempt to create a class action challenge to the election on behalf of American voters, including eight named plaintiffs. Neureiter previously wrote a scathing 68-page opinion condemning the post-election lawsuit.The plaintiffs had no lawyers or experts that were able to support their claims of switched votes and government conspiracies, the judge noted, calling the lawsuit itself ""one enormous conspiracy theory.""Neureiter's earlier ruling was the first major consequence in federal court to befall lawyers and litigants who pushed Trump's attempt to undermine the 2020 election result in court. Other courts are still considering penalties for other lawyers involved in the failed pro-Trump lawsuits.In August, a federal judge in Michigan sanctioned pro-Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, as well as several other attorneys, ordering them to reimburse the attorneys' fees that the city of Detroit and Michigan state officials paid in seeking the sanctions. The judge said the lawyers, who worked on Trump-aligned lawsuits seeking to challenge election results, had ""engaged in litigation practices"" that were ""abusive and, in turn, sanctionable.""",2
75," (CNN)The inflation narrative is largely set. The coronavirus pandemic created supply chain snarls. It put production out of whack. As demand has roared back following Covid-19 lockdowns, prices have soared.A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. But there's a big problem with that narrative: It may not be the whole story.As The Wall Street Journal reported last week, corporate America is helping fuel the inflation madness in order to make more money.""Executives are seizing a once in a generation opportunity to raise prices to match and in some cases outpace their own higher expenses, after decades of grinding down costs and prices,"" write Kristin Broughton and Theo Francis.Most of the largest US companies are making more than enough money to account for inflation, they write, citing profit margins at many large US companies that are well above 2019 levels.Companies complain of not being able to find workers and having to deal with the supply chain problem -- but if they are also building bigger profits behind inflation, that's enough to aggravate even the biggest supporter of free markets.The Washington Post reported this weekend that the White House is considering turning a more circumspect eye toward corporate America, perhaps to deflect the political heat President Joe Biden has taken for the economy's performance.""Republicans have blamed the inflation problems on Biden's economic agenda, but there are signs that the White House could soon push back more forcefully, saying that large corporations are partly to blame for the dramatic increase in costs,"" writes Jeff Stein for the Post.He suggests this is an idea under consideration, but there are already some indications Biden will take a tougher view. Last week, he called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the oil and gas industry for price gouging as the cost of fuel shoots up.The industry's lobbying group called it a distraction and said Biden should be encouraging more domestic oil and gas production.The Biden administration earlier this year said the consolidation of the industry into a few main players, along with pressure from the pandemic, made pork prices shoot up. They have not fallen. The administration is looking to apply antitrust laws. The pork industry is frustrated by a new animal welfare law in California and says those costs are being passed to consumers.There are complicating factors for every industry.It's weather in Brazil behind inflation in coffee prices. It's the chip shortage influencing auto prices.It's OPEC behind gas prices.Inflation is temporary. But temporary is a relative term. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, recently wrote in a CNN piece that all the price increases have added nearly $200 per month in living expenses for a household making the median income.He guessed inflation won't go away today or tomorrow, but that it will slow relatively soon.""A year from now, as the pandemic recedes, inflation will be low enough that we won't be talking about it,"" according to Zandi. ""The hair-on-fire discourse over high inflation is understandable, but it's overdone.""A year can be an eternity. But let's say inflation is in the news for another year. That gets us through a congressional election in which Republicans are already at a historic advantage.The Democratic economist Larry Summers, who has been something of an inflation hawk, warns in The Washington Post that inflation, specifically, could lead to a second Donald Trump presidency.""Excessive inflation and a sense that it was not being controlled helped elect Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and risks bringing Donald Trump back to power,"" Summers wrote in a November 15 column for the Post. ""While an overheating economy is a relatively good problem to have compared to a pandemic or a financial crisis, it will metastasize and threaten prosperity and public trust unless clearly acknowledged and addressed.""As inflation mounts, Biden stays with Powell at the Fed. What then should we make of Biden's decision to renominate Jerome Powell to serve as the chairman of the Federal Reserve? Powell has been much more in the ""inflation-is-temporary-let's-not-overreact"" camp.He will see opposition on both sides of the aisle as a Senate confirmation vote approaches. Originally nominated by Trump, Powell ultimately found himself the subject of the then-President's attacks for not lowering interest rates enough to his liking. While Powell has repeatedly acknowledged the problem of income inequality and urged the government to address it, he has angered liberals for not being strong enough on Wall Street regulations.Powell is a ""dangerous man to head up the Fed,"" according to Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who said in September she would oppose a second term for Powell. She views him as an anti-regulation Republican.CNN's Paul R. La Monica writes that Biden's pick shows he ""learned a valuable lesson from his former boss (Barack Obama) about continuity over partisan politics during challenging economic times.""Biden nodded to progressives by nominating Lael Brainard to be the Fed's vice chair, but keeping Powell shows he's tuned in to economic stability as the top issue of his presidency.""If inflation is a political liability for Biden, then that favors continuity at the Fed,"" Ed Campbell, a portfolio manager and managing director at PGIM Quantitative Solutions, told La Monica.What can the Fed do to fight inflation? Raise short-term rates. CNN's Chris Isidore writes that the Fed slashed rates during the pandemic and bought assets to put more cash into the economy, which helped keep markets from plunging.But the moves also may have driven inflation. ""Powell critics argue that helped fuel the largest rise in consumer prices in 30 years and heavily inflated the value of assets like stocks and home prices — both of which have hit record levels this year,"" writes Isidore.Acting on gas prices. Biden hopes to announce a decision Tuesday to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to CNN's reporting. It could have a limited effect on controlling gas prices but is among the direct actions Biden can take against inflation. It's not clear if he'll go the extra step of banning US oil exports, as some Democrats have urged.There's one anti-inflation tool Biden hasn't used. There aren't too many things Biden can do about inflation. He's used executive action to help ease supply chain issues at ports and asked for accountability from the oil and gas industry. But he doesn't control the Federal Reserve, so he can't just raise interest rates. There is one thing he could do, but hasn't, writes CNN's John Harwood, and that's end tariffs placed by Trump on Chinese imports.Why not simply do it? Politics. ""The reason to do this or not to do this should not be inflation,"" Richard Haass, a top State Department aide under President George W. Bush who now heads the Council on Foreign Relations, told Harwood. ""The impact on US-China relations, and the domestic politics of US-China relations, would be larger than any impact on inflation.""The tariffs have cost American consumers and failed to revive American manufacturing. But even though they've failed as an economic measure, reinstating them might cost Biden too much politically, writes Harwood. Ending tariffs without getting something in return would only encourage Republican accusations that the President has been soft on China. Republicans are likely to accuse Biden of many things, however. One major thing they accuse him of these days is driving inflation.",2
76," (CNN)A federal judge took aim at former President Donald Trump on Monday for lying about voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election, saying that former Vice President Al Gore had a better standing to challenge the 2000 election results but that he was ""a man"" and walked away.""Al Gore had a better case to argue than Mr. Trump, but he was a man about what happened to him,"" Senior District Judge Reggie Walton said of Gore's decision to end his presidential bid following weeks of legal battles. ""He accepted it and walked away.""The comments from Walton came during a plea hearing for Capitol riot defendant Adam Johnson, who was photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern through the Capitol building. He pleaded guilty on Monday to a low-level charge of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds.""What concerns me, sir, is that you were gullible enough to come to Washington, DC, from Florida based on a lie,"" Walton said, ""and the person who inspired you to do what you do is still making those statements, and my concern is that you are gullible enough to do it again.""Walton, who was appointed by the man who defeated Gore, former President George W. Bush, is the most recent to add his voice to a chorus of judges criticizing Trump for lying to his supporters. Last week, a federal judge also suggested Trump had some responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and called the rioters ""pawns"" who were provoked into action. Johnson, 36, told Walton that he accepted responsibility for getting ""caught up in the moment,"" and said that a ""hard couple of years"" led him to spend a lot of time ""listening to a lot of information and reading things"" online.Investigators identified Johnson days after he was photographed smiling and waving as he carried the lectern through the Capitol building on January 6. According to prosecutors, Johnson started running to the Capitol building from the ""Stop the Steal"" rally at the Ellipse after someone in the crowd shouted ""Pence didn't do it!"" Johnson admitted that he brought a knife with him to Washington, but discarded it in the bushes on his way to the Capitol.Once inside the building Johnson wandered around until he came across Pelosi's office suite. He jiggled a door handle, prosecutors say, but it was locked. He then grabbed the lectern and carried it to the Capitol rotunda, posing for several pictures along the way. After he had discarded of the lectern, Johnson joined a crowd attempting to breach the House chamber. At one point, according to the plea agreement, Johnson said that a nearby bust of George Washington would be a ""great battering ram"" to get through the doors to the chamber. During the hearing, Johnson revealed that he may write a book about his involvement in the riot. He agreed that the government can seize any money he makes publicizing the event for the next five years as part of his plea deal.Johnson was originally charged with three federal crimes including theft of government property, but those charges will be dropped as part of his plea deal. He could face a sentence of up to six months in prison, according to his agreement with prosecutors read at his plea hearing on Monday. He will also pay $500 in restitution for damage done to the Capitol during the riot.More than 130 defendants have pleaded guilty so far to charges connected to the Capitol riot, with most to date admitting to misdemeanor charges.Man who organized bus travel sentenced to 60 days in jailFrank Scavo, who told local news outlets and the FBI he organized several buses to bring people from eastern Pennsylvania to Washington for the January 6 rally, was sentenced to 60 days in jail on Monday and received the maximum fine of $5,000.The sentence, handed down by Senior DC District Judge Royce Lamberth, was much heavier than the 14 days of incarceration that the Justice Department had asked for. Scavo pleaded guilty to illegally demonstrating in the Capitol, a misdemeanor offense, in September.Before issuing the sentence, Lamberth told Scavo he gave him ""credit for the fact that you did not put anyone at risk"" or engaged in violence but said that ""without you and other people"" the attack on the Capitol ""would not have happened.""Scavo told the judge he had a ""deep sense of regret"" for his actions on January 6, adding later that ""it was a crime.""""From the point the jig was up, you've done everything you could,"" Lamberth told Scavo in a brief comment following the sentence. ""Good luck to you.""According to the Justice Department, Scavo had captured assaults on Capitol Police officers while filming on his phone and bragged about ""storm(ing)"" the Capitol. On his Facebook page that day, Scavo posted that ""PENCE IS OUT OF CAPITOL"" and ""No certification Today!!!""""He had more or less a front-row seat"" to the Capitol siege, Assistant US Attorney Seth Meinero said during the hearing, adding that Scavo saw the crowd push into the east front of the Capitol after the Trump rally.",2

78,"Washington (CNN)The mysterious case of Rosemarie Hartle's vote in the last presidential election, three years after her death, was trumpeted in November 2020 by the Nevada Republican Party and various prominent conservatives. From then-President Donald Trump on down, Republicans used stories about phony votes cast under the names of dead people as key evidence for their claim that Joe Biden's victory was marred by major fraud. The Hartle mystery is now solved. And it turns out that the fraud was committed by a Republican.Hartle was married to Las Vegas businessman Donald Kirk Hartle, a registered Republican. In November 2020, Hartle told Las Vegas television station 8 News Now (KLAS-TV) that he felt ""disbelief"" when he found out that a mail-in ballot was submitted in his late wife's name. It was ""pretty sickening,"" he said at the time, adding that he didn't know how it could've happened.  But Hartle had actually cast the phony ballot himself. On Tuesday, Hartle pleaded guilty to the crime of voting more than once in the same election. The judge, 8 News Now reported, said Hartle had pulled what seemed like a ""cheap political stunt that kind of backfired and shows that our voting system actually works because you were ultimately caught."" Indeed. And it isn't the first time something like this has happened. In November 2020, the Trump campaign highlighted a case in which a ballot was cast in the name of a long-dead Pennsylvania woman. Her son later pleaded guilty to casting that ballot for Trump, saying, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, he had ""listened to too much propaganda and made a stupid mistake.""False or overstated claimsSo there is a smattering of confirmed cases in which ballots were indeed illegally cast in the names of dead people, and we might perhaps learn of some more cases over time. Early this year, Nevada's secretary of state referred 10 ""questionable"" cases to law enforcement for investigation. But Trump's vague assertions that thousands of ballots were cast in the names of dead people in various key states were entirely baseless; his massive numbers were plain fictional. Some specific ballots the Trump campaign claimed were fraudulent, meanwhile, were quickly proven to be legitimate ballots cast by living people with the same or similar names as dead people. And Republican voters were responsible for some of the small number of known crimes. A Republican local official was the perpetrator of one Ohio case, admitting to forging a signature to cast a ballot under the name of his recently deceased father; he told NBC News it was an ""honest error"" and also that he had simply been ""trying to execute a dying man's wishes."" In Colorado, a man who was charged in 2021 with murdering his wife, who had disappeared in May 2020, was also charged with illegally casting her ballot, for Trump, in the November election. He allegedly told FBI agents that he submitted the ballot because he thought ""all these other guys are cheating"" and his wife would have voted for Trump anyway. In some of the confirmed cases, including Hartle's, it is not publicly known which presidential candidate the illegal vote was cast for. Regardless, there is no sign that the crime of voting under the name of a dead person happened even close to frequently enough to have swung any state to Biden, that this crime was committed overwhelmingly by Biden voters, or that the crime is generally going unnoticed by the authorities.""No one claims that voter fraud never occurs. Multiple studies have examined the frequency of voting fraud, and it is extremely rare,"" said Paul Gronke, a political science professor and director of the Elections & Voting Information Center at Reed College. ""Voter impersonation fraud particular, which is what Mr. Hartle did when he forged his wife's name, is even rarer."" Gronke said that, while fraudulent voters can occasionally slip through verification systems if they are willing to commit a felony like Hartle did, ""nothing in this case is evidence that voting fraud is happening at a level that changes election outcomes.""The Nevada Republican Party did not respond to a CNN request for comment about how it had drawn attention to the Hartle case in 2020.Which is unsurprising. When it comes to voter fraud, some Trump allies have taken a distinctly Trumpian approach: throw sensational claims into the public realm before the actual facts are known -- and if inconvenient actual facts eventually emerge, just quietly move on to the next sensational claim, confident that the truth will never reach a good chunk of the Republican base.

79," (CNN)The Bidens are expected this week to revive a longstanding Thanksgiving family tradition that goes back to 1975, opting to spend this year's dinner in Nantucket, Massachusetts. In his 2017 memoir, "" Promise Me, Dad,"" Biden wrote that Thanksgiving was the first holiday he and his now-wife Jill spent together. The couple, and Biden's two young boys Hunter and Beau, had several invitations for Thanksgiving at the time. But Biden realized that ""no matter which family we chose (to spend the holiday with), we were going to hurt somebody's feelings, which was the last thing either Jill or I wanted to do.""""I was in my Senate office one day that fall, explaining this predicament to my chief of staff, and he said, 'What you need is a nuclear Thanksgiving.' Meaning the nuclear family alone. Only Wes Barthelmes was a Boston guy, so what he actually said was 'nucle-aah Thanksgiving,'"" Biden wrote. ""I wasn't sure what exactly he was trying to say, until he explained it might be easiest on everybody if the four of us -- me and Jill, Beau and Hunt -- went away alone. He suggested the island of Nantucket, which was an hour by ferry south of Cape Cod. Neither Jill nor I had ever been there, but we decided to go ahead and make an adventure of it.""And so a new family tradition began -- and will continue Tuesday when now-President Biden and the first lady head to the island. They were slated to leave on Tuesday night after serving Thanksgiving meals at a local Washington, DC, non-profit organization with Chef Jose Andres.The original group of four has expanded to include the Biden spouses and grandchildren. And over the years, the family has been spotted at local holiday events, including participating in Turkey Trots, the town's Christmas tree lighting ceremony and the Cold Turkey Plunge. Whether it's a great year or a lousy year, Biden wrote in ""Promise Me, Dad,"" ""we put it all aside and celebrated Thanksgiving in Nantucket."" That annual trek to Massachusetts, he said, has been ""a constant in our grandchildren's lives from the time they were aware, and they made it clear how much it meant to them."" That tradition didn't stop when Biden became vice president during the Obama administration. But instead of a long drive north, the second family traveled via Air Force Two.The family opted not to visit Nantucket for Thanksgiving in 2015, which took place about six months after Beau Biden died. Instead, then-second lady Jill Biden opted to take the family to Rome for the holiday. Along with the many Biden family traditions that took place on Nantucket (like taking a family photo each year at a Sconset beach house that was swept away in recent years), Beau proposed to his future wife at the town's 2001 Christmas tree lighting and married her at a downtown church. The President also wrote in his memoir that as Beau's health was becoming reason for concern, his sons used a Nantucket trip to urge him to run for president in 2016. ""I knew there were plenty of good reasons not to run, and uncertainty about Beau's health was at the top. And I really suspected that my sons, whose judgments I had come to value and rely on, did not want me to put the family through the ordeal of a presidential campaign just now,"" Biden wrote. ""'Dad, you've got it all wrong,' Beau said when we settled down in the kitchen in Nantucket. 'You've got to run. I want you to run.' Hunter agreed: 'We want you to run,'"" he continued. In 2020, the Biden family also opted not to visit Nantucket for large family gathering on Thanksgiving because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, he and his wife spent the holiday at their home near Rehoboth Beach in Delaware with their daughter, Ashley, and son-in-law Howard Krein. ""Last Thanksgiving, for the first time, it was just four of us -- my wife and I, our daughter and my son-in-law,"" he said earlier in November. ""Later this month, our tables and our hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines.""Despite the yearly visits, Biden does not own a home on the island. It's not clear where the family will stay. The presidential visit is expected to have a large security footprint, but so far, local authorities largely appear unfazed by the high-profile arrival. Tom Rafter, who oversees operations at the Nantucket Memorial Airport, told the Boston Globe that each of his 34 full-time employees will be on hand next week to welcome Air Force One.But he added, ""I mean, we've have the Kardashians visit in the past, so the island is used to this type of thing."" In celebration of Thanksgiving this week, the President and the first lady visited military service members and their families at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.And before their departure to Massachusetts, the President and the first lady will participate in a service project on Tuesday in Washington, DC, alongside the second family.",2
80,"New York (CNN Business)President Joe Biden on Monday formally announced his intent to nominate Jerome Powell to serve as the chairman of the Federal Reserve for a second term and nominate Lael Brainard to serve as the Fed's vice chair.Powell's four-year term is up in February, and the President faced a key decision of whether to keep Powell, who was put in the job by a Republican, in the government's most important economic policy job. At a time when rising consumer prices, inflation and shortages caused by the supply chain crisis are urgent concerns of the White House, there has been heightened focus on who the President was going to pick to lead the nation's central banking system. The White House cited Powell's ""steady leadership"" amid the economic turbulence of the pandemic as a reason for the decision. The Powell-led Fed took a series of unprecedented steps in March and April 2020 that helped ensure the Covid recession did not morph into a full-blown depression.Economic recovery, the White House said in a statement, ""is a testament to the success of the President's economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America's economy back on track.""Biden expressed his ""full confidence"" in Brainard and Powell in a statement.""I'm confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard's focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before. Together, they also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system,"" Biden said.Tough road aheadAssuming he gets confirmed by the Senate, Powell faces a very challenging situation in his second term at the helm of the Fed. The United States is grappling with its first inflation scare in decades, parts of the economy remain scarred by the worst pandemic in a century and the Fed's credibility has been called into question by a trading scandal. Although Powell seemed to put out the fire over the insider trading scandal with tough new ethics rules, inflation looks like the trickiest obstacle facing the Fed over the coming months. Up until very recently, the Fed has kept its foot firmly on the pedal, with rock-bottom interest rates and a massive bond buying program stimulating the US economy and financial markets. That's despite the fact that inflation is surging, hiring is booming and the housing market is arguably hotter than ever before. Although managing inflation is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, sticker shock is coming at a political cost to Biden, whose poll numbers have taken a hit in recent months as voters get more worried about the economy.""All Americans are feeling inflation,"" Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Minneapolis Fed, told CNN. ""Biden is saying, 'I am trusting my political future in this Fed leadership. I trust them to get inflation under control.'"" By keeping Powell in charge, the White House is signaling support for the central bank's view that inflation is a temporary phenomenon, albeit one that has lasted longer than the Fed anticipated.But there was little evidence Biden was seriously considering a Fed chair who would be much more aggressive on inflation. Brainard, who ultimately did not get the top job, has monetary policy views more or less in line with Powell's.""It's not like Brainard is a stealth hawk,"" said Kocherlakota.Indeed, Goldman Sachs said Monday after the Powell news that it continues to expect the Fed to only gradually lift interest rates, beginning in July. Why Biden picked PowellBy sticking with Powell, the Fed is opting for continuity and confirmability. Not only has Powell garnered the support of Republicans and moderate Democrats, he is well respected on Wall Street and investors are very comfortable with his communication strategy. Switching to a new face risked adding uncertainty to the confirmation process that could have rattled markets. And it would have added complexity to the already difficult task of reassuring investors nervous about the Fed unwinding its emergency policies. ""After an atypically lengthy deliberation phase, the White House ultimately went with the safest choice,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG,. ""The Powell pick provides leadership continuity that the market always appreciates and should give the White House a victory via a quick and relatively painless confirmation process. ""By choosing Powell, Biden is also sending a strong signal about the importance of an independent Fed, a norm that came under attack during the Trump era. Powell vs. BrainardBiden recently met with Powell and Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, separately at the White House as he weighed his decision, CNN previously reported. Brainard had been viewed as the leading contender if the President decided against Powell for a second term. ""This is a good decision,"" former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher told CNN. ""While Lael Brainard is a most capable economist, appointing her under pressure from progressive Senators like Elizabeth Warren would have sent a signal that the Fed has been overtly politicized, irreparably damaging its reputation for independence.""Powell has faced significant opposition from some progressive Democrats, who criticize his track record on financial regulation. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said at a recent Senate hearing that Powell was a ""dangerous man to head up the Fed"" and that he has ""regularly voted to deregulate Wall Street."" She said a Republican majority at the Fed under Powell's leadership could ""drive this economy over a financial cliff again.""""It's no secret I oppose Chair Jerome Powell's renomination, and I will vote against him,"" Warren said in a statement Monday. ""I will support the President's nomination of Lael Brainard as Vice Chair. Powell's failures on regulation, climate, and ethics make the still-vacant position of Vice Chair of Supervision critically important. This position must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement - and it needs to be done quickly.""Former Minneapolis Fed president Kocherlakota agrees that in recent years the Fed has undone a lot of the protections put in place to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. ""I feel strongly that we need a correction on that course,"" Kocherlakota said.Brainard has been much tougher on Wall Street, voting against some of the deregulatory steps the Fed has taken in recent years. Yet Biden ultimately decided against nominating Brainard to fill the open vice chair for supervision role, which would have put her in charge of overseeing Wall Street.But some key Democratic constituencies, such as organized labor, have signaled their support for him. Powell won Senate confirmation overwhelmingly for the position in 2018. Some progressives have also accused Powell of failing to do enough to address the climate crisis.Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said in a statement that he's ""disappointed"" in Biden's choice to keep Powell in charge of the Fed. ""I sincerely hope that, if confirmed, Powell will reassess his past opposition to utilizing the Fed's regulatory tools to minimize climate-related risks to the financial sector.""Trading scandalThe chair's renomination comes at a time of tumult on the Board of Governors and a trading scandal that had threatened to block Powell from being picked for a second term. The Fed recently unveiled sweeping changes to its ethics practices in response to the scandal about personal stock trading by then-regional Fed Presidents Robert Kaplan and Eric Rosengren, who led the Dallas and Boston Feds, respectively. Both Kaplan and Rosengren announced early retirements amid criticism about their trades. Powell, a Republican, was nominated to the Fed's Board of Governors by then-President Barack Obama. He was elevated to chair by then-President Donald Trump in November 2017 to succeed Janet Yellen, who is now Biden's treasury secretary. His term as a member of the Board of Governors doesn't expire until January 2028. He has been leading a widespread emergency market rescue in response to the economic crisis that followed the coronavirus pandemic. Though the US has made considerable gains -- its economy beat expectations and added 531,000 jobs in October -- there are still millions of people sitting on the sidelines of a tight labor market.

81," (CNN)President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden traveled to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on Monday afternoon to hold a ""Friendsgiving"" celebration with military service members and their families. ""I want to thank not only the warriors, I want to thank your family because they stand and wait,"" Biden said at Fort Bragg. ""I know how hard it is to have someone that's not at the table on a holiday, that are in harm's way, find themselves out of the country.""He recounted his late son Beau's service in Iraq and work in Kosovo, and called US service members the ""finest in the world.""""That's not hyperbole. You literally are,"" Biden continued. ""You're the finest the world has ever seen. And I'm so damn proud to be associated with you, and it's hard for me to even say it, but the thing that's amazing to me is how proud I am to be your commander-in-chief. You are the most incredible group of women and men, warriors that we've ever seen.""The first lady said they were both ""so grateful"" for everything the service members and their families do. ""Joe and I feel like, you know, you're family to us, and we cannot thank you enough,"" she said.The first couple, donning kitchen aprons emblazoned with the presidential seal, served food to group of some 250 attendees, which included elected officials, service members, and family members of deployed soldiers. The President served stuffing and the first lady served mashed potatoes. The first couple's visit was part of the Joining Forces initiative -- a White House effort to support military personnel, their families and veterans.Earlier this month, Jill Biden joined former Sen. Elizabeth Dole, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough for a Joining Forces event at the White House highlighting military caregiving families ahead of Veterans Day. The initiative was started in 2011 by Jill Biden and then-first lady Michelle Obama. On Tuesday, the Bidens will participate in a Thanksgiving service project alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff in Washington. Afterward, the Bidens are expected to travel to Nantucket, Massachusetts, where they'll spend Thanksgiving with family.This story has been updated with remarks from President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden.

82," (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff achieved another first in their historic roles when they affixed a white mezuzah to the right-hand side of the doorway of the vice presidential residence.The moment the sacred object was affixed to the Naval Observatory's wooden entryway marked the first time an executive home has carried the abiding sign of sanctity of a Jewish home, according to Rabbi Peter Berg of Hebrew Benevolent Congregation (The Temple) in Atlanta, which loaned the mezuzah. Berg led the private ceremony at the Naval Observatory in October.Emhoff is the first Jewish spouse of a president or a vice president, and Harris is the first woman and first woman of color to hold her title.""It's an extraordinary moment in United States history,"" Berg told CNN in an interview. ""And it was one of the great honors of my lifetime to be able to stand there with the second family as they placed that mezuzah on their home for the very first time.""A mezuzah houses a small scroll that includes text of the Shema prayer, and fulfills the biblical commandment to affix the object on the doorpost of the home, a White House official told CNN. It signifies protection for the home, marking it as a sacred and holy space, and a reminder for those inside ""to devote themselves to lives of meaning, value, kindness and love for all beings.""In attendance were Emhoff's parents, who had not seen their son or Harris in person since before the inauguration because of the Covid-19 pandemic.""Both the second gentleman and the vice president spoke off the cuff about what it meant to them to be standing here. Remember, this was not a public event. There were no cameras and no staffers there. There weren't Jewish elected officials. It was just a private family moment. And that to me is what made it so beautiful,"" Berg said. ""When I started talking, we all teared up because of the significance and the history,"" Berg said.Berg said October's ceremony, which he wrote, included two traditional blessings: one to sanctify the space and another to hang the mezuzah. A Shehecheyanu prayer was also recited, a ritual blessing said to sanctify ""something precious and new,"" per the official. The second family also participated in the reading to make the ceremony more personal.Emhoff eventually shared those personal moments publicly ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, posting photos of himself on Twitter in the process of hammering the sacred tube to the wall. One White House official said it sits roughly one-third of the way up.""One of my favorite memories was when our family visited and together, we hung a mezuzah on the front door of the Vice President's Residence,"" Emhoff wrote.This ceremony marks the latest way Emhoff and Harris have celebrated the second gentleman's Jewish faith during the first year in their new roles in the Biden administration. In March, Emhoff led the White House's first Passover event, live streamed for the masses days before the actual holiday. ""He obviously recognizes the significance of being the first in this space and I think he's very honored to have the opportunity to help lead some of these really important and significant traditions,"" a White House official told CNN in March.Harris herself has been a vocal advocate for the Jewish faith. Recently, she headlined the Anti-Defamation League's ""Never Is Now"" conference, offering a robust rebuke of antisemitism. And she met Israeli Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid in October.History made The Temple holds specific social justice significance, with long ties to the civil rights movement and the fight against antsemitism. Former Rabbi Jacob Rothschild's relationship with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led to Rothschild honoring the civil rights leader in Atlanta after he won the Nobel Peace Prize. The Temple was also home to Leo Frank, a Jewish man who was lynched in 1915. In more modern times, the Temple now works to reduce homelessness in the community with multiple shelters started by former Rabbi Sugarman.That work is what drew the second family to choose a mezuzah from the Temple, Berg said, as they wanted to be reminded of the virtues of the Temple upon returning home.The process started months ago when he received a call from an unknown number, with the caller saying they were looking to obtain a religious object for a ""high-profile couple"" who recently moved to Washington, DC.Berg first thought it was a prank call, before realizing the caller was referring to the vice president. After taking photos of the mezuzah and summarizing the Temple's lengthy history, Berg said he didn't hear back until months later -- in June when he was invited to attend a vaccination tour launch with Harris in Atlanta. Berg then spoke to Harris backstage.""They started to whisk me away because my 15 minutes were up and I said, 'By the way, don't forget about the mezuzah.' She looked up and said, 'If I told my husband once, I told him 100 times, we've got to get the mezuzah picked,'"" Berg said, recalling a moment of levity.He was told months later that the Temple had been chosen and was invited to DC for the ceremony.""The world is so filled with divisive politics, and this was just a beautiful ritual moment. Devoid of anything political, just pure beauty,"" Berg said.'Family is everything'The second family will affix a second mezuzah in the residence, from The Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life at the University of California Berkeley, according to the official.It's a sterling silver mezuzah, made after a design by Jewish American Sculptor Ludwig Yehuda Wolpert.""This mezuzah case has inscribed the Hebrew phrase, 'Blessed shall you be in your comings and blessed shall you be in your goings' (Deuteronomy 28:6), a traditional blessing for visitors and travelers,"" the official noted.Joel Goldstein, a vice presidential historian, summarized the significance of the historic moment to CNN as ""keeping with the ideal of pluralism and inclusivity that has been a hallmark of the Biden administration, as reflected initially by the selection of then-Sen. Harris to be his running mate and now in her service as vice president.""Tradition dictates that residents kiss the mezuzah as they walk into the home. During the ceremony, the question arose of whether to attach the cylinder either vertically or horizontally. Berg informed the family it's meant to be attached diagonally.""The reason why is because it reminds us of compromise and peace that should exist in the home. I explained that tradition to the second family and they felt it was just very deeply meaningful,"" Berg said.  ""And I remember the vice president even saying, 'Family means everything.'""",2
83," (CNN)The White House on Monday said that President Joe Biden intends to run for reelection in 2024, following a recent report indicating that the commander in chief and his staff are attempting to assuage concerns about his future political prospects. When White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked aboard Air Force One whether she could confirm if he was going to run again in 2024 and whether he was telling staff that, she responded, ""Yes, that's his intention.""The Washington Post reported over the weekend that Biden and members of his inner circle have been telling allies that he plans to run again -- an attempt to address concerns about whether he could commit to another presidential campaign given his age and ease worries Republicans returning to power.  A recent Quinnipiac University national poll showed that Biden's job approval rating sits at 36% -- the lowest number for the President in the so far in his presidency and the latest low in a months-long decline. And Democrats were pummeled in the November elections, adding to concerns about Democrats' chances in the 2022 midterm elections and Biden's vision of the future for the party. The President, who turned 79 over the weekend, has maintained that he wants to run again. In March, Biden told reporters during a news conference that it was his ""plan"" to run again. ""That is my expectation,"" the President said, adding that he doesn't typically plan that far in advance. The White House has also not indicated whether Biden would automatically endorse his choice for vice president, Kamala Harris, should he decide not to run. When asked whether Harris could expect the President's automatic endorsement if she decides to run for political office in either 2024 or 2028, Psaki said earlier this month, ""I don't have any predictions of whether she will run, when she will run. I will leave that to her."" ",2
84," (CNN)The White House on Monday announced that 95% of the federal workforce is in compliance with the Biden administration's vaccine mandate.""Ahead of tonight's deadline, the federal government has achieved 95% compliance, and 90% of the 3.5 million federal workers are already vaccinated,"" White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said during a press briefing, confirming previous CNN reporting. ""We are successfully implementing vaccination requirements for the largest work force in the United States with federal employees in every part of the nation and around the world.""CNN reported earlier Monday that over 90% of workers have received at least one shot and the other 5% have submitted exemption applications that were already approved or are pending, according to a senior administration official. More than 90% of those employees have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with the ""vast majority"" of that figure having received two shots, the official said.The announcement comes as the vaccine mandate for federal workers is set to go into effect by the end of Monday. Reuters was first to report on the vaccination rate.""The goal of vaccination requirements is to protect workers, not to punish them, so tonight's deadline is not an end point or a cliff,"" Zients said on Monday. ""We continue to see more and more federal employees getting their shot. And for the small percentage of employees who have not yet complied, agencies are beginning the education and counseling process.""Ninty-eight percent of employees at the Internal Revenue Service have complied with the rules, with around 25% of those employees getting their shots after the mandate was announced, Zients said. At the FBI, 99% of employees have had their shots, 98% of Customs and Border Protection employees are vaccinated, and 99% of employees at the Federal Aviation Administration are complying with the rules. Ninty-three percent of Transportation Security Administration employees have gotten their shots ahead of the holiday travel season.One source familiar with the data told CNN earlier Monday that the compliance figures have exceeded the administration's expectations.With more compliance submissions expected to come on Monday, federal departments and agencies will further process and review information and documentation regarding vaccinations in the coming days, the official said, and agencies will provide an ""education and counseling process"" for those who have not complied or those who do not have a ""pending or approved exception or (extension request)."" Additional enforcement steps could be taken over time if needed.The Office of Management and Budget will release a summary chart of agency data regarding compliance on Wednesday morning, the official said.Earlier this year, Biden imposed stringent new vaccine rules on federal workers, large employers and health care staff in an attempt to contain the latest surge of Covid-19, particularly after the emergency of the highly transmissible Delta variant. Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. Eighty-four million workers would be covered by the rules, which are scheduled to fully take effect on January 4.Immediately after being announced, the mandate came under challenge from Republican-led states and some private employers, who say the administration overstepped its authority in issuing such a rule. A federal appeals court put the mandate on hold. It is now before the conservative-leaning Ohio-based 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which could soon decide its fate.But many employers continue to implement vaccine mandates, regardless of whether the courts uphold or strike down Biden's requirements. Court decisions against mandates apply only to the government's rules, not to individual companies that have instituted their own vaccine requirements.Biden has also signed an executive order requiring all government employees be vaccinated against Covid-19, with no option of being regularly tested to opt out. The President signed an accompanying order directing the same standard be applied to employees of contractors who do business with the federal government.This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.",2
85," (CNN)President Joe Biden marked Transgender Day of Remembrance in a statement Saturday, paying tribute to ""those we lost in the deadliest year on record for transgender Americans.""In a statement shared with CNN, Biden also remembered ""the countless other transgender people -- disproportionately Black and brown transgender women and girls -- who face brutal violence, discrimination, and harassment.""On Friday, the White House marked the day with a vigil in the Diplomatic Room of the White House hosted by second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Transgender Day of Remembrance caps off Transgender Awareness Week, and memorializes victims of anti-transgender violence across the country. Earlier this month, the Human Rights Campaign declared 2021 the deadliest year on record for transgender and nonbinary people, with at least 45 transgender or gender-nonconforming people killed.In a tweet marking that solemn milestone, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the news ""unacceptable,"" writing: ""Our hearts are with all who knew and loved the 45 people who have been killed this year. The march to end this epidemic of violence continues.""In his statement, Biden called on the Senate to pass the Equality Act, which amends the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect people from being discriminated against based on sexual orientation and gender identity, ""so that all people are able to live free from fear and discrimination."" The bill passed the House in March but has stalled in the Senate.""In spite of our progress strengthening civil rights for LGBTQI+ Americans, too many transgender people still live in fear and face systemic barriers to freedom and equality,"" Biden wrote. The administration also released a report Saturday from the first Interagency Working Group on Safety, Opportunity, and Inclusion for Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals, which is made up of representatives from the US Agency for International Development, the Departments of State, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Education, Homeland Security, Labor, Interior and Veterans Affairs, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the US Interagency Council on Homelessness.Per the report, shared Friday with CNN, violence against transgender Americans is the direct result of ""systemic anti-transgender stigma and hate, pervasive discrimination, disproportionate criminalization, and marginalization and exclusion of gender minorities,"" with violence against transgender communities ""heightened today due to a historic spike in legislation targeting transgender people for discriminatory and unjust treatment.""President Barack Obama's White House regularly acknowledged Transgender Day of Remembrance and met with activists to discuss violence against the community. That practice did not continue under President Donald Trump.Biden's statement is the latest in a series of moves by the administration to show support for LGBTQ+ Americans, including reversing his predecessor's ban on transgender Americans in the military, reinstating a special envoy for LGBTQ rights after the position lapsed under Trump and issuing the first presidential proclamation marking Transgender Day of Visibility in March. The President drew praise from LGBTQ advocates for his remarks pledging support for transgender Americans during his first address to a joint session of Congress in April, while first lady Jill Biden invited Stella Keating, a teenage transgender advocate who testified before Congress in support of the Equality Act, as her virtual guest for the address.While violence against transgender Americans is at an all-time high, 2021 has also marked a record year for anti-transgender legislation, with state legislatures introducing 100 bills across 33 states aimed at curbing the rights of transgender people.The majority of bills would affect transgender youth, a group that researchers and medical professionals warn is already susceptible to high rates of suicide and depression.  ""To ensure that our government protects the civil rights of transgender Americans, I charged my team with coordinating across the federal government to address the epidemic of violence and advance equality for transgender people. I continue to call on state leaders and lawmakers to combat the disturbing proliferation of discriminatory state legislation targeting transgender people, especially transgender children,"" Biden wrote in Saturday's statement.  ""Today, we remember. Tomorrow -- and every day -- we must continue to act.""",2
86," (CNN)President Joe Biden underwent his annual physical Friday morning at Walter Reed Medical Center, his first such appointment since he was inaugurated as the oldest first-term president in US history.Afterward, his physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor wrote in a memo Biden ""remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.""The doctor, who has been with the President since he served as vice president, singled out two areas of ""observation"" he set aside for detailed investigation: an ""increasing frequency and severity of 'throat clearing' and coughing during speaking engagements"" and the President's ambulatory gait, or walking abnormality, which O'Connor said was ""perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago."" Both have been noticeable elements of Biden's public appearances since taking office. In a detailed, six-page summary of Biden's health, O'Connor said X-rays showed Biden has arthritis of his spine and normal wear and tear damage for someone of his age. The doctor characterized that damage as moderate to severe, but said it was not severe enough to warrant any specific treatment. He wrote it would help account for some of Biden's recent stiffness and clumsy gait. An ""extremely detailed neurologic exam"" was ""reassuring,"" O'Connor wrote, and showed no evidence of a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's.Biden also has a condition known as hiatal hernia, which causes him to have reflux -- something O'Connor said could account for his more frequent throat clearing.The document contained a detailed accounting of the physical exam, including his height of 5 feet 11.65 inches; his weight of 184 pounds; and his blood pressure of 120/70. Biden does not drink or use tobacco and works out five times a week, according to the report. ""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,"" O'Connor wrote in his summary.Biden received a routine colonoscopy Friday while at Walter Reed. The process, which required anesthesia, meant that he temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman to assume presidential power for 85 minutes Friday morning.As he left Walter Reed, Biden said he ""had a great physical and a great House of Representatives vote,"" alluding to the House passing his Build Back Better bill on Friday morning.The last extensive update on Biden's medical state came in December 2019, when the doctor he eventually recruited to serve as White House physician described him as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, hasn't released a full report on his health since.Biden is not behind in releasing medical information compared to his recent predecessors, who waited a full year before undergoing a physical and authorizing details to be released publicly.The latest update on Biden's health came after he, then-president-elect, fractured his foot in November while playing with his dog. In February, Biden's physician said the foot fractures ""are completely healed.""Presidents are not required to publicly disclose results of their annual check-ups but have done so to be transparent and assure the American people in the face of questions about their state of health. Presidents, however, have also hidden their illnesses, the severity of their illness, or medical treatments.Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009 and the White House physician, wrote the three-page medical summary Biden's presidential campaign released nearly two years ago. The 2019 summary showed Biden was being treated for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, or AFib -- an irregular heartbeat that O'Connor said Biden experiences no symptoms of. He was taking Crestor to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as Eliquis to prevent blood clots, Nexium for acid reflux, and Allegra and a nasal spray for seasonal allergies.The most significant medical event in Biden's history, O'Connor wrote, was when Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988. He was serving in the Senate at the time. During surgery, doctors found a second aneurysm that had not bled, which they also treated. While in the hospital after that surgery, Biden suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Doctors at the time inserted an ""inferior vena cava filter,"" which would prevent future blood clots from reaching the heart and lungs and treated him with an oral anti-coagulant for several months.Biden also had his gallbladder removed in 2003, and according to O'Connor he has had multiple surgeries and physical treatments for orthopedic injuries and sports medicine. Biden also has had several non-melanoma skin cancer lesions surgically removed. This story has been updated with additional information. ",2
87," (CNN)The White House will keep its mask mandate in place on its grounds even as Washington, DC, lifts its indoor mask requirement starting Monday, a contrast that highlights the uneven messaging many Americans are receiving on Covid-19.The nation's capital remains an area with ""substantial"" community transmission, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is currently at a rate of about 90 new weekly cases per 100,000 residents. That's led the White House to keep its strict masking rules in place even as the district around it starts to relax its own rules.""The White House follows CDC guidance, which recommends masking in areas of high or substantial transmission,"" Kevin Munoz, White House assistant press secretary, told CNN. But DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is bucking the CDC recommendations and announced last week the district would be relaxing its requirements, pointing to low hospitalization rates as a result of vaccinations. The reaction to this announcement was mixed, and some voiced concern about what it meant for the city's most vulnerable residents. The differing guidelines within the nation's capital reflect just how much mask requirements vary from place to place, and how many Americans are currently navigating a patchwork of mitigation efforts. It's a messaging problem the Biden administration has been fighting ever since the spring, when public health officials began to relax their recommendations to stop the spread of Covid-19 as cases dropped and vaccinations increased.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said this week that more than 85% of counties in the US have substantial or high transmission. She noted the CDC recommends jurisdictions have moderate or low community transmission for several weeks before rolling back mask requirements. Currently six states have statewide mask mandates: Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington, according to Hemi Tewarson, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. At one point earlier on in the pandemic, 30 states had similar mandates. Beyond the White House, an administration official tells CNN the mask policy in a federal building outside of Washington will be dependent on the level of transmission in the area where that building is situated.The President has long promised his administration will follow the lead of health and medical experts, making it no surprise the White House and the rest of the federal government are sticking with the CDC guidance. Biden came into office vowing to restore the CDC's independence, and has stressed there would be no interference on such issues by the White House. But the messaging from the CDC has sometimes caused confusion among Americans looking for answers on how to get through the pandemic. Most recently, there has been deep frustration inside the administration over the complicated messaging surrounding Covid-19 vaccination booster shots, with several officials telling CNN the restrictions on who should get one and when have only spurred confusion when it was clear immunity wanes for all age groups.The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines for all adults, which offers the Biden administration a fresh chance at simplifying that particular messaging. The CDC quickly followed suit, recommending that people 18 and older get boosters.Back in May, the country appeared to reach a turning point when the CDC said people who were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 didn't need to wear masks or practice social distancing indoors or outdoors, except under certain circumstances. Shortly after the guidance came out, the White House emailed staffers and said they did not need to wear a mask on the grounds if they are vaccinated. Biden said at the time it was a ""great day for America"" and a ""great milestone"" in the country's response to the pandemic. He credited the national Covid-19 vaccination program for that development.But as Delta variant cases spiked across the country in areas with low vaccination rates, the CDC changed its recommendations in July and urged people in certain areas of the country to resume wearing masks indoors in public areas. The White House and other federal buildings followed suit. After initially resisting imposing any kind of vaccine requirements and instead simply encouraging all Americans to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the White House has now taken a tougher stance. Biden has imposed stringent new vaccine rules on federal workers, large employers and health care staff. The new requirements could apply to as many as 100 million Americans, or close to two-thirds of the American workforce. As the pandemic dragged on and tens of millions of Americans still refused to get vaccinated, which fueled the spread of the virus and the Delta variant, the President hardened his tone towards unvaccinated Americans. ""We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,"" Biden said in September while announcing the new vaccine requirements. ",2
88," (CNN)President Joe Biden, reconvening a summit of North American leaders at the White House on Thursday, sought cross-border agreement on migration, Covid-19 and economic integration, even as his guests voiced concerns over what they say are protectionist trade policies left over from Biden's predecessor.""We can meet all of the challenges if we just take the time to speak with one another,"" Biden said as he met in the East Room with the leaders of Canada and Mexico. ""As leaders, we share an innate understanding that our diversity is an enormous strength.""The main sticking points between the men center on Biden's proposed tax credits for American-made electric vehicles, which are included in the major social and climate spending plan currently making its way through Congress. Canada has argued the proposed credits could violate a new North American trade agreement.The White House holds a different view, and the topic was expected to arise during the lengthy talks between the leaders at Thursday's gathering.It's the first such summit -- which have come to be known as the ""Three Amigos"" -- since 2016, reviving a forum shunned by former President Donald Trump. It came a few weeks after Biden reopened US land borders to fully vaccinated travelers, ending a nearly 20-month closure that had caused tensions with both nations.Before he met jointly with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Biden sat down with each leader individually to discuss bilateral issues. They did not hold a joint press conference, unlike the previous eight North American Leaders summits held since 2005.Welcoming Trudeau to the Oval Office, Biden offered praise for what he called ""one of the easiest relationships you can have as an American president, and one of the best.""With López Obrador, Biden hailed the two nations' ""different and emerging relationship, that is borne out of mutual respect.""""Mr. President,"" Biden went on, ""we no longer use language like 'Our friends from the South.' You are an equal, we're equal countries, and that's what I like about you.""All three leaders entered the talks hoping for a more united front on economic and security matters as global competition from China and other regions scales up. Supply chain disruptions have heightened the nations' desire to create more resilient manufacturing at home.The leaders were planning to announce a new group focused on supply chain resiliency, pledge to reduce emissions like methane and reaffirm support for labor protections included in the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal signed during the Trump administration.The leaders also hope to rebuild relationships that had gone dormant in the previous administration, including a high-level security dialogue.Yet as Biden works to promote the landmark infrastructure law he signed this week, some of the provisions included in a larger climate and social spending plan are causing consternation among the United States' neighbors.Specifically, proposed electric vehicle tax credits included in the ""Build Back Better"" plan would favor US manufacturers, causing concerns about protectionist policies. Trudeau and Mexican officials have voiced concern about the proposed tax credits.Pressed by reporters, Biden said alongside Trudeau the two leaders were ""going to talk about"" tax incentives for electric vehicles, but pointed out the provision ""hasn't even passed the House yet.""During a daily White House press briefing, the President's press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the proposed electric vehicle tax credit ""is an opportunity to help consumers in this country.""Migration was another central topic of discussion, though ahead of time Biden's advisers said the focus would be on developing a regional approach to the issue and not specifically about the US southern border.One official said Biden hoped to ""lock arms"" with Canada and Mexico to address displacement issues they acknowledge will not wane anytime soon. They hope to address root causes like lack of job opportunities and the effects of climate change.Other issues have caused some tension among neighbors, including Enbridge's Line 5 oil pipeline, which the state of Michigan wants to shut down, and Mexico's overhaul of its electricity industry.But the leaders still put on a cooperative face as the ""Three Amigos"" format was restored, including an announcement on Covid-19 vaccine donations. Earlier this year, the United States lent doses to both countries, and on Thursday they ""returned"" them by donating millions of vaccines to countries in the Western Hemisphere.They also agreed to build on efforts to compile regional pandemic preparedness plans and discuss the best ways to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine in Latin America.This story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.",2
89," (CNN)Potential pay outs of up to $450,000 to migrant families separated at the US-Mexico border are the latest political flashpoint in the Republican criticism of President Joe Biden's immigration policy -- and the political back-and-forth has put a tense relationship under further strain.The debate has not only put the Biden administration in a politically precarious position, but more acutely, Biden's response to the payments has stressed the already-fragile relationship between the government and families, according to immigrant advocate groups who work directly with them. After Biden swatted down media reports about financial compensation for those separated under the previous administration, the Justice Department told attorneys representing families who are seeking damages that settlement will not be that high, sparking confusion among attorneys and advocates about the Biden administration's position on the matter.""It does not help when there's a lack of clarity about what the federal government is willing to do for the families,"" said Nan Schivone, the legal director at Justice in Motion, which helps locate separated families.""When the news broke, it was not helpful because it sowed a lot of seeds of confusion about the willingness of the government to care for the families and atone for the past unlawful actions, the unlawful actions of the past administration,"" she added.Republicans have lambasted the administration for considering financial compensation for separated families, arguing in part that it should not exceed what's provided to the families of fallen soldiers. In a nearly four-hour congressional hearing this week, at least five Republican senators repeatedly raised the ongoing settlement negotiations in questioning of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who deferred to the Justice Department, which is handling the settlement negotiations. Mayorkas is the chair of the family reunification task force ordered by Biden. In recent months, tensions have also flared between the Biden administration and allies over the administration's border policy, but concern over the handling of remedies for separated families puts one of the most sensitive matters at the forefront. Behind the scenes, families at the center of the damages cases are still reeling over the moment more than three years ago when they were separated from their loved ones and are waiting for the Biden administration to execute on its promises. ""It's only been words. I can't have confidence in something like that,"" Daniel Paz, a father who was separated from his 7-year-old daughter at the US-Mexico border in May 2018, told CNN, in Spanish.  Paz reunited with his daughter, Angie, after seven weeks. And in June 2018, the Trump administration ended the so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy, in which the Justice Department initiated criminal prosecutions of every adult illegally crossing the border.Paz still gets emotional recalling the moment when officials took his daughter, along with other children, while at a border facility. ""The kids were yelling. ... We begged for them not to do it,"" Paz, a member of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, said. ""It was like a horror movie."" Paz, an asylee, is seeking damages from the federal government. More than 3,000 children were separated from their families at the US-Mexico border under former President Donald Trump and attorneys are still trying to reach the parents of 270 migrant children, according to a November court filing in an ongoing family separation case. For parents who experienced their children being taken from them, with no hint of where they were going, it's been difficult to trust the federal government, regardless of who's president. ""These families have very little reason to trust the US government based on their experience when they were separated and deported,"" said Wendy Young, president of Kids In Need of Defense, which has worked closely with separated families. ""You can't really underestimate the amount of trauma that these families have gone through. That fundamentally makes them very nervous and skittish,"" she added. KIND recently partnered with the United Nations refugee agency to target outreach to families and field questions or concerns they may have. Karla Emeli Portillo Molina is among those parents who were deported without their children. She was separated from her 14-year-old son in 2017 and sent back to El Salvador months later without him. ""I was crying. I became depressed. I didn't want to leave without my son,"" she told CNN in Spanish. She was reunited with her son, now 18, in California this year. The expediency with which her paperwork was completed and approved for her to reunite gave her confidence in the Biden administration. Lawsuits have stemmed from the ""zero tolerance"" policy and separation of families. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class action lawsuit in 2019 seeking damages for the toll the separations took on families, and attorneys representing families have filed separate claims. ""The statute doesn't have an immigration status exception and the federal government often settles lawsuits whether person is a citizen or non-citizen,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director at the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, adding that migrants can legally apply for asylum either at or between ports of entry at the US-Mexico border. ""Harm is harm. And Congress is clear you can't brutalize someone and then say, 'Well, they were here illegally.' The fact is these were asylum seekers,"" he told reporters Thursday, noting that there's no settlement deal on the table right now. The Biden administration's task force, meanwhile, has made some inroads, reunifying 60 families, with more anticipated. ""Establishing trust with families who were intentionally and cruelly separated under the prior administration's Zero-Tolerance policy is a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security, and is essential to the effort to reunify those families,"" a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. ""DHS recognizes the intense trauma these families have experienced, and is working closely with non-governmental organizations to take this trauma into account in the reunification process,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Mayorkas has previously met with families separated at the border under the last administration. That trauma extends to children, including Angie, Paz's daughter.""She doesn't play like she used to,"" he told CNN in Spanish. ""Now, she's worried with adult problems."" ",2
90," (CNN Business)Apple on Tuesday sued NSO Group and its parent company, accusing the Israeli firm of violating a federal anti-hacking law by selling potent software that clients have used to spy on Apple customers. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, alleges that NSO's spyware, known as Pegasus, and other malware have caused Apple monetary and property damages, and violated the human rights of Apple users along the way. ""To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,"" Apple said in a statement. In a statement Tuesday, NSO Group did not address the specifics of the lawsuit and instead said the firm's technology saves lives.NSO Group provides ""lawful tools"" to help governments fight pedophiles and terrorists, the firm said.While NSO Group has long maintained that it only sells its software to authorized users for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes, researchers have for years uncovered evidence that Pegasus has been used to surveil dissidents and human rights activists. Researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September said that an unidentified party was using Pegasus, and a vulnerability in Apple operating software, to spy on a Saudi activist. The lawsuit is the latest setback for NSO Group, which cybersecurity analysts and human rights activists have long accused of doing business with repressive governments. The firm's easy-to-use spyware is capable of eavesdropping on a phone's communications and accessing other sensitive data on the device, according to researchers. The US Commerce Department this month added NSO Group to its so-called ""entity list,"" effectively banning the company from buying software components from US vendors without a license. Commerce accused NSO Group, and another Israeli firm known as Candiru, of providing spyware to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target"" journalists, embassy workers and activists.In a statement at the time, NSO Group said it was ""dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed.""""We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world's most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based [on] the American values we deeply share,"" according to the statement, ""which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts [sic] with government agencies that misused our products.""Candiru could not be reached for comment at the time.Apple is at least the second major US tech firm to sue NSO Group. Facebook (now known as Meta) in 2019 sued NSO Group for allegedly facilitating the breach of 1,400 phones running the WhatsApp messaging application. NSO Group has denied the allegations made by Facebook, and tried to block the case from moving forward. But a US appeals court this month ruled that the lawsuit could proceed.Apple said it would contribute $10 million, plus any damages from the lawsuit, to ""organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.""The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages from NSO Group, as well as ""compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.""NSO Group is just one of several firms that sell specialized hacking tools to break into different types of mobile phones.  In its lawsuit, Apple's lawyers reflected on what it called a ""continual arms race"" between Apple engineers and NSO Group's code-writers.""Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades,"" the complaint states.",2
91,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Xiaomi stumbled in the third quarter as it grappled with fallout from the global chip shortage and fiercer competition.  The Chinese company, which only recently became the world's second-biggest smartphone maker, fell back to third place behind Apple (AAPL) in the three months ended September, according to Counterpoint Research and Canalys.Posting earnings on Tuesday, Xiaomi said that its smartphone business had been severely affected by the ongoing shortage of semiconductors, which it expects to continue through the first half of next year.""This year, there is a very special background, and that is there is a shortage of components globally,"" Wang Xiang, Xiaomi's president, said on an earnings call. ""The shortage is a big challenge to us.""The company logged 43.9 million global smartphone shipments in the third quarter of 2021, down about 6% compared with the same period last year.Xiaomi has called smartphones ""the cornerstone"" of its business, which includes other connected devices such as home appliances. Lately, the company has also announced a push into electric cars, with plans to mass produce its first vehicle in the first half of 2024. It excited investors this summer after leapfrogging Apple to become the world's second best-selling manufacturer. The Beijing-based company's shipments had soared in the three months ended June, trailing only those of Samsung (SSNLF). Setbacks on supplySince then, however, Xiaomi has been hit hard by supply chain woes.Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint, said that while component shortages had affected virtually every vendor, Xiaomi had to contend with bigger headaches due to its extensive lineup.In the most recent quarter, the company offered more than 50 different smartphone models, compared to about 14 that Apple had on the market, he estimated. That adds complexity and ""becomes challenging,"" said Pathak. ""Because you have to deal with a range of components.""A relative lack of exposure to the problem helped Apple, in part, reclaim the second spot in the race in the third quarter, he added. The US giant also benefited from strong iPhone 13 sales, according to Canalys Research. In a recent report, the firm estimated that Apple had nabbed 15% of global shipments, just one percent more than Xiaomi.But don't count Xiaomi out, according to Pathak.He said the firm could well reclaim its runner-up position, particularly as it usually performs strongly in the first half of the year, with upcoming events such as Chinese New Year.Xiaomi's ultimate goal — of eventually getting to number one — isn't out of the question either, according to Pathak.He said the company would need to retain its lead in two of its most important markets, China and India, while working to carve out a greater presence in places such as the United States. ""If they [become] number one, it can't be just because of these two countries,"" Pathak said. ""The US has the number three [smartphone] market in the world, which is largely missing from Xiaomi's portfolio.""Xiaomi posted overall revenue of 78.1 billion yuan ($12.2 billion) in the third quarter. That represented an 8% increase compared to the same time last year, but was slightly less than analysts were expecting. Net profit climbed 25% to nearly 5.2 billion yuan ($814 million) during that period, slightly higher than analyst projections.",2
92,"Washington, DC (CNN)The indoor cycling craze has come for America's kids, and child development experts aren't happy. Little Tikes, the children's toymaker, watched sales of Peloton's stationary bikes soar last year when the pandemic hit. It saw a chance to create something for children to enjoy alongside their parents, according to Little Tikes vice president of product development Kevin Bloomfield.  So this summer Little Tikes released the Pelican, a stationary bike for children ages 3-7, with a screen attached for viewing videos. Pelotons, the popular stationary bikes for adults, come with screens that can display exercise classes and add a social touch to exercising alone. (The bike costs $1,495 and there's a monthly membership fee of $39 to view video classes.) ""We didn't want the parents to be the only ones having all the fun,"" Bloomfield said in an email to CNN Business. ""Our commitment to inspiring an active and imaginative lifestyle among kids sparked the idea."" Stationary bikes have existed for kids before, but have not lasted. Toymaker Fisher-Price launched a $150 stationary bike for kids in 2007 and updated it in 2017. Fisher-Price then cut its price to cut its price to under $100 and now no longer sells the bike. It declined to explain why. The bike was sold exclusively on Amazon, which also declined to comment. But child development experts aren't having it. They say a stationary bicycle, especially one with a screen attached, is a step backward for what a bicycle can mean to child development. Kids riding a stationary bike lose the learning experiences that come from roaming their neighborhood on foot or on bike. ""It just feels so bogus to me. And it doesn't feel like something that kids will use a lot,"" Roberta Golinkoff, a University of Delaware professor who studies child development, told CNN Business. ""Kids want to be part of the real world,"" said Lenore Skenazy, the president of Let Grow, a nonprofit promoting childhood independence. ""A stationary bike doesn't prepare them for anything but moving their legs in a circular motion.""  Child development experts say that active play like tag or bicycling prepares them to succeed in life because they interact with people and build problem solving skills. Outdoor play helps kids create categories, like the different types of houses or dogs in their neighborhood. ""You can burn calories on this [stationary bike], but you can't get to know your neighbors,"" Skenazy said. But Bloomfield said that Little Tikes doesn't feel the Pelican should or will replace a regular bicycle. Little Tikes ""created a product that would make kids happy and stay active regardless of the state of the world,"" Bloomfield said. He added that their research found children wanted to emulate their parents on stationary bikes. ""We wanted to give the option for a safe and engaging experience alongside mom and dad's stationary bike,"" Bloomfield said. The Pelican incorporates fun exercise into kids' daily activities, he said, and is an alternative to flopping on the couch after school. Most kids don't get enough physical activity, he said.  But Jason Boye, a pediatric psychologist in the Healthy Weight and Wellness Clinic at Nemours Children's Hospital in Delaware, cautioned CNN Business that using exercise equipment can create negative associations with physical activity.  ""Kids can develop an association of being forced to do an activity and make it something they're not interested in doing,"" Boye said. He's concerned about the bike being used solely as a means of physical activity, but he said placing the bike alongside a parent's Peloton's to ride together would encourage quality time. Family bonding is one of the Pelican's benefits, Little Tikes' Bloomfield said. CJ Rich, a Florida father who owns a kids' stationary bike said he bought it for exactly that reason.  ""I thought it would be awesome for him to have something to copy me,"" Rich said of his son, who is now 6 and mostly rides a bike with training wheels outside. Rich thinks the stationary bike helped make his son more confident on his outdoor bike with training wheels. The stationary bike isn't used as much recently, in part because Rich sold his Peloton. (Peloton declined to comment for this story.) He was tired of Peloton's monthly fees and bought a mountain bike to ride outside instead. But he expects his younger son, age 2, will ride the stationary bike once he's big enough. ",2
93,"New York (CNN Business)Trendy soaps brand Lush Cosmetics is quitting Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat on Friday in a radical move to draw attention to how those platforms are damaging people's mental health.The company said Monday that its accounts will be deactivated on Nov. 26, the day after Thanksgiving, when most other brands and retailers kick their social media activity into high gear to win over holiday gift shoppers.Lush, which has more than 900 stores worldwide, including 240 across the United States and Canada, said it will remain off those social media channels globally until the platforms ensure a safer environment for their users. As much as Lush is known for its cruelty-free and organic bath bombs, shampoos and soaps, the brand also actively champions social and environmental causes such as Black Lives Matter, fights against deforestation and promotes sustainability to its 659,000 Instagram followers, 275,000 Twitter fans and more than 1 million Facebook followers.This isn't the first time Lush, a Millennials and Gen Z -favored brand, has tried quitting social media. The company made a similar attempt with its UK accounts in 2019 saying ""It was tired of fighting with algorithms"" and wanted to talk directly with its customers.The latest effort, however, is happening at a time when social media companies are under even more intense scrutiny over how their platforms may be contributing to mental and physical health issues, especially among younger individuals.Facebook is currently in the middle of possibly the biggest crisis in its 17-year history over issues about hate speech and misinformation, which have been amplified on the platform.""As an inventor of bath bombs, I pour all my efforts into creating products that help people switch off, relax and pay attention to their wellbeing,"" Jack Constantine, chief digital officer and product inventor at Lush, said in a release. ""Social media platforms have become the antithesis of this aim, with algorithms designed to keep people scrolling and stop them from switching off and relaxing.""The company said it hopes social media companies will ultimately enact stronger best practice guidelines. Lush said it will continue to be active on Twitter and YouTube. ",2
94,"New York (CNN Business)Astra, a startup building small rockets that launch out of rural Alaska, notched its first successful test flight on Friday night, putting a dummy satellite into orbit. The flight sent the company's stock price on a tear — soaring more than 30% at one point after trading hours opened Monday morning. Astra is one of dozens of companies that plan to use lightweight rockets to make frequent trips to space to drop off satellites. Astra, Rocket Lab and California-based Virgin Orbit are among the only startups that have now proven their rockets can get the job done.While SpaceX's Falcon rockets — which are used to haul large satellites, batches of satellites or NASA astronauts into orbit — stand at more than 200 feet tall, or roughly the height of four of Astra's rockets stacked on top of each other, Astra is looking to compete elsewhere. The idea behind companies such as Astra is to create smaller rockets that haul less mass into space, but can be built quickly and cheaply and launched agilely.Footage of Friday's launch, captured at the company's launch site in Kodiak, Alaska, shows the rocket roaring to life and making a clean swoop up into the night sky. It was the fourth attempt by the company to fire a rocket into orbit, and the success put Astra within the ranks of a small handful of private space exploration companies that have managed to safely put a rocket into orbit. When asked in a company Q&A posted online how Astra plans to stand out in such a crowded industry, Adam London, Astra's founder and chief technology officer, said that ""rockets are typically artisanal, crafted objects. You make one at a time, and they're very complicated. But when you really get into it, they don't need to be that complicated, particularly when you're not flying people or critical national assets, and they don't absolutely, positively have to work 100% of the time.""In other words, Astra plans to mass produce rockets to make them cheaper, but it doesn't put too much emphasis on having a pristine success rate.""I just want to say how incredibly appreciative I am of our shareholders, our customers, for their patience with us,"" CEO Chris Kemp told reporters Monday morning. ""And, of course, for the entire team here who's just worked so hard over the past couple of years, launch after launch, just continuing to put energy and passion into this.""The rocket company is one of numerous space companies that chose to make its stock market debut via SPAC — or special purpose acquisition company — in recent months. Many of those companies, including Astra (ASTR), took that leap despite not having proven their technological chops at the time of their stock market listing. But Friday's long-awaited successful test launch appeared to rally investors.Its market value shot up to more than $3 billion, a significant markup over the $2.1 billion valuation the company was given when it announced its SPAC plans in February. It also marked a recovery for the stock after it took a significant hit in the wake of Astra's last launch attempt in August. Rather than climbing skyward, the company's 43-foot-tall rocket hovered sideways off its launch pad before attempting to right itself, at which point it climbed about 30 miles into the air only to cut its engine power and plunge back into the ocean. Kemp told reporters that Friday's success was not without its challenges, not least of which was combating freezing temperatures in Kodiak.The satellite that launched Friday isn't designed to do anything useful, rather it was simply designed to simulate the weight of a real satellite. But Kemp said the company is now ready to focus on fine-tuning its rocket design, scaling up production and offering its services to paying customers. ",2
95,"New York (CNN Business)When Jeff Bezos decided to give up his role as Amazon's chief executive earlier this year, it prompted the company to name not one but two new CEOs. The first, Andy Jassy, replaced Bezos as CEO of Amazon's sprawling business. The second, Adam Selipsky, was hired in March to fill Jassy's old role as CEO of Amazon's single biggest moneymaker: Amazon Web Services (AWS).Selipsky was no stranger to AWS. He first joined the Amazon cloud computing division in 2005, before its services were even publicly available. But in 2016, after 11 years with the company, he left. In the five years he was away running data visualization firm Tableau, the business and the industry changed considerably, bringing Selipsky a new set of challenges.Annual revenue from AWS nearly quadrupled in that time, and the pandemic caused a huge surge in demand for cloud computing and cloud-based services. But the competitive landscape also intensified. While AWS pioneered cloud technology and is the longtime industry leader, rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOGL GOOGLE) Cloud have stolen some of its market share.  One of the first major hurdles for Selipsky is the battle, especially with Microsoft, for lucrative government cloud services contracts.  In 2019, Microsoft won a contract to modernize the Pentagon's IT infrastructure in a deal worth as much as $10 billion over 10 years, a major blow to AWS, which previously held a deal with the department. The contract was ultimately canceled after Amazon protested that former President Donald Trump had unfairly influenced the deal, but it signaled that AWS may no longer be the obvious choice for such major projects.Now, both companies are expected to bid — potentially along with others such as Google Cloud and Oracle — for the Defense Department's new Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract to replace the 2019 deal.   But in one of his first interviews since taking over as AWS CEO, Selipsky sounded confident about his company's prospects. The new AWS chief said he believes his company still has an edge over Microsoft in clinching government work. ""We really were the first in the cloud to have big, significant government contracts in every area of government and years before any of the competitors,"" he told CNN Business in an exclusive interview last week, which took place inside the new AWS Skills Center at the company's headquarters. ""We learned a lot about how to do cloud implementations and work very closely with federal government customers,"" he said.He added: ""I think you'll find, particularly given our leadership position, that our competitors spend a lot more time talking and worrying about AWS than we do about them — we choose to focus on our customers.""  (While such contracts are good for business, some employees have previously taken issue with the company's work for certain government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement — a dynamic that may only add to Selipsky's challenges in the role.)Selipsky said Amazon never anticipated being the only winner in the cloud. And the industry has certainly gotten large enough to accommodate more than one major player — public cloud spending is expected to reach more than $300 billion this year, according to Gartner estimates from April. ""In any fast growing, interesting market segment, there's going to be competition,"" he said. ""We've always thought there would be not a lot of winners, but a small handful of winners that emerge and have vigorous competition, and that's what we see. But we still are the significant leader.""We 'really encourage' employees speaking upShortly after Selipsky took charge of AWS, the business faced a different challenge from within. A group of employees circulated a petition alleging discrimination and harassment of women and minorities in one of the AWS business units, after which the company hired an outside firm to investigate. Similar employee activism has cropped up recently at Apple, Google and video game company Activision Blizzard.  While some companies have appeared to chafe at employee organizing (AWS parent company Amazon has faced criticism for what some see as anti-union efforts), Selipsky said he thinks workers speaking up may ultimately be good for the business.  ""I really like the fact that people are bringing their whole selves to work and that they're speaking out — we really encourage that,"" he said. ""I've found that if you have a really good process and really genuinely listen and show people that you're taking the time to listen, even when they disagree with you at the end of the day, we all can lock arms and move forward together.""He continued: ""I really welcome the fact that a lot of topics are being discussed today that maybe were discussed less in the workplace five, 10, 20 years ago."" Another growing concern with the cloud industry is that the data centers it relies on are energy intensive. Much of that computing is still reliant on fossil fuels, but Selipsky said AWS is working to change that in keeping with Amazon's larger promise to be net carbon zero across the company by 2040. Amazon's climate pledge was announced in 2019 just ahead of a planned walkout by employees over perceived inaction by the company on climate change.  ""Amazon intends to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025 ... and we're already about two-thirds of the way there, so we're making significant progress,"" he said. ""Just given our size and our scale and the things like the data centers we operate, we really have to drive them with renewable energy in order to hit that [2040] goal. We're doing a lot of innovating ourselves, we're doing a lot of partnering with a lot of companies, a lot of governments, a lot of nonprofits to reach those goals."" Selipsky will have his first chance to address customers at AWS's annual cloud conference, Re:Invent, in Las Vegas later this month. He said customers should expect announcements in some of ""our oldest and most basic services, things like compute and databases and storage,"" as well as ""exciting announcements about higher level services and industry specific solutions."" ""It's absolutely imperative that we continue to understand [customers'] evolving needs, which are changing very quickly, and we're going to evolve right along with them,"" he said.  ",2
96,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)For months, Elizabeth Holmes sat silently, masked, in a San Jose federal courtroom as the government mounted its case to jurors that she knowingly lied about the capabilities of her blood-testing company, Theranos, in order to get money. Now, Holmes wants jurors to hear her story in her own words: The famously charismatic former CEO took the witness stand Friday in her own criminal trial, taking off her mask to testify for roughly one hour before court recessed for the weekend and shortly after the prosecution rested its case after 11 weeks. She is expected to resume her testimony Monday, when court is in session from 9am PT to 1pm PT.  Court will also be in session Tuesday, before breaking for the holiday.For a time, Holmes was hailed as a visionary. A Stanford University dropout, she founded what would become Theranos in 2003 at age 19. The company claimed to have developed revolutionary blood testing technology that could accurately, reliably and efficiently conduct a range of tests using just a few drops of blood. Holmes raised $945 million from investors, struck key retail partnerships, and attracted a who's who list of board members and investors who'd bought into her claims. She was lauded on magazine covers as the richest self-made woman and ""the next Steve Jobs,"" an image she helped cultivate by dressing the part in her signature black turtleneck. At its peak, her startup was valued at $9 billion. Then, it all began to unravel when a Wall Street Journal reporter started poking holes in the company's claims. In her testimony, she said she believed Theranos had developed technology capable of running any blood test. She also testified that its proprietary blood analyzer machine was only ever used to perform 12 small sample tests, confirming what jurors heard during the government's case.First indicted more than three years ago, the start of Holmes' highly anticipated trial faced numerous delays due to the ongoing pandemic and the birth of her first child this summer. Holmes, now 37, is fighting nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The accusations are that she engaged in a scheme to defraud investors from 2010 to 2015, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients who paid for its blood testing services from 2013 to 2016.  She faces up to 20 years in prison, as well as a fine of $250,000, plus restitution, for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count. She has pleaded not guilty.A jury of eight men and four women will decide whether Holmes intended to deceive or, as the defense has argued, she was simply a young, ambitious yet inexperienced entrepreneur who acted in good faith and relied upon the wrong people. The government called 29 witnesses, including scientists, doctors, retail executives, former employees and even a former Defense Secretary, to make its case, which it rested Friday morning. The defense first called a paralegal for the law firm representing Holmes who introduced a number of documents into evidence, followed by a former Theranos board member who joined after the startup's downward spiral had begun. Then, at approximately 3pm PT, the defense called Holmes herself.""For the defense, this is an opportunity for the jury to meet the 'real' Elizabeth Holmes,"" said Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, who noted that the defense did not have to put on a case at all, and that the burden of proof is on the prosecution.""If Holmes paints herself as a 'big ideas' innovator who happened to be unaware of the company's failures or misstatements, she can help her case -- or at least sow doubt among several jurors,"" said Baer. ""And she can also help her case marginally if she appears more sympathetic or likeable than the person portrayed by the government's witnesses.""Her testimony so far has focused on the earliest days of the company, well before the time of the alleged fraud. Holmes, who was frequently smiling on the stand, testified about her original idea of developing a pill that could be swallowed and used for testing purposes and how that evolved into Theranos. She spoke to the caliber of individuals she attracted to help her build the company, beginning with her chemical engineering professor Channing Robertson, who would become its first board member. She testified about early fundraising efforts and being introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas, who would invest and become chairman of the board. She also spoke about signing contracts with two major pharmaceutical companies, and the first demonstration of its technology in Switzerland for Novartis in 2006.""We ran our technology in Switzerland at one of their offices and processed samples on cartridges that we brought there, and then had data wirelessly transmitted back to our site in California,"" Holmes said, testifying that the demonstration was successful.""We nailed this one,"" Holmes wrote in an email to her team.The testimony contradicts what reporter John Carreyrou -- the journalist who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Journal -- detailed in ""Bad Blood,"" his definitive book on the rise and fall of the company. ""One of the two readers Elizabeth took to Switzerland had malfunctioned when they got there. The employees she brought with her had stayed up all night trying to get it to work,"" the book reads, noting that ""to mask the problem"" a team in California ""beamed over a fake result.""Cross examination expected to be ""really, really rigorous""While the prosecution had indicated in court filings that Holmes was likely to take the stand in her own defense, legal experts such as Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg have said that determining whether or not to do so is ""a very complicated calculation."" That's because it means subjecting Holmes to a cross-examination that would undoubtedly be ""really, really rigorous."" As Weisberg noted to CNN Business, anything Holmes testifies about could potentially be impeached by what she's said and written over the years. The prosecution will get an opportunity to confront Holmes about many issues, but two stand out. One involves documents sent to stakeholders purporting to be validation of its technology from two major pharmaceutical companies; scientists from both companies testified the documents did not represent their conclusions and that the use of their companies' logos was not authorized. The other concerns claims from Holmes that its technology was deployed in the battlefield, which witnesses testified did not happen.Baer noted that, ""if she appears to evade questions, she may inadvertently strengthen the government's narrative.""So far during Holmes' testimony, there's been no mention of Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. Holmes' attorneys indicated in pre-trial court filings that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani, who was also her boyfriend at the time of the alleged fraud. Balwani, who will face the same charges as Holmes when his trial gets underway next year and has also pleaded not guilty, ""adamantly denies"" the allegations, according to a court filing.Nearly 20 years Holmes' senior, the pair met in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford's Mandarin program.When will jurors deliberate?Before Holmes was called to the witness stand Friday afternoon, Judge Edward Davila informed jurors the case would not be done by December 6, a date he said he'd previously given them. An updated calendar on the court's website now has the trial scheduled through December 17. This comes as the judge has added numerous court days in November, as well as stretched the hours for sessions.Outside the presence of jurors, Davila addressed attorneys about the trial's pacing: ""I don't think any of you -- I hope none of you are being strategic as far as timing. And I say that because my sense is that none of you want this jury to be deliberating this case on the holiday week in December, the third week of December or any week like that."" He continued: ""We're concerned about the jury and their comfort level and keeping them engaged,"" adding that having a jury deliberate over a holiday week ""doesn't benefit either side."" The prosecution has expressed frustration with the amount of time the defense has taken up during its case, saying that it exceeded the number of hours the government has spent questioning its own witnesses. Eying the calendar could indeed be a strategic move for the defense, according to George Demos, a former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and an adjunct law professor at the UC Davis School of Law. ""The defense may aim to have the case submitted to the jury right before Christmas because that's not the time of year a lot of people would feel comfortable sending a new mother to jail,"" he told CNN Business.

97," (CNN Business)The pandemic has boosted the digital economy across the world, and Africa is no exception. However, limited internet access remains a major stumbling block in Africa's digital transformation, as do inconsistent policies across the continent in areas such as payment systems and data roaming.Looking to remedy that is Smart Africa, a partnership between 32 African countries, and groups including the World Bank and the African Union. Tasked with developing the continent's digital infrastructure, the organization recently signed an agreement with Intel (INTC) to develop its member states' digital skills and understanding of emerging technologies, such as cloud computing. Eleni Giokos spoke with Lacina Koné, director general of the Smart Africa secretariat, about the continent's digital future. The following interview has been edited for clarity and length.I want to talk about Smart Africa's ambition to create a digitally connected Africa by 2030. How are you planning to achieve this goal?Koné: We can achieve this by organizing ourselves. Every country who joins has a flagship project — Rwanda's is a smart city, South Africa's is artificial intelligence and blockchain, Burkina Faso's is capacity building, Côte d'Ivoire is cybersecurity. We assist them, take it from a concept to a blueprint for pilot, then scale it up. When we get to the scaling-up stage, we share the best practice with the rest of the members. We're learning from each other and growing together. And the central role that Smart Africa is playing is really coordination and our organization of laws, because what is very important is building a regulatory environment in Africa for emerging technology for investors to back.Read: Now for the hard part, says Secretary General of African Continental Free Trade AreaWe've seen incredible movements in the financial technology space — Africa dominates the use of mobile money transfers — but have we seen anything new that's disruptive, that's transforming lives dramatically?Koné: We have seen it, but probably not big enough. Today, Africa has about seven tech unicorns [privately owned startups valued at over $1 billion]. When we talk about leapfrogging, this is about innovation-based entrepreneurship. We need a digital economy that is sustainable and that requires an adaptive regulatory environment. I keep on saying infrastructure is a regulatory environment. Digital governance is a regulatory matter.I want to talk about some of the most amazing tech startups that have been bought out by Silicon Valley, like Stripe's takeover of Nigeria's Paystack for over $200 million. Do we want that to happen? Or do we want to keep them purely African? Koné: Even if those companies are bought by Silicon Valley companies, they still remain African companies doing great in the US and wider world. I think this is actually a very good way of looking at things. Imagine our young generation, the young programmers and coders, seeing their friends developing companies being bought for a billion dollars. It actually encourages them and one way the government is helping them to actually organize themselves is through what we call Startup Acts: supportive legislation designed to stimulate entrepreneurship. That's an opportunity for them to set up a company and sell it.Fast cheap internet is still not a reality for many people. How do we bridge the gap?Koné: True — today the connectivity is at 39.8%. Mobile network operators are there, but people are not using it because of affordability, cybersecurity, access to devices and content. So once we're able to work on those, I think from now to 2025 we can see this jumping from 39% to 51%. So we are very optimistic. I believe we are doing really great at our own pace.So let's say you've achieved your goal of creating a single continent-wide digital market — describe what that would look like. Koné: To think about where we are right now, just think about Dubai 20 years ago. That's what Africa can be by 2030. That's only nine years from now. It means you can do literally everything from your couch, not even moving, paying everything by mobile money for public or private services. The infrastructure will be abundant, so it's quite possible. I think I can say it is the digital ""Wakanda"" [a fictional African country that's home to Marvel superhero Black Panther] — actually better. And of course close to 60% of Africa's population is living in rural areas. This is something also being taken into consideration. That's why Smart Africa has a broadband strategy 2025 to connect those rural areas.",2

99,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)China is bringing the regulatory hammer down yet again on some of the country's largest tech firms. Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and other companies were all slapped with fines over the weekend for violating antitrust laws, the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) said in a statement.SAMR listed 43 separate violations, with some offenses dating back as far as 2012. The penalty for each fine is 500,000 yuan ($78,000).""The cases announced this time are all transactions that should have been declared but not declared in the past,"" SAMR said in its statement. The market regulator has spearheaded a yearlong campaign against Big Tech in China. The totals announced Saturday are small in comparison to some of the marquee penalties levied earlier this year, including an 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) record fine that Alibaba (BABA) was ordered to pay.  At the time, antitrust regulators said they had concluded that the online shopping giant had been behaving like a monopoly.Shares of Alibaba, Tencent (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU) were all slightly lower in Hong Kong on Monday following the announcement. Baidu fell the most, 2.1%, while Tencent slumped 0.3%.Alibaba fell 1.6%. The company on Friday plunged nearly 11% in its steepest decline since listing in Hong Kong in November 2019.

100,"El Salvador plans to build the world's first ""Bitcoin City"", funded initially by bitcoin-backed bonds, President Nayib Bukele said on Saturday, doubling down on his bet to harness the crypto currency to fuel investment in the Central American country.Speaking at an event closing a week-long promotion of bitcoin in El Salvador, Bukele said the city planned in the eastern region of La Union would get geothermal power from a volcano and not levy any taxes except for a value added tax (VAT).""Invest here and make all the money you want,"" Bukele said in English, dressed all in white and wearing a reversed baseball cap, in the beach resort of Mizata. ""This is a fully ecological city that works and is energized by a volcano.""Half of the VAT levied would be used to fund the bonds issued to build the city, and the other half would pay for services such as garbage collection, Bukele said, estimating the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 bitcoins.El Salvador in September became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.Although Bukele is a popular president, opinion polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about his love of bitcoin, and its bumpy introduction has fueled protests against the government.Likening his plan to cities founded by Alexander the Great, Bukele said Bitcoin City would be circular, with an airport, residential and commercial areas, and feature a central plaza designed to look like a bitcoin symbol from the air.""If you want bitcoin to spread over the world, we should build some Alexandrias,"" said Bukele, a tech savvy 40-year-old who in September proclaimed himself ""dictator"" of El Salvador on Twitter in an apparent joke.El Salvador plans to issue the initial bonds in 2022, Bukele said, suggesting it would be in 60 days time.Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain technology provider Blockstream, told the gathering the first 10-year issue, known as the ""volcano bond"", would be worth $1 billion, backed by bitcoin and carrying a coupon of 6.5%. Half of the sum would go to buying bitcoin on the market, he said. Other bonds would follow.After a five year lock-up, El Salvador would start selling some of the bitcoin used to fund the bond to give investors an ""additional coupon"", Mow said, positing that the value of the cryptocurrency would continue to rise robustly.""This is going to make El Salvador the financial center of the world,"" he said.The bond would be issued on the ""liquid network"", a bitcoin sidechain network. To facilitate the process, El Salvador's government is working on a securities law, and the first license to operate an exchange would go to Bitfinex, Mow said.Crypto exchange Bitfinex was listed as the book runner for the bond on a presentation behind Mow.Once 10 such bonds were issued, $5 billion in bitcoin would be taken off the market for several years, Mow said. ""And if you get 10 more countries to do these bonds, that's half of bitcoin's market cap right there.""The ""game theory"" on the bonds gave first issuer El Salvador an advantage, Mow argued, saying: ""If bitcoin at the five-year mark reaches $1 million, which I think it will, they will sell bitcoin in two quarters and recoup that $500 million.""

101,"New York (CNN Business)Apple posted a statement to its employees Friday evening reminding them of their rights to speak up about their pay and working conditions. The move comes after months of employee organizing in a movement that's come to be known as #AppleToo.  ""Apple is deeply committed to providing employees with a workplace where they feel safe, respected, and inspired to do their best work,"" the company said in the statement posted to an internal employee portal, which was obtained by CNN Business. ""Our policies do not restrict employees from speaking freely about their wages, hours, or working conditions."" The statement added that employees are welcome to raise concerns ""in the way they feel most comfortable, internally or externally."" NBC first reported the memo Friday. In recent months, Apple (AAPL) employees have broken with the company's historic culture of secrecy to speak out on controversial hiring decisions, alleged pay disparities and remote work policies.  Apple did not respond to requests for comment for this article.  Two Apple employees, Janneke Parrish and Cher Scarlett, started #AppleToo in August to help the company's workers ""organize and protect ourselves,"" according to the movement's website. They called on coworkers to share stories of issues they may have faced, including incidents of racism, sexism and discrimination, in order to outline ""changes we expect to see Apple make."" Parrish told CNN Business last month that they received hundreds of reports from employees within weeks about alleged incidents that ""range the gamut from sexism and ageism to disclosures of rape and suicide,"" she said. Parrish filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board earlier this month alleging that she was fired from her job as an Apple program manager in October in retaliation for her organizing efforts. (At the time, Apple said it does not discuss specific employee matters but that ""we take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised."" For her part, Scarlett said on Twitter last week that Friday was her last day at Apple. Friday's statement by Apple is a win for the #AppleToo movement, Parrish told CNN Business.  ""It's something that we've wanted Apple to communicate for the entirety of #AppleToo,"" Parrish said. ""It's definitely not the end of the road but it's a really big first step and it shows what workers speaking in unison can achieve."" She added that one common theme in the stories that employees have submitted to #AppleToo is that workers don't know that they're allowed to speak up when issues arise. The company's recent statement will ""help end a systemic culture of silence around our working culture and pay equity,"" she said.  ",2
102," (CNN Business)Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder and former CEO of Theranos, is taking the stand in her own criminal trial.Holmes began testimony on Friday afternoon in the San Jose courtroom during the first day of the defense's case. She is also expected to testify on Monday and Tuesday next week, the only days court is in session.Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces 11 federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each charge.Whether Holmes would testify was a big question looming over the trial. She has attended the trial each day, typically with her mother and occasionally her partner. On Friday, her partner, mother and at least one person who appeared to be her friend were in attendance. She was smiling as she took the stand and during much of her testimony.Off the bat, Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey asked her if she believed Theranos had developed technology that was capable of running any blood test. ""I did,"" Holmes testified. ""We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all the technologies in a laboratory. The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples and run that formula,"" Holmes testified, adding that by 2009 or 2010, the company had a ""breakthrough."" Downey then stepped backed to establish the background of the company's origin, including how she was a chemical engineering student at Stanford University and her first patent application.""I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money that they had saved for me to be able to go to college to work on my patent,"" she testified. ""Then I went to try to raise or borrow money.""""Were you able to?"" her attorney asked.""I was,"" she replied.The original patent was not for blood testing. Rather, she started with the idea of a pill that could be swallowed without any other actions needed, she said.Holmes went on to explain the evolution of her idea from a pill to a patch to a benchtop device. ""As I started talking to people about what could be useful for a pharmaceutical clinical trial, I learned people were interested in a benchtop or a tabletop device and we moved to trying to build that,"" she said.She testified that she then built out a prototype and set out to raise financing to develop it into a product. She testified she was introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas ""by someone who had gone to college with my dad."" ""I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long-term,"" she testified, adding that he did a ""very comprehensive diligence process.""Holmes said that process included ""giving him a lot of information about our patents."" ""He asked us to get an audit of our financials,"" she testified. ""He wanted copies of contracts and other information about the business. He wanted to speak to people that we were talking to and interacting with.""He ultimately invested and served as Theranos' chairman of the board for a number of years.Holmes' attorneys previously indicated in court documents that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. They indicated that she is ""likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed, relied on, and deferred to Mr. Balwani,"" who is nearly 20 years her senior. The filings were from 2020 and unsealed just before the trial kicked off with jury selection in late August. Balwani, according to a court filing from his attorneys, ""adamantly denies"" the claims.Her attorneys also indicated plans to have an expert testify about the psychological, emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of Balwani.A Stanford University dropout, Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 with the mission to revolutionize blood testing. Inspired by her stated fear of needles, the company promised patients the ability to test for conditions such as cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos had struck up partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway, and a who's who list of board members and investors. Then it all came crashing down. A damning investigation by The Wall Street Journal in October 2015 called into question the capabilities of the company's proprietary blood testing machine, Edison, as well as Theranos' testing methods. Theranos was subsequently sued by investors for fraud and had its US blood-testing license revoked. The firm settled ""massive fraud"" charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately dissolved in September 2018.",2
103,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)After testimony from 29 witnesses, federal prosecutors are resting their case against Elizabeth Holmes, the former CEO and founder of failed blood testing startup Theranos.  Over the course of 31 court days spread out over nearly three months, jurors heard from a broad assortment of witnesses in the San Jose federal courtroom where the highly-anticipated trial of Holmes kicked off with opening statements on September 8. The start of the trial faced numerous delays due to the ongoing pandemic and the birth of Holmes' first child this summer.To make its case, the prosecution turned to scientists, doctors, retail executives, former employees and even a former Defense Secretary. Through them, the government attempted to unravel the many layers of the alleged deception that led investors and patients to believe Theranos' false promises that it could accurately, reliably and efficiently conduct a range of tests using just a few drops of blood.Holmes, a Stanford University dropout who founded Theranos in 2003 at age 19 with the lofty mission of revolutionizing blood testing, is facing nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The government alleges she knowingly misled doctors, patients, and investors about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Now 37, Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison, as well as a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count. She has pleaded not guilty. Jurors heard from investors who lost millions of dollars after having been provided information by Holmes about Theranos' supposed blood testing capabilities. That information included, jurors learned, falsified documents purporting to be endorsements of its technology from two major pharmaceutical companies. Jurors heard from three patients; one was falsely told she was miscarrying after taking a Theranos test when, in fact, her pregnancy was viable; another was told she had HIV antibodies when previous and subsequent tests by other labs indicated she did not. The trial now turns to the defense, which has given some indications of what its case could entail during opening arguments and cross examinations of government witnesses. Holmes' team has sought to convince jurors that Holmes -- who it frequently characterizes as a young, ambitious but inexperienced entrepreneur -- acted in good faith, and lacked the intent to deceive. Instead, it has pointed at others for Theranos' downfall.Holmes' attorneys have blamed the lab's failings on lab directors and Theranos' COO and president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, with whom Holmes was romantically involved and who was roughly two decades her senior. (Balwani is set to face federal prosecutors over the same charges next year; he has pleaded not guilty.)  ""There were lots of misleading statements made during the lifespan of Theranos. The jury has now heard that evidence. But the government still has to establish intent -- and that provides a real opportunity for the defense,"" Mark MacDougall, a white-collar defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor, told CNN Business.  Many layers to the government's caseProsecutors sought to contrast the issues inside Theranos with how it was pitching itself to investors and business partners. The prosecutors also attempted to show that Holmes was at the center of it all, in an effort to address the trial's three main questions: what Holmes knew, when she knew it, and whether she intended to deceive investors, patients and doctors.Multiple high-profile witnesses testified about Holmes' charisma and, according to the former CEO of Safeway, her unusually hands-on role ""negotiating completely on her own."" Investors and retail executives testified that they were kept in the dark about the company's true capabilities. And former employees testified that they alerted Holmes directly to the lab's issues, to little effect.Surekha Gangakhedkar, a scientist who worked at Theranos for eight years, testified that she quit in 2013 over her concerns with launching blood tests to consumers through its Walgreens partnership. When she expressed this to Holmes, she testified the CEO responded by conveying ""that when she has a promise to deliver to the customer, she doesn't have much of a choice but to go ahead with the launch.""Similarly, Adam Rosendorff, the former lab director who was questioned for six days of the trial, testified that while he technically reported to Balwani, Holmes sat above Balwani. Rosendorff said he made his own concerns known to Holmes and ultimately determined ""the company believed more about PR and fundraising than about patient care."" After Rosendorff departed, Theranos had two co-lab directors who overlapped yet were unaware of each others' existence. One rarely ever set foot in the lab and only met Holmes once; the other never visited the lab. Investors and business partners had little visibility into these issues at the time. Former executives for Walgreens and Safeway, testified that they were kept in the dark that the company relied on third-party devices, rather than its own, to analyze patient blood. Witnesses like former Walgreens executive Wade Miquelon testified being shown pharmaceutical company endorsements which had been faked.Miquelon and some investors also said they were impressed by another misleading claim: that Theranos' technology was being tested in Afghanistan on military helicopters. ""What better application for a technology like this than in a military setting under harsh conditions like one would expect in a place like Afghanistan or Iraq,"" investor Brian Grossman, whose firm Partner Fund Management poured $96 million into Theranos, testified this week.Theranos' association with retired four-star general and former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who once served on Theranos' board, made it plausible that the startup could have had its technology deployed to help solders in war zones and on military aircrafts. But Mattis, arguably the biggest name to take the stand, testified it was not, as did a former Theranos employee who was involved with its conversations with the military.These misrepresentations were fed directly from Holmes to journalist Roger Parloff, who was the government's final witness before it rested its case. Parloff wrote the 2014 Fortune Magazine cover story, which was one of the glowing articles that circulted Theranos' claims and factored into why investors were wowed.Six investors, whose investments are each part of the wire fraud charges Holmes is facing, took the stand, including some who spoke about investments made by some of the world's wealthiest families.Among them were a money manager for the billionaire family of former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and a former lawyer who first heard about Theranos from a longtime client — former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger — and then solicited other rich families to invest, including the DeVos family, the Waltons of the Walmart fortune, and the heir to an Italian auto empire. From the outset of the trial, legal experts have suggested jurors may be less sympathetic to investors than patients, who are the other category of alleged victims in the government's case.The government introduced two patients, and a doctor in the final week of its case. Earlier this month, the prosecution botched an attempt to bring in another patient because it failed to list the specific test the patient took on a document previously provided to the defense. That error resulted in the government removing one count of wire fraud.The prosecution had listed roughly 180 possible witnesses it may call. Among those it didn't call: Kissinger, who once sat on the board; media mogul Rupert Murdoch who reportedly invested $125 million; high-powered attorney David Boies who was an investor, board member and legal defense for Holmes and Theranos, and employee-turned-whistleblower Tyler Shultz, the grandson of the late George Shultz, another former Secretary of State and board member. Jurors heard her voice, read her texts and saw clips of her TV interviewsIn the company's heyday, Holmes was the subject of much media attention as it soared to its once-$9 billion valuation. In its downfall, that spotlight hasn't dimmed -- there have been documentaries, a forthcoming limited series, a planned feature film and at least two podcasts devoted to covering the trial. That attention was a big challenge to selecting a pool of jurors largely unfamiliar with her.But since the beginning of the trial, jurors -- who knew little, if anything about the baritone-voiced entrepreneur with a penchant for black turtlenecks -- have only gotten glimpses into how she spoke, and presented herself.They heard audio from a 2013 investor call where Holmes made claims about Theranos' testing capabilities and its work with the military. They also saw television clips from interviews she gave after the 2015 Wall Street Journal investigation that first poked holes in its technology and testing methods. ""I'm the founder and CEO of the company — anything that happens in this company is my responsibility,"" she said, in a April 2016 Today Show clip.Perhaps the most intimate look jurors have gotten into Holmes' state of mind at the time of the alleged fraud has come through text messages between her and Balwani. The texts, some of which have been introduced through various witnesses, ranged from personal to professional and reveal the two were in constant communication. Among them, they discussed the state of Theranos' clinical lab in November, 2014 as the company was securing investments (""Normandy lab is a f***ing disaster zone,"" Balwani wrote) and how they felt when regulators were doing a laboratory audit in September, 2015 (""Praying literally non stop,"" Holmes wrote. ""Going bad so far. Pray,"" Balwani wrote). There were also more intimate ""love you"" texts to some confusing ones that mentioned ""the death and sex thing,"" which went unexplained to jurors. ""There's an aspect of many criminal cases where the jury is asked to get inside the heads of the defendant and other important individuals in the case and that can be uncomfortable for a variety of reasons,"" said Jessica Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Cardozo Law School professor. Roth noted that, given the particulars of the Holmes case, ""it is warranted, at least to a certain extent, to get inside that relationship and to understand the nature of the power dynamics.""Will Holmes take the stand? Whether jurors will get to hear from Holmes, who is listed as a possible witness, remains an open question. Legal experts such as Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg say that determining whether to take the stand is ""a very complicated calculation."" Doing so would mean subjecting Holmes to a cross-examination that would undoubtedly be ""really, really rigorous."" He noted that anything she testifies about could potentially be impeached by things she has said and written over the years. Another looming question: whether Holmes will claim she was the victim of intimate partner abuse at the hands of Balwani. The allegation, which Balwani's attorneys have denied, was introduced in pre-trial filings. So far, her attorneys have only vaguely hinted at the idea in opening arguments. Still, among the possible witnesses for Holmes is clinical psychologist, Dr. Mindy Mechanic, whose work focuses on the psychosocial consequences of violence, trauma and victimization.The defense is likely to continue playing up Holmes' youthful age and lack of experience at the time of the alleged fraud. Through cross examinations, the defense has drilled into the expertise of witnesses and their teams in contrast to Holmes. Holmes, her attorneys have argued, wasn't qualified to run a laboratory. The defense also sought to sow doubt in the due diligence process of investors and underscore that startups are known to be risky investments. ""Elizabeth was only in her twenties, had no prior business experience and was surrounded by much older mentors and advisers,"" said MacDougall, the white-collar defense lawyer. ""The defense now has the chance to put the evidence in context.""George Demos, a former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and an adjunct law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, said the defense ""may call witnesses to testify about Theranos' successes to show that Holmes was in fact on the road to achieving her goals.""Holmes, who has been present each day inside the courtroom, is dutifully accompanied by her mother, Noel, who oftentimes walks hand-in-hand with her daughter to the door through which she enters the courtroom and gives her a hug. (Holmes' father is listed as a possible defense witness.)Anne Kopf-Sill, Phd., a retired biotechnology executive who has been attending the trial most days and has been following the story of Theranos for years, said she's been struck by the persona Holmes gives off in the courtroom: ""She's just sitting there looking sweeter than an angel.""

104," (CNN Business)Every time you pick up your smartphone, you're summoning algorithms. They're used for everything from unlocking your phone with your face to deciding what videos you see on TikTok to updating your Google Maps route to avoid a freeway accident on your way to work.An algorithm is a set of rules or steps followed, often by a computer, to produce an outcome.  And algorithms aren't just on our phones: they're used in all kinds of processes, on and offline, from helping value your home to teaching your robot vacuum to steer clear of your dog's poop. Over the years they've increasingly been entrusted with life-altering decisions, such as helping decide who to arrest, who should be released from jail before a court date, and who's approved for a home loan.In recent weeks, there has been renewed scrutiny of algorithms, including how tech companies should shift the ways they use them. This stems both from concerns raised in hearings featuring Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen and from bipartisan legislation introduced in the House (a companion bill had previously been reintroduced in the Senate). The legislation would force large tech companies to allow users to access a version of their platforms where what they see isn't shaped by algorithms. These developments highlight mounting awareness about the central role algorithms play in our society.""At this point, they are responsible for making decisions about pretty much every aspect of our lives,"" said Chris Gilliard, a visiting research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.Yet the ways in which algorithms work, and the conclusions they reach, can be mysterious, particularly as the use of artificial intelligence techniques make them ever more complex. Their outcomes aren't always understood, or accurate — and the consequences can be disastrous. And the impact of potential new legislation to limit the influence of algorithms on our lives remains unclear.Algorithms, explainedAt its most basic, an algorithm is a series of instructions. As Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist on the ethical AI team at AI model builder Hugging Face, pointed out, it can be hard coded, with fixed directions for a computer to follow, such as to put a list of names in alphabetical order. Simple algorithms have been used for computer-based decision making for decades.Today, algorithms help ease otherwise-complicated processes all the time, whether we know it or not. When you direct a clothing website to filter pajamas to see the most popular or least expensive options, you're using an algorithm essentially to say, ""Hey, Old Navy, go through the steps to show me the cheapest jammies.""All kinds of things can be algorithms, and they're not confined to computers: A recipe, for instance, is a sort of algorithm, as is the weekday morning routine you sleepily shuffle through before leaving the house.""We run on our own personal algorithms every day,"" said Jevan Hutson, a data privacy and security lawyer at Seattle-based Hintze Law who has studied AI and surveillance.But while we can interrogate our own decisions, those made by machines have become increasingly enigmatic. That's because of the rise of a form of AI known as deep learning, which is modeled after the way neurons work in the brain and gained prominence about a decade ago.A deep-learning algorithm might task a computer with looking at thousands of videos of cats, for instance, to learn to identify what a cat looks like. (It was a big deal when Google figured out how to do this reliably in 2012.) The result of this process of binging on data and improving over time would be, in essence, a computer-generated procedure for how the computer will identify whether there's a cat in any new pictures it sees. This is often known as a model (though it is also at times referred to as an algorithm itself).These models can be incredibly complex. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter use them to help personalize users' feeds based on each person's interests and prior activity. The models can also be based on mounds of data collected over many years that no human could possibly sort through. Zillow, for instance, has been using its trademarked, machine-learning assisted ""Zestimate"" to estimate the value of homes since 2006, taking into consideration tax and property records, homeowner-submitted details such as the addition of a bathroom, and pictures a house.The risks of relying on algorithmsAs Zillow's case shows, however, offloading decision-making to algorithmic systems can also go awry in excruciating ways, and it's not always clear why.Zillow recently decided to shutter its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, showing how hard it is to use AI to value real estate. In February, the company had said its ""Zestimate"" would represent an initial cash offer from the company to purchase the property through its house flipping business; in November, the company took a $304 million inventory writedown, which it blamed on having recently purchased homes for prices that are higher than it thinks it can sell them.Elsewhere online, Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has come under scrutiny for tweaking its algorithms in a way that helped incentivize more negative content on the world's largest social network.There have been life-changing consequences of algorithms, too, particularly in the hands of police. We know, for instance, that several Black men, at least, have been wrongfully arrested due to the use of facial-recognition systems.There's often little more than a basic explanation from tech companies on how their algorithmic systems work and what they're used for. Beyond that, experts in technology and tech law told CNN Business that even those who build these systems don't always know why they reach their conclusions — which is a reason why they're often referred to as ""black boxes.""""Computer scientists, data scientists, at this current stage they seem like wizards to a lot of people because we don't understand what it is they do,"" Gilliard said. ""And we think they always do, and that's not always the case.""Popping filter bubblesThe United States doesn't have federal rules for how companies can or can't use algorithms in general, or those that harness AI in particular. (Some states and cities have passed their own rules, which tend to address facial-recognition software or biometrics more generally.) But Congress is currently considering legislation dubbed the Filter Bubble Transparency Act, which, if passed, would force large Internet companies such as Google, Meta, TikTok and others to ""give users the option to engage with a platform without being manipulated by algorithms driven by user-specific data"".In a recent CNN Opinion piece, Republican Sen. John Thune described the legislation he cosponsored as ""a bill that would essentially create a light switch for big tech's secret algorithms — artificial intelligence (AI) that's designed to shape and manipulate users' experiences — and give consumers the choice to flip it on or off."" Facebook, for example, does already have this, though users are effectively discouraged from flipping the so-called switch permanently. A fairly well-hidden ""Most Recent"" button will show you posts in a reverse chronological order, but your Facebook News Feed will go back to its original, heavily moderated state once you leave the website or shut the app. Meta stopped offering such an option on Instagram, which it also owns, in 2016.Hutson noted that while the Filter Bubble Transparency Act clearly focuses on large social platforms, it will inevitably affect others such as Spotify and Netflix that depend deeply on algorithmically-driven curation. If it passes, he said, it will ""fundamentally change"" the business model of companies that are built entirely around algorithmic curation — a feature he suspects many users appreciate in certain contexts.""This is going to impact organizations far beyond those that are in the spotlight,"" he said. AI experts argue the need for more transparency is crucial from companies making and using algorithms. Luccioni believes laws for algorithmic transparency are necessary before specific usages and applications of AI can be regulated.""I see things changing, definitely, but there is a really frustrating lag between what AI is capable of and what it's legislated for,"" Luccioni said.",2
105,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)Journalist Roger Parloff, who wrote the first major cover story on Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes and later issued a retraction, was called to testify in her criminal trial Thursday.The government has alleged Holmes used the media, and Parloff's Fortune Magazine story titled ""This CEO is Out for Blood"" in particular, to perpetuate a scheme to defraud investors.Parloff's testimony comes as the government has said it is close to resting its case against Holmes. She faces a dozen counts of federal fraud and conspiracy charges, and up to 20 years in prison over allegations that she knowingly misled doctors, patients and investors in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty.Parloff is set to return to the stand Friday for continued cross-examination. Thus far the defense has focused on Parloff's note taking and reporting process.Holmes was for a time upheld in the media as a rare female founder who'd raised significant sums of capital and driven her startup to an eye-popping $9 billion valuation. Parloff's story was the first of many laudatory cover stories of Holmes and has been shown repeatedly in the San Jose courtroom. Through Parloff's testimony, the government pieced together various layers of the alleged fraud that it has spent more than 10 weeks establishing before jurors through witness testimonies. Parloff testified he has interview notes, as well as 10 hours of audio recordings from interviews associated with his 2014 Fortune story, clips of which have been played for the jury. The recordings contrast how Holmes represented the company's capabilities with what jurors have heard from other witness testimonies. In one recording, Holmes explains that the company can do tests for 1,000 ""CPT"" or medical codes, despite its website stating 200 tests. Jurors have previously heard Theranos could only perform around a dozen tests using its proprietary technology, one of the numerous points prosecutor John Bostic sought to highlight through questioning Parloff about what Holmes told him in his interviews.Parloff said Holmes did not tell him about Theranos' reliance on third-party devices. When Parloff asked Holmes about use of venous draws instead of its finger stick method, Holmes is heard ticking off a list of reasons why it may conduct such a sample, but does not disclose, as Bostic elicited, it is because of the limitations of Theranos' devices.Parloff testified that Holmes told him that its tech had been used in Afghanistan, but that ""she did not want me to publish that."" While Parloff interviewed James Mattis, the former US Secretary of Defense and onetime Theranos board member, he testified Holmes told him the retired four-star general couldn't discuss deployment and not to ask him about it.During his reporting, Holmes sent Parloff the reports, affixed with Pfizer and Schering-Plough logos, purporting to validate its blood tests, which jurors have learned were not legitimate. Parloff testified that after the article's publication, Holmes ""praised it effusively,"" and said he believed she linked to it on Theranos' website. The article, which contained false and misleading statements, circulated to stakeholders and how it played a role in validating the company to outsiders.""This morning I had one of the most interesting meetings I can recall with the women [sic] profiled in the attached Fortune magazine article,"" read one email shown to jurors from the CEO of RDV Corp, the family office of the billionaire family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The email was sent to members of the DeVos family before they invested $100 million into Theranos.Investor Chris Lucas, whose firm Black Diamond Ventures invested more than $7 million across two funding rounds in 2006 and 2013, testified earlier this month that the piece made him ""proud of the situation. Proud that we are involved. Proud of Elizabeth."" ""Great article, great pictures, the whole thing,"" testified Lucas.In a column more than a year later titled ""How Theranos Misled Me,"" Parloff acknowledged that the article ""helped raise to prominence"" Holmes. (There is now an author's note at the top of his original article that links to the column and reads, ""On December 17, 2015, I published a protracted correction to this article here."")""As much as I'd like to say that Holmes lied to me, I don't think she did. I do believe I was misled — intentionally — but I was also culpable, in that I failed to probe certain exasperatingly opaque answers that I repeatedly received,"" wrote Parloff, who was formerly an attorney.The government said in a court filing that it will not seek to admit the follow-up column but ""reserves the right to introduce that article for a non-hearsay purpose should the defense open the door by questioning Parloff about statements he made in that article.""For weeks, attorneys have been wrangling over what Parloff can testify to, and what information he can be compelled to provide. While Parloff has turned over audio recordings and notes from his interviews with Holmes and former Theranos COO Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani as part of a grand jury subpoena order, he successfully fought a trial subpoena order by Holmes' defense team for notes and recordings from interviews he conducted with others for his story. (Balwani faces the same charges as Holmes; his criminal trial is slated to begin next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.)Holmes' attorneys argued those notes may serve to refute the claims that Holmes misled Parloff, and through him, investors. Judge Nathanael Cousins, who presided in a hearing on the matter, called the quest for Parloff's additional notes ""a fishing expedition as to whether there might be material out there that could be helpful to the defense.""Parloff's remorse over the story has been well-documented. ""Roger was first [to the story] and felt a tremendous amount of guilt,"" said Alex Gibney in 2019. Gibney is the prolific documentary filmmaker whose HBO film, ""The Inventor,"" chronicled the rise and fall of Theranos. Gibney, who has said his work started with interviewing journalists who felt duped, has called Parloff the ""beating heart"" of his film. (CNN and HBO share a parent company.)In addition to Parloff's article, a 2013 piece by a Wall Street Journal opinion writer, who has since passed away, has been frequently brought up in the courtroom. The government has alleged that, prior to its publication, Holmes approved the piece, which offered a glowing look at Holmes and Theranos, but also contained misleading claims about the company's capabilities at the time. The article corresponded with a broader unveiling of the startup after years of operating in stealth and was leveraged by Holmes as validation of the company.In a statement to CNN Business in September, Journal spokesperson Steve Severinghaus said, ""editors make publishing decisions based on their independent judgment.""The statement continued, ""Our writer asked Elizabeth Holmes to confirm complicated facts on a technical subject, not to approve publication. Our writer visited Theranos, spoke with numerous sources in and outside the company about its technology, and had his blood tested on a Theranos machine that appeared to offer credible results. If that was all a deception, then the responsibility lies with Ms. Holmes and Theranos.""",2
106,"New York (CNN Business)A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general have launched an investigation into Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on children and teens.  The announcement follows extensive reporting on a trove of internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Some of those documents show that the company's own researchers have found that Instagram can damage young users' mental health and body image, and can exacerbate dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders.  The attorneys general say they will look into whether, by continuing to provide and promote Instagram despite knowing of the potential harms, Meta violated consumer protection laws and ""put the public at risk."" The states involved include California, Florida, Kentucky and Vermont. ""Facebook, now Meta, has failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health -- exploiting children in the interest of profit,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigation, said in a statement. She added that the coalition hopes to ""get to the bottom of this company's engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good."" Meta (FB) spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement that the allegations made by the attorneys general are false and said they ""demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts."" He also noted that the company plans to launch features to help teens regulate their use of Instagram, such as a ""Take a Break"" reminder, which was announced in October amid intense scrutiny.  ""While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,"" the statement reads. ""We continue to develop parental supervision controls and are exploring ways to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for teens by default."" The investigation is the latest escalation of regulatory pressure on Meta related to findings from the leaked internal documents, which have come to be known as the Facebook Papers. Earlier this week, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that it misled the public about its algorithm and the harms its apps can cause to users, causing losses for shareholders when those things were revealed. (Meta says the suit is without merit.) Senator Richard Blumenthal has also asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about the effects of Instagram on children. The Wall Street Journal first reported in September on what the company's own documents and research show about the potential harms to young people from its apps, and said Facebook knew Instagram was ""toxic"" for teen girls. In one internal report from 2019 on the mental health effects of Instagram cited by the Journal and reviewed by CNN Business, company researchers said ""we make body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls."" Meta has also pushed back on the Journal's reporting, and said its apps do more good than harm.  Following the Journal's report, a Senate subcommittee called a hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone Davis, where lawmakers grilled her on Instagram's effects on kids. Davis said the company was ""looking for ways to release more research"" that she suggested might paint a different picture about the platform. Haugen has also testified to lawmakers that she believes Meta's platforms ""harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.""  The company announced it was pausing plans to develop a version of Instagram designed for kids in late September, amid the fallout from the Journal report.  ""While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we've decided to pause this project,"" Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote in a blog post at the time. ""This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.""

107," (CNN Business)Activision Blizzard's longtime CEO Bobby Kotick is facing mounting pressure from employees to step down amid the company's ongoing sexual harassment scandal.More than 800 Activision Blizzard workers so far have signed a petition calling for Kotick's resignation. The petition, released on Thursday by a group of employees, says they ""no longer have confidence"" in Kotick's leadership. ""We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders,"" the petition added.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) — which owns hugely popular titles such as ""Call of Duty,"" ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Candy Crush"" — has been roiled by a sexual harassment and discrimination scandal for months and is currently under scrutiny from multiple government agencies.An Activision Blizzard spokesperson said in response to the petition that the company was ""fully committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and rewarding environment"" for its 9,500 employees worldwide. ""We support employees' rights to express their opinions and concerns in a safe and respectful manner, without fear of retaliation,"" the spokesperson added. The petition comes two days after more than 100 employees organized a walkout demanding Kotick step down. That walkout, the company's second in less than six months, came in response to a Wall Street Journal investigation indicating the CEO was aware of the company's harassment and discrimination issues for several years. The report cited internal company documents and people familiar with the matter. Kotick said in a statement to employees that the Journal story ""paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership."" He added that ""anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn't really appreciate how important this is to me.""While the report prompted renewed tension with some employees, Activision Blizzard's board of directors has so far stuck by Kotick. ""The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick's leadership, commitment and ability"" to address the company's longstanding and ongoing issues with harassment and discrimination, it said in a statement Tuesday.Kotick, who has been Activision CEO since 1991, including at the time of the 2008 merger with Blizzard, has been in damage control mode for most of this year.Last month, he announced an intention to slash his controversial $155 million pay package — one of the largest in corporate America — to the ""lowest amount California law will allow"" until the gaming company fixes its issues with gender discrimination and harassment. If the board approves, Kotick will be paid $62,500, he said.",2
108,"Seoul (CNN Business)Tim Sweeney is on a mission. The Epic Games CEO has been mounting a relentless attack on Apple, after the tech giant kicked his company's hugely popular video game Fortnite off the App Store. Apple said at the time that Epic flouted rules on digital payments by establishing its own system.Epic sued Apple in response, kicking off a highly public trial. Apple has argued that its rigid payments system exists to protect the security and privacy of its developers and customers, and that it's only a small part of the video game market — and therefore has no monopoly. Sweeney sees things differently. Companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL), he argues, wield enormous power over the app market. Their control prevents consumers and companies from choosing how they do business.The case is still working its way through US courts, but in September a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside its App Store. Still, the judge stopped short of calling Apple a monopoly, and the company has barred Fortnite from its devices until the legal battle finishes, which could delay the game's return to iPhones by several years.CNN Business caught up with Sweeney in Seoul, where he was attending the Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness — an event hosted by South Korean lawmaker Jo Seounglae. The country recently enacted a law that allows app developers to use alternative payment systems. We asked Sweeney questions about that law, as well as his ongoing fight with Apple, Fortnite's failed foray into China and his thoughts on the ""metaverse,"" the virtual world Facebook (FB) sees as its future. Our Q&A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.South Korea recently passed a bill banning mandatory in-app purchases and ordering tech companies to allow alternative payments. What did you think?I was very happy to see that Korea was taking the leadership role, initially. Korea is one of the leading technology powerhouses in the world, with Samsung (SSNLF) and all the great game developers around Korea. It's great to see Korea really defending developers, including all the Korean developers against these bad practices [by] Apple and Google. How much business and revenue has Epic Games lost as a result of getting kicked off Apple's ecosystem?Fortnite had made hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Fortnite being off of iOS, it's losing that much now. But fortunately, Fortnite is also successful on personal computers and game consoles. So the business continues to be strong, despite being off of iOS. But it just shows how much power Apple wields and is able to completely eliminate a game's existence on iOS. No platform company should have that power, right? Consumers should be free to install software. And developers should be free to create software, and the platform company should never stand in between them.Do you have any regrets about how the legal battles with Apple and Google have played out?We always knew it would be a slow and complex case. Both Apple and Epic realized from the beginning that whatever happened within the District Court ... the decision would be appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court in the United States, and, if possible, to the United States Supreme Court, to ultimately make the decision. And so, it was inevitable that this would take many years.Do you have anything to say to the people who have influence over this issue in the United States? Ultimately, this is a battle for consumer rights. Though the disputes are mostly between companies and governments, it's about the right of a smartphone owner to be able to install software from sources of their choosing, and to do business directly with developers without the platform company adding taxes and fees to every transaction. ... It's about the basic freedom of everybody to do business together directly if they choose. I think it's the most important fight for digital rights in the industry right now. Because more and more of our lives are moving online and becoming digital — all of our digital interactions are increasingly controlled by Google and Apple. If we allow the world's two most powerful corporations to control our online lives, it'll become a force that's more powerful than the government itself.Epic spent a long time working on Fortnite's launch in China, but it didn't happen. Was that time and effort worth it?I'm glad we tried. There's always been a lot of uncertainty about the future of US-China relations, and unfortunately, they've been strained for the past few years. And we just didn't see a realistic likelihood of being able to receive approval to launch in China. So we gave up trying, but I think it was a good effort.The team did a wonderful job, and I wish there had been a way, but I think there's just going to be a long period in which there's a separation between consumer services inside China and globally.What is the ""metaverse"" to you?It is real time 3D entertainment experiences that are social. It's you and your friends together in a 3D world, having fun in lots of different ways. You can be playing games like Fortnite Battle Royale, you can be going to concerts, you can be dancing, or you can just be standing around and chatting. It's all the sorts of social interactions we can have in real time 3D together with our group of friends.What kind of future do you envision in the metaverse? Is it really going to be a game changer, like the internet was when it was introduced?I think it will take a decade or more to really get to the end point, but I think that is happening. And it will be a better online experience than we're having today. It will succeed because it's better. The metaverse doesn't require fancy new hardware. It doesn't require all that reality hardware or [virtual reality] or things that haven't been invented yet. You can get online and start experiencing this right now.The next step of this metaverse evolution is to open up broader experiences to bring in the next billion users.What are some of the biggest hurdles to making it happen?The metaverse isn't going to be created by one company. It will be created by millions of developers each building out their part of it.Another challenge is building the economy. In order to have millions of developers building for the metaverse, you need to have a business where they can make as much or more money from that effort, developing software to support their businesses.We need to win the fight against platform monopolies, because Apple and Google currently have rules in place to prevent the metaverse from existing on the Google Play Store and on iOS. They have rules that prevent web browsers from existing — you're only allowed to use their web browser.They don't allow commerce to be done directly with users. They don't allow code to be run on your local device if it hasn't been reviewed by Apple and Google. The metaverse needs to support all of these things, so we really need to win this battle to open up platforms before the metaverse can truly exist.-- Rishi Iyengar and Jill Disis contributed to this report.",2
109," (CNN)The hesitancy of many people to get a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday.""Those who are vaccine hesitant have had their hesitancy enhanced by a variety of things that are happening right now, particularly the unfortunate mix of science and politics,"" Collins said at an event hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than half of respondents -- 54% -- said they would not get the vaccine if it was available for free before the November 3 presidential election. Along party lines, 60% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they would not. Half of Democrats said they would. ""I don't want to have us, a year from now, having a conversation about how we have in our hands the solution to the worst pandemic of more than 100 years, but we haven't been able to actually convince people to take charge of it,"" Collins said.People need to understand that if not enough people get vaccinated, a vaccine won't help reduce the spread of the virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.""It's a combination of how effective a vaccine is and how many people use it,"" he said. ""If you have a vaccine that is highly effective and not enough people get vaccinated, you're not going to realize the full, important effect of having a vaccine.""The less protective a vaccine is, the more people need to get it to provide population-wide immunity, Fauci said.President Donald Trump has said a vaccine could be available before the election November 3, and on Wednesday he said a vaccine could be released by mid-October. Fauci said he still thinks it will be the final months of the year before a vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.''I would still put my money on November/December,"" Fauci said during a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute panel on global pandemics.The CDC head gave a timeline. The President disputed itThe timeline for a Covid vaccine became a major headline Wednesday, when Trump challenged assertions by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Dr. Robert Redfield said earlier that a ""very limited supply"" of a vaccine might be ready in November or December, but it would have to be prioritized for first responders and those at greatest risk for death.""If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at third, late second quarter, third quarter 2021,"" Redfield told a Senate appropriations subcommittee.On top of that, ""in order to have enough of us immunized so we have immunity, I think it's going to take us six to nine months,"" he said.In the meantime, ""These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,"" Redfield said, holding up a blue face mask, adding that masks may offer more protection than a vaccine. Trump said Redfield was ""confused"" in his testimony. ""I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information,"" Trump said about Redfield's vaccine timeline.The President also said Redfield's comments to Congress about masks possibly being more effective than a vaccine were incorrect and that Redfield may have misunderstood the question.""Maybe he misunderstood it,"" Trump said, later adding, ""As far as the masks are concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks.""A CDC spokesman said in a statement that Redfield was answering a question he thought was in regard to the time period in which all Americans would have completed their Covid vaccination, and his estimate was by the second or third quarter of 2021.""He was not referring to the time period when Covid-19 vaccine doses would be made available to all Americans,"" the spokesman said.In a later statement, Redfield said that he believes in the ""importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a Covid-19 vaccine.""Distrust is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spreadDistrust in government agencies is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,"" he said during an American Public Health Association webinar.Surveillance helps public health officials by collecting information on infected people, such as where they were exposed and who they've been in contact with, and the course of their illness. Fauci said the variability in how the coronavirus affects people has helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.""One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently... propagating the outbreak..."" Fauci said during a virtual panel sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Fauci said he has ""never seen anything with a range"" like this virus.""It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,"" he said.7 coronavirus deaths are linked to 1 weddingA wedding in Maine is linked to 176 Covid-19 cases and the deaths of seven people who didn't attend the celebration -- showing just how easily and quickly coronavirus can spread at social gatherings, public health experts say.  For months, doctors have stressed the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. But outbreaks have stemmed from Memorial Day events, Fourth of July celebrations and a massive motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.The wedding in Millinocket on August 7 had about 65 guests, a violation of the state's 50-person limit for indoor events, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.The event is linked to outbreaks that have unfolded at a nursing home and a jail, both more than 100 miles away from the wedding venue, among people who had only secondary or tertiary contact with an attendee. Residents at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center accounted for 39 cases tied to the wedding and six of the seven deaths thus far, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said.""The virus favors gatherings,"" Shah added. ""It does not distinguish between happy events like a wedding celebration, or sad farewells, like a funeral.""Despite such somber warnings, about 1,500 people descended on a New Jersey boardwalk house featured in MTV's ""Jersey Shore"" on Monday night, ending in eight arrests, Seaside Heights police said. The event was organized by a group of YouTube pranksters, according to Seaside Heights Police Detective Steve Korman, and officials say they are now worried about how they will track possible infections among more than a thousand people.Universities try to get ahead of outbreaksOutbreaks keep cropping up at colleges and universities, prompting some to go to virtual learning again. More than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at colleges and universities in all 50 states. Citing a significant rise in cases among students, the University of Colorado Boulder announced a 14-day quarantine period for students living within the city.The University of Arizona is taking a similar approach, urging students to shelter in place until the end of the month after a large number of positive cases. The university reported 261 positive cases on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard.At the University of Missouri, two students were expelled and three were suspended for violating rules that require students who test positive to isolate and comply with social distancing.""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable. We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students,"" the university said in a statement Tuesday.",2
110," (CNN)President Donald Trump knew back in the spring that it would probably take a year to develop a coronavirus vaccine, according to interviews with journalist Bob Woodward.Trump also suggests that's why he initially pushed so hard for the use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, because the malaria drug had already been tested and approved for other uses.""Well, we're doing great on vaccines,"" Woodward quotes Trump as saying in his latest book, ""Rage.""""The problem with a vaccine is a vaccine will take 13 to 14 months once you have it. Because you have to test a vaccine. As opposed to the hydroxy, you have to test it. Because the hydroxy's been there for 25 years.""Hydroxychloroquine was indeed an approved drug, but it had never been tested in people with coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration gave hydroxychloroquine emergency use approval but later rescinded it after several studies showed the drug did not help patients were coronavirus and might be harmful.Trump heavily promoted hydroxychloroquine for months but after the FDA rescinded the EUA, began talking about development of a vaccine. He has repeatedly said he believes a vaccine could be approved before the Nov. 3 election.His interviews with Woodward -- also recorded on audiotapes -- show he was briefed on the timetable for a coronavirus vaccine. The US government had been working with vaccine makers, including Moderna Inc, and Johnson & Johnson, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The new vaccines are made using pieces of genetic material and researchers started testing the first vaccines in human clinical trials in March.""We probably already have the vaccine,"" Trump said on April 13, according to the book. ""You know the biggest problem though? You have to test it, so you have to make sure it kills the virus, but you've got to make sure it doesn't kill the person. Can you imagine? You vaccinate a hundred million people and you find out it's poison, right?""Administration officials have told CNN that in meetings focused on vaccine development throughout the spring and summer, Trump consistently pressed officials to speed up the timeline for developing a vaccine, and the President appeared intent on being able to deliver at least the solid promise of an effective vaccine by the time he faces reelection.Those efforts have scaled up as Election Day nears, and Trump has repeatedly complained that some officials at federal health agencies are actively working to stymie his reelection chances by slow-walking announcements.""It will be delivered before the end of the year, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October,"" Trump said about a vaccine at a rally this month. ""How do you like that? Wouldn't that be nice? And you know why? Not because of the election. It'd be nice because we want to save people.""Trump's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has denied there's pressure on the FDA ""to do anything.""",2
111," (CNN)President Donald Trump has defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic many times before, but on Tuesday he faced his most threatening critics yet — undecided voters.A version of this story appeared in the September 16 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.At an ABC town hall in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, the President hit back at a question over his remarks to renowned journalist Bob Woodward that he deliberately downplayed the threat of the virus, despite knowing the risks.""Well I didn't downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it in terms of action,"" he claimed in response to a question at the town hall. He pointed to his government's travel bans on China and Europe as examples of ""very strong"" action.It was an invitation to the audience to refuse to believe their own ears, as Stephen Collinson writes. Trump repeatedly told Americans the virus would ""just disappear,"" and he privately told Woodward in mid-March: ""I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.""Trump and the White House have been widely criticized for flouting government guidelines designed to limit the transmission of Covid-19, including social distancing and wearing a mask. On Tuesday, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain at the White House to sign normalization agreements between Israel and the two Arab countries.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYChildren from ethnic-minority groups hit harderA new report confirms that while deaths in kids infected with Covid-19 are very rare, children and teens from ethnic-minority groups are disproportionately impacted. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly report Tuesday that while Hispanic, Black, Native American and Asian or Pacific people represented 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age group.If rich countries get the vaccine first, twice as many people will die: studyNew modelling from Northeastern University shows that a coordinated vaccine response that provides countries with a number of doses proportionate to their population will save twice as many lives than if rich countries were prioritized.If the vaccine is distributed based on population numbers, it could avert 61% of global deaths. But if higher numbers of doses are given to wealthier countries, just 33% of deaths could be prevented. The US and China are among nations that have not joined an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine ahead of a deadline on Friday.It may be 2022 before we can start thinking about 'normal life' againThat's the stark warning from the World Health Organization's chief science officer, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, who said there needs to be  60% to 70% of the population with immunity before a dramatic reduction in viral transmission is realistic. ""We're looking at 2022 at least before enough people start getting the vaccine to build immunity.""A WHO special envoy, David Nabarro, also warned that the pandemic has just begun. ""This is really serious -- we're not even in the middle of it yet,"" he told British lawmakers. ""And it's getting nastier as we go into this particular phase in Europe of watching the thing come back again.""ON OUR RADARCountries heading into winter will have to choose between having bars and nightclubs open, or schools in session, the WHO has warned.France appears to be entering its second wave of Covid-19, and doctors at one hospital in Bordeaux say this one is going to be a marathon.India topped 5 million coronavirus cases Wednesday, after confirming 1 million new infections in just 11 days.Top spokesperson for the US Department of Health, Michael Caputo, has apologized after a scathing rant in which he accused government scientists of ""sedition"" in their coronavirus responses.Covid-19 may have circulated in the US as early as December, about a month earlier than widely believed, according to UCLA researchers. TODAY'S TOP TIPIn times of stress, we often turn to comforting sugary indulgences. Cutting sugar comes down to knowing how much is in what you eat and drink.

112,"Bordeaux, France (CNN)Dealing with the first wave was like a sprint, the second will be more like a marathon.That's how Dr. Olivier Joannes-Boyau, head of the intensive care unit at University Hospital in the southwestern city of Bordeaux, describes the resurgence of Covid-19 in France. After young French people took advantage of the lifting of lockdown and summer months to socialize freely, Covid-19 hospitalizations have risen in large cities like Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille on the Mediterranean coast. French hospitals are now preparing for the long slog.The last time University Hospital dealt with a rise in Covid-19 cases, it put aside all other emergency procedures to deal the crisis. This time, it is trying to keep the rest of its services going too. Just like the wider country, it is adapting to a virus that looks like it is here to stay.Hospital staff are more experienced than they were when the coronavirus first swept through France, and Bordeaux University Hospital is now armed with steroids to reduce Covid-19 symptoms and improved ventilators, both of which can reduce intubation rates.But juggling the swelling number of Covid-19 patients alongside those with other conditions will be difficult, says Dr. Catherine Fleureau, the hospital's director. ""It's also going to be harder than last time, because this wave, I think, will grow progressively and then last over time.""Earlier this year, the first coronavirus wave spiked fast, but was cut short by a strict nationwide lockdown. In total more than 31,000 people died from the disease in France, out of over 433,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Now, the number of new cases is rising fast. A record was set over the weekend with more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. The number of clusters has been rising steadily and, most worryingly, nationwide, the number of people in intensive care has risen 25% in the past week. That number is still 10 times lower than they it was in the spring but it is a worrying trend; like in the spring it will be about how fast the numbers move upwards.The French government is determined to avoid a second general lockdown that could cripple its economy, so is tasking local authorities with responsibility for reducing the virus's spread.In response, Bordeaux and Marseille have tightened their Covid-19 regulations, extending the places where masks must be worn, limiting the size of public gatherings and hardening enforcement. More checks are to be carried out to ensure that Covid-19 regulations are being respected.In Bordeaux, the plan announced by regional officials includes a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in public parks, along the river banks and on beaches. In cafes and restaurants clients will no longer be able to eat and drink while standing up. In both cities regional officials lowered the number of people allowed to gather for large events to 1,000 from 5,000 previously, resulting in the cancellation of sporting fixtures.And just since the start of the school year, 81 schools and 2,100 classes have had to close due to Covid cases. Minister for Education Jean-Michel Blanquer also said Wednesday 1,200 new infections among students had been recorded, compared to last week. The success of these measures will dictate the number of patients that ultimately reach doctors like Dr. Joannes-Boyau. ""The major problem will be to keep the wave, really low,"" he says. ""Because if this wave grows a lot, we will face a large number of patients with Covid-19 that will come and we will not able to treat them.""It's too early to judge whether local restrictions can keep the coming wave manageable, but his intensive care unit is already nearing capacity, with 33 of the 35 available ICU beds occupied on Wednesday. As Joannes-Boyau says, it takes about three weeks for any change in the state of a population's health to be measurable. Now the city is braced to see if it has the endurance to last the marathon.An earlier version of this story incorrectly understated the number of ICU beds that were occupied in Bordeaux on Wednesday. It was 33.",2
113," (CNN)The deadly coronavirus may have circulated in the United States as early as December, about a month earlier than believed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to researchers with UCLA.Their study, published last Thursday in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, found a statistically significant increase in clinic and hospital visits by patients who reported respiratory illnesses as early as the week of December 22.The first known case of Covid-19 in the US was thought to be a patient in Washington who had visited Wuhan, China, according to the CDC. The case was reported in January. Dr. Joann Elmore and colleagues looked through nearly 10 million medical records from the UCLA Health system, including three hospitals and 180 clinics. Elmore said she started the search after receiving a number of emails from anxious patients in March through her clinic's patient portal at UCLA. Patients kept asking if the cough they had in January could have been Covid-19.""With the outpatients, I found a 50% increase in the percentage of patients coming in complaining of a cough. It came out to over 1,000 extra patients above the average of what we would typically see,"" Elmore told CNN.  The number of patient visits to the ER for respiratory complaints, as well as the number of people hospitalized with acute respiratory failure between December 2019 and February 2020, were all up, compared to records from the past five years. The uptick in cases started in the final week of December. ""Some of these cases could have been due to the flu, some could be for other reasons, but to see these kinds of higher numbers even in the outpatient setting is notable,"" Elmore said.Elmore hopes the research shows that real-time data collected on diseases like this could potentially help public health experts identify and track emerging outbreaks much earlier and potentially slow or stop the spread of disease.Dr. Claudia Hoyen, an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center who did not work on the study, said she believes it's possible Covid-19 may have been in the US much sooner than first realized.But Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research, disagreed.""We know from the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that the pandemic started in late November / early December in China so there's absolutely no way the virus could have been spreading widely in December 2019. From the same genetic data we know that widespread transmission didn't start in the United States until (around)  February 2020,"" Andersen said in an email.""The paper is picking up spurious signals and the hospitalizations are more likely from flu or other respiratory diseases,"" Andersen wrote. Parties and virus concerns keep high schoolers from returning to class Overcrowded parties have forced several high schools to go back to online learning in hopes of staving off Covid-19 outbreaks.Two of those schools are in Massachusetts, which is reporting fewer cases than last week, and New York, which has maintained an infection rate less than 1% for 38 days. Although the states' numbers are promising, experts have warned that people attending large gatherings are a serious threat to managing the spread of the virus that has infected more than 6.5 million and killed 195,275 people in the US.Student parties have already sent colleges and universities scrambling to manage outbreaks, and now high school administrators are working to avoid the same. A crowded student party ""that involved alcohol and complete lack of safety precautions"" pushed Lincoln-Sudbury High School outside of Boston to go back to remote learning the first two weeks of school, a letter from the superintendent said. And Pelham High School in Westchester, New York, has extended online learning after two nights in a row of students partying in the woods, the school district announced.But students' social lives are not the only cause for concern. The president of the United Federation of Teachers said Monday that New York City is ""not making the grade"" when it comes to enacting the safety measures needed to reopen schools for in-person learning.Michael Mulgrew cited insufficient staffing and a two to three day delay in testing results as major roadblocks.""If you asked me if we are ready to open today, I would say we are not,"" he said. In New York City Public Schools, at least 422,190 students have requested the entirely remote learning option for the fall, according to data provided by the city's Department of Education -- a little over 40% of the more than 1 million students enrolled in the nation's largest public school system. Roughly 58% of students plan to return to school buildings as part of a hybrid learning model beginning next week, according to the department.Parents in the New York City public school system could opt out of the in-person hybrid plan since it was first announced. In August, Mayor Bill de Blasio said 74% of families had said they were planning to participate in in person learning at the time. The city's daily Covid-19 indicators are all under desired thresholds, de Blasio said Tuesday.Schools plan ahead for safe reopeningsAs several schools make last minute changes to their plans in response to parties, others are implementing systems ahead of time to respond to changes in the virus. Kentucky officials outlined a color-coded system Monday to help individual districts determine every week if they should continue with in-person learning based on coronavirus levels in their area. ""If you're in the red, it means there's widespread community spread of COVID-19, and if you're in the red it's not responsible -- it is not responsible -- to be doing every day in-person learning,"" Gov. Andy Beshear said.And though students in the Los Angeles Unified School District are still learning remotely, a ""report card"" will show the number of cases in each school as part of the district's testing and tracing endeavor, Superintendent Austin Beutner said. To address childcare concerns, about 3,000 children of essential workers will be able to return to school in groups of six after being tested for the virus, Beutner said. States cracking down on large gatheringsSome states are doing their part to curb the spread and limit the number of fall and winter infections by cracking down on large gatherings. Officials from New York City parks and New York University are patrolling Washington Square Park and encouraging personal protective equipment use after two back to back weekends of parties with NYU students. After the first weekend gathering, Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the city's police and the university officials for not taking firmer action to stop the parties. NYU has instructed all residents and employees the Rubin Hall dormitory to quarantine until at least Tuesday night after the diagnosis of six positive cases out of roughly 400 students living in the building, the university announced in its latest campus update.""Out of an abundance of caution, we are also retesting all residents of Rubin Hall (and employees, too), and instructed them on Saturday to begin quarantining until at least Tuesday night,"" the university said. NYU has reported a total of 65 cases since August 1, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard — an overall positivity rate of .19%. The school has reported 48 cases in the most recent 14-day period, a positivity rate of .31%.The University of Missouri in Columbia has expelled two students and suspended three others for violating the school's Covid-19 rules, including ""requirements that COVID positive individuals isolate and comply with social distancing requirements,"" the university said Tuesday. ""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable,"" Chancellor and UM System President Mun Choi said in a statement, without elaborating on their alleged actions.""We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students.""MU has referred roughly 470 students to the Office of Student Conduct for possible Covid-19 safety violations since August 16, and 11 student organizations are currently under investigation. MU has 332 active cases among students, according to the university dashboard -- down from 700 active cases earlier this month. The school has reported more than 1,300 cases since August 19. On Monday, the University of Arizona -- in accordance with the local county health department -- strongly urged students to shelter in place until September 30, following an increase in positive Covid-19 cases.Exceptions include obtaining food, attending work, seeking medical treatment and going outside where social distancing is possible. The school limited in-person instruction to ""essential courses"" only until September 27. The University of Arizona reported 261 positive Covid-19 tests on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard, and has seen roughly 1,400 cases since July 31.Pennsylvania appealing court ruling on large gatherings In the face of possible fall and winter resurgence, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's office is appealing a federal court ruling that keeps the state from banning certain types of large gatherings. The state has instituted measures against indoor gatherings of more than 25 people and outdoor events with more than 250 people to stop the spread of coronavirus.The action is used by many governors across the US, said Wolf's press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger, and continues to ""save lives in the absence of federal action.""Connecticut has also had ordinances in place to prohibit large gatherings and require face masks in the time of coronavirus, but now law enforcement will have the authority to impose fines to enforce them, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday.People not wearing masks can be fined $100. Organizers of large gatherings can be fined $500, with those attending fined $250, Lamont said.Despite the importance of masks to halting the spread, White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said a national mask mandate ""probably would not work.""Speaking at a news conference with Vermont Gov. Phil Scott on Tuesday, Fauci said, ""There is such a degree of variability of accepting mandates throughout the country.""Fauci said issues arise when a majority of the population in an area do not agree with the mandate -- and that begs the question: How do you enforce the mandate?Anything that puts an ""authoritative statement to the citizenry often is met with a considerable amount of pushback,"" he said. Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, said in Geneva that countries approaching winter will have to choose between having bars and nightclubs open or schools in session.""We have to sustain pressure on this virus, we have to reduce transmission at community level in order to lower the risk to those older and vulnerable people and to maintain an environment in which our children can continue to attend school,"" Ryan said at a briefing.""So, what is more important? Are children back at school? Are the nightclubs and the bars open?"" he said. ""I think these are decisions that we have to make in coming into the winter months."" ",2
114," (Kaiser Health News)The Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to follow British regulators in resuming a coronavirus vaccine trial that was halted when a participant suffered spinal cord damage, even as the National Institutes of Health has launched an investigation of the case.""The highest levels of NIH are very concerned,"" said Dr. Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director and a leader of viral research at the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an NIH division. ""Everyone's hopes are on a vaccine, and if you have a major complication the whole thing could get derailed.""A great deal of uncertainty remains about what happened to the unnamed patient, to the frustration of those avidly following the progress of vaccine testing. AstraZeneca, which is running the global trial of the vaccine it produced with Oxford University, said the trial volunteer recovered from a severe inflammation of the spinal cord and is no longer hospitalized.AstraZeneca has not confirmed that the patient was afflicted with transverse myelitis, but Nath and another neurologist said they understood this to be the case. Transverse myelitis produces a set of symptoms involving inflammation along the spinal cord that can cause pain, muscle weakness and paralysis. Britain's regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, reviewed the case and has allowed the trial to resume in the United Kingdom.AstraZeneca ""need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people,"" said Nath. ""We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so.""Any decision about whether to continue the trial is complex because it's difficult to assess the cause of a rare injury that occurs during a vaccine trial — and because scientists and authorities have to weigh the risk of uncommon side effects against a vaccine that might curb the pandemic.""So many factors go into these decisions,"" Nath said. ""I'm sure everything is on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt healthy people.""The NIH has yet to get tissue or blood samples from the British patient, and its investigation is ""in the planning stages,"" Nath said. U.S. scientists could look at samples from other vaccinated patients to see whether any of the antibodies they generated in response to the coronavirus also attack brain or spinal cord tissue.Such studies might take a month or two, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it would take before it decides whether to move forward.Dr. Jesse Goodman, a Georgetown University professor and physician who was chief scientist and lead vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency will review the data and possibly consult with British regulators before allowing resumption of the U.S. study, which had just begun when the injury was reported. Two other coronavirus vaccines are also in late-stage trials in the U.S.If it determines the injury in the British trial was caused by the vaccine, the FDA could pause the trial. If it allows it to resume, regulators and scientists surely will be on the watch for similar symptoms in other trial participants.A volunteer in an earlier phase of the AstraZeneca trial experienced a similar side effect, but investigators discovered she had multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccination, according to Dr. Elliot Frohman, director of the Multiple Sclerosis & Neuroimmunology Center at the University of Texas.Neurologists who study illnesses like transverse myelitis say they are rare — occurring at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250,000 people — and strike most often as a result of the body's immune response to a virus. Less frequently, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines.The precise cause of the disease is key to the decision by authorities whether to resume the trial. Sometimes an underlying medical condition is ""unmasked"" by a person's immune response to the vaccine, leading to illness, as happened with the MS patient. In that case, the trial might be continued without fear, because the illness was not specific to the vaccine.More worrisome is a phenomenon called ""molecular mimicry."" In such cases, some small piece of the vaccine may be similar to tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on that tissue in response to a vaccine component. Should that be the case, another occurrence of transverse myelitis would be likely if the trial resumed, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A second case would shut down the trial, he said.In 1976, a massive swine flu vaccination program was halted when doctors began diagnosing a similar disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, in people who received the vaccine. At the time no one knew how common GBS was, so it was difficult to tell whether the episodes were related to the vaccine.Eventually, scientists found that the vaccine increased the risk of the disorder by an additional one case among every 100,000 vaccinated patients. Typical seasonal flu vaccination raises the risk of GBS in about one additional case in every 1 million people.""It's very, very hard"" to determine if one rare event was caused by a vaccine, Schaffner said. ""How do you attribute an increased risk for something that occurs in one in a million people?""Before allowing U.S. trials to restart, the FDA will want to see why the company and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) in the U.K. felt it was safe to continue, Goodman said. The AstraZeneca trial in the United States has a separate safety board.FDA officials will need to review full details of the case and may request more information about the affected study volunteer before deciding whether to allow the U.S. trial to continue, Goodman said. They may also require AstraZeneca to update the safety information it provides to study participants.It's possible that the volunteer's health problem was a coincidence unrelated to the vaccine, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Studies aren't usually stopped over a single health problem, even if it's serious.Yet many health leaders have expressed frustration that AstraZeneca hasn't released more information about the health problem that led it to halt its U.K. trial.""There is just so little information about this that it's impossible to understand what the diagnosis was or why the DSMB and sponsor were reassured"" that it was safe to continue, Goodman said.AstraZeneca has said it's unable to provide more information about the health problem, saying this would violate patient privacy, although it didn't say how.But there's an exceptional need for transparency in a political climate rife with vaccine hesitancy and mistrust of the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 response, leading scientists say.""While I respect the critical need for patient confidentiality, I think it would be really helpful to know what their assessment of these issues was,"" Goodman said. ""What was the diagnosis? If there wasn't a clear diagnosis, what is it that led them to feel the trial could be restarted? There is so much interest and potential concern about a COVID-19 vaccine that the more information that can be provided, the more reassuring that would be.""The FDA will need to balance any possible risks from an experimental vaccine with the danger posed by COVID-19, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.""There are also potential consequences if you stop a study,"" Goodman said.If the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the U.S. government is supporting six other COVID vaccines in the hope at least one will succeed. The potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine show this to be a wise investment, Adalja said.""This is part of the idea of not having just one vaccine candidate going forward,"" he said. ""It gives you a little more insurance.""Schaffner said researchers need to remember that vaccine research is unpredictable.""The investigators have inadvisedly been hyping their own vaccine,"" Schaffner said. ""The Oxford investigators were out there this summer saying, 'We're going to get there first.' But this is exactly the sort of reason ... Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and the rest of us have been saying, 'You never know what will happen once you get into large-scale human trials.'""",2
115," (CNN)Children and teens from minority groups are disproportionately hit by coronavirus, just as older adults are, according to the findings of a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children from ethnic and racial minorities, those with underlying health conditions and those between the ages of 18 and 20 are more likely to die, a CDC-led research team wrote in a study published Tuesday in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.  The report also showed just how unusual it is for children and young adults to die from coronavirus. Among the 190,000 deaths tallied in the country, only 0.08% -- or 121 -- were reported in those under 21. The most updated report from the CDC shows 377 children, teens and young adults aged up to 24 have died from coronavirus. The researchers asked 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands to submit information on coronavirus deaths in those under 21, between February 12 and July 31. Forty-seven jurisdictions responded. Among the approximately 6.5 million Covid-19 cases in the country, the researchers found a total of 391,814 cases of Covid-19 and MIS-C in those under 21. While people under 21 make up 26% of the US population, they make up only 8% of all reported cases.  Hispanics, Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives were disproportionately affected.  A total of 44% of the 121 who died were Hispanic children, 29% were Black children, 4% were American Indian/Alaska Natives and 4% were Asian or Pacific Islander. While these groups represent 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age range. Fourteen percent of the deaths were in white children. ""Infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, particularly those from racial and ethnic minority groups at higher risk, those with underlying medical conditions, and their caregivers, need clear, consistent, and developmentally, linguistically, and culturally appropriate COVID-19 prevention messages,"" the researchers wrote. While 25% of the deaths were in previously healthy children, 75% had at least one underlying health condition and 45% had two or more. The most frequently reported medical conditions were chronic lung disease, including asthma; obesity; neurologic and developmental conditions and cardiovascular conditions.  The breakdown among the different age groups varied substantially, with those in the younger age groups doing better than adolescents and young adults. Approximately 10% of the deaths were in infants under the age of 1, an additional 9% were in children between 1 and 4, with another 11% in the 5-9 range and 10% in the 10-13 range. But almost 20% of the deaths were seen in teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 and more than 40% were in 18 to 20 year-olds.  This matches up somewhat with earlier CDC statistics that found 0 to 4-year-olds are four times less likely to be hospitalized and nine times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds, and 5 to 17-year-olds are nine times less likely to be hospitalized and 16 times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds.  Boys fared worse than girls: males accounted for 63% of the deaths compared with 37% for females.  Even though children are reassuringly less likely to get severely ill and die, they can still get infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, according to numerous studies.  For example, in one study published last week in the MMWR, researchers analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care facilities in Salt Lake County from April to July. They found at least two children who had no symptoms not only caught the virus, but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One eight-month-old baby infected both parents.  ""The infected children exposed at these three facilities had mild to no symptoms. Two of three asymptomatic children likely transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to their parents and possibly to their teachers,"" the researchers from the Salt Lake County Health Department wrote in their report. Another study out of South Korea analyzed data on 91 asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic children diagnosed with Covid-19 between February 18 and March 31 at 22 centers throughout that country. It found that 22% of the children were asymptomatic. The study was published at the end of August in JAMA Pediatrics. ""This highlights the concept that infected children may be more likely to go unnoticed either with or without symptoms and continue on with their usual activities, which may contribute to viral circulation within their community,"" wrote two doctors from Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, in an accompanying editorial.  The CDC researchers of the current study said it is important to keep a close eye on children infected with Covid-19. ""Although infants, children, and adolescents are more likely to have milder COVID-19 illness than are adults, complications, including MIS-C and respiratory failure, do occur in these populations. Persons infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be followed closely so that clinical deterioration can be detected early,"" they wrote. ",2
116," (CNN)Eli Lipman, 9, and his father have been battling the impact of Covid-19 since March, and he said life as a ""long hauler"" isn't easy.""Kids, I'm sorry to say this, but it is a big deal. It will hurt,"" Eli told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday. ""You just got to face the truth: Sometimes you're not OK.""Eli and his father, Jonathan Lipman, are among a growing population of people who have been deemed ""long haulers"" -- people who are diagnosed with coronavirus and experience symptoms for months.Though research has found children face a small risk of severe illness from coronavirus.Eli described being achy, sore and tired. He said he felt like he ""got smashed into a wall.""But as fatigued as he is and as much as he wants to, Eli told Cuomo he can't sleep.""My body is just like 'nope,'"" Eli said.Lipman said doctors initially brushed Eli and his illnesses off many times. First in their diagnosis, then when their symptoms persisted and even when Eli's temperature stayed at a low-grade fever for months. ""No one would really believe us that we were still sick, and when you keep being not believed you stop believing yourself,"" Lipman said.Lipman is still fighting the symptoms, too. He said most mornings he wakes up with aches similar to when he broke his shoulder. He can't go up the stairs without gasping and can't even cook dinner for his family like he so enjoys doing, because he falls asleep.Dr. William Li, who is researching long-hauler patients, said that while there is still so much more to learn, the problem likely involves the blood vessels. ""One of the important things is to keep talking to your doctor, and doctors need to keep listening to your patients,"" Li said. ""There is really something unfolding before our eyes that we need before our eyes that we need to actually come together with our patients and with ourselves as researchers and as doctors to try to help heal.""Li recommended that, in addition to regular conversation with doctors, long haulers need to get as much sleep, movement and leafy greens as possible.",2
117," (CNN)Sibling rivalry is often taken as an unexamined fact of family life -- as much a part of parenting as potty training or bedtime stories.But experts say parents don't have to put up with the bickering and the fights: There are strategies and techniques to help brothers and sisters get along better, strengthening a relationship that will support them for life and make for a more harmonious home.Given the enforced proximity that is still a reality for many during the Covid-19 pandemic, a game plan to improve sibling relationships could be a lifesaver for struggling parents tired of snarled insults and hurled objects. ""It's been part of our culture, at least in the US, to think that siblings fight. That there's going to be lots of times they don't get along. That's what they do,"" said Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University in Boston.""When social lives are so restricted, families really see the value of encouraging their kids to be friends, in some respects, to be companions and playmates.""Unlike many of our relationships, we don't choose our siblings, and this makes for a unique dynamic. Brothers and sisters can withstand far more negativity and behavior that simply wouldn't fly among friends, Kramer said. That's one reason why sibling interactions are developmentally so important. These relationships allow children to try out new social and emotional behavior, particularly when it comes to conflict, helping them learn ways to manage emotions and develop awareness of other people's thoughts and feelings.""It's helpful for children to have experiences in a very safe relationship with a brother or sister where they can work through (conflict) and learn conflict management skills that they will be able to use in other relationships in their life,"" Kramer said.  ""Conflict can be very constructive and helpful. It helps children get a sense of who they are and their own identity.""It's worth parents spending some time to help their children get along since these are typically the longest-lasting of our close relationships. That shared history can be really important in a crisis.  So what steps should you take to help feuding siblings get along? Here are some ideas. One-on-one timeIt may sound counterintuitive, but scheduling regular one-on-one time with your children is a good first move. ""When you have one-on-one time there is no competition for your attention. There are no perceived winners and losers in this regard,"" said family therapist Jonathan Caspi, a professor in the department of family science and human development at Montclair State University in New Jersey.""There is the ability to praise and correct without the audience (and it having any meaning) for the other children. It's a freer relationship and one in which bonding and closeness can be developed without interference,"" he said via email.Another tip: While it's tempting to seize the moments they do get along to get things done, it's important to take a moment and praise siblings when they are cooperating and playing nicely -- parent the good behavior as well as the bad. Intervene or ignore?Tougher to deal with are the fights and knowing when to intervene or not. As a rule, Caspi said, it's better to ignore simple bickering. However, he stressed that physical violence and the name calling that often precedes it should be policed.""Since violence escalates incrementally in its severity, it is important that parents stop verbal violence before it becomes physical. Name calling is violence and opens the door for escalation into more severe violence.""""Do not allow your children to call each other curse words or negative terms like 'fat,' 'stupid,' 'icky,' etc.  While physical wounds heal, verbal ones can last a lifetime."" Children under the age of 8 don't usually have the skills to manage conflict, said Kramer, who encouraged parents to act as mediators or coaches to facilitate solving the problem at hand rather than serving as a referee. ""What happens when parents do nothing and don't intervene is that children can get the message that parents think what you're doing is OK. That it's all right to keep on at one another,"" she said.""We encourage parents to intervene to help children manage conflict on their own.""For example, Kramer suggested saying something along the following line: ""I'm hearing some scuffling. I'm hearing some conflict. I'd like for the two of you to work this out together. If you need some help, I'm down the hall but let's see what you can do on your own.""It was once thought that girls used more verbal aggression than boys, Caspi said, but research is suggesting that sisters are just as apt to use physical violence as much as brothers. ""The difference may be how severe the physical violence gets. Boys tend to do more damage, particularly when older,"" he said via email. ""It was also assumed that girls relied more on relational aggression (e.g., strategies to socially humiliate, isolating, injure reputation) than boys. However, there is evidence that brothers use this approach about the same too.""What not to doThe danger with intervening or involving yourself in children's disagreements is that it can backfire and fuel the fighting. Parents tend to intervene on behalf of the younger child, which builds more resentment in the older and empowers the younger to challenge the older more frequently, Caspi said. Avoid phrases like  ""You're bigger, be nice!"" ""Be a good role model,"" or ""She's little, let her have the toy.""""Another reason for bickering is parents who make lots of comparisons. Parents should avoid comparing their children. Children hear the comparisons and it creates more competition and fighting,"" he said. It's also important to take complaints seriously. For example, if a child consistently complains, ""It's not fair"" -- something I find particularly challenging in dealing with my own daughters.""When children complain about fairness, parents often dismiss it ... which only confirms the sense that they are on the outside in the parent-children relationship. Acknowledge the feelings and openly discuss it,"" Caspi said.""Parents should observe how they intervene in sibling conflicts. Are you taking one's side more than the other's?  If so, change it up,"" he said. Lastly, and perhaps most crucially, both Caspi and Kramer said that it's important for parents to cut themselves some slack and take care of their own mental health. Kids can pick up on stress and tension, and this may lead to more fights.""Parents are stretched in so many different ways right now,"" Kramer said.",2
118," (CNN)Dr. Umair Shah remembers the last mass vaccination campaign the US waged.  It was in 2009, when the H1N1 ""swine"" flu broke out in April, right at the end of the regular flu season. ""That was very challenging,"" Shah, who heads the Harris County, Texas, health department, told CNN. ""There were a lot of moving pieces. It took several weeks to months to not just organize but to implement and to do safely and effectively. And that was a mild pandemic."" This is not a mild pandemic. And while vaccine manufacturers, public health experts and the federal government are all confident one or more of the coronavirus vaccines being tested now will be shown to work safely by the end of the year, the US and the world will still be a long way from ending the pandemic. ""I feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this calendar year, as we get into early 2021,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, who, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is helping lead the medical battle against the virus, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual,"" Fauci added. ""Having"" a vaccine does not mean having a vaccine approved, distributed and into the arms of more than 300 million Americans.First, any vaccine must either be approved or authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. That's a process that under normal circumstances can take months or years. While the FDA has promised a speedier process for a Covid-19 vaccine, it must still go through a committee known as the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBAC. The FDA will almost certainly allow a shortcut process known as emergency use authorization, or EUA, but the agency has said it will require an ""EUA-plus"" that adds at least some layers of scrutiny. ""It's unlikely that a Covid-19 vaccine will receive full approval and broad distribution right away. Instead, the FDA will probably authorize vaccines for use in targeted groups of people at high risk from Covid and most likely to benefit from the vaccine,"" Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, both former FDA commissioners, wrote in a commentary in the Wall Street Journal Monday. ""All this means that at least initially, Covid vaccines won't provide the sort of herd immunity that can help extinguish an epidemic.""  That will take time -- likely well into next year, even if a vaccine were to be authorized in January, most experts who spoke to CNN predicted. ""People can't be lulled into a false sense of security by knowing the vaccine is coming,"" Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, told CNN. Although manufacturers are already making vaccine doses, it takes time. And the US will likely need more than 600 million doses of vaccine -- enough for everyone to get two doses of the vaccine. A new vaccine, and a plan for getting it out""Let's say ... at the end of the year, there will be millions and tens of millions of doses available,"" Fauci said in the CNN interview Friday.   ""It won't be until we get into 2021 that you'll have hundreds of millions of doses, and just the logistics constraints in vaccinating large numbers of people -- it's going to take months to get enough people vaccinated to have an umbrella of immunity over the community."" The US just is not ready for a mass vaccination campaign like the one needed to bring coronavirus under control, public health experts agreed. ""I don't think it's going to be seamless,"" said Plescia. The biggest mass vaccination program the US undertakes every year is the annual influenza vaccine. Only about half of Americans get a flu vaccine, and manufacturers make and distribute fewer than 150 million doses of it. Yet it takes a full year from start to finish to formulate, make and distribute flu vaccines every influenza season.  ""We start planning for flu vaccines in January or February,"" Michael Einhorn, the president of Dealmed, an independent medical supply distributor covering New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Flu vaccines generally become available in August -- seven to eight months later. And that's with a vaccine made using familiar technology, and dispensed in ways that people are familiar with -- in pediatricians' offices, at pharmacies, in grocery stores and at clinics.  ""You have a playbook for influenza,"" Shah said. ""This is not the same."" Any coronavirus vaccines will involve new technology and a whole new process for distribution, administration and then for payment. And while anyone can walk into, say, a pharmacy, get a flu shot and leave without ever thinking about it again, coronavirus vaccines will involve a whole lot more trouble and paperwork. People will probably need at least two doses about a month apart. Someone will have to track and follow up on that. ""We have to be able to see who has been vaccinated and who has not been,"" Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, told a public hearing about vaccine distribution organized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Paperwork and red tape ""To have two doses means that you provide the initial dose and we will need to bring the person back for a second dose a month later,"" Dr. Jinlene Chan, acting deputy secretary of public health for the state of Maryland, told CNN. And it's very likely that vaccines made by several different companies will be in use by next year. ""We have to make sure that we give the person the same vaccine for their second dose that they got for their first dose,"" Chan said. No vaccination program can start until there are plans in place to manage this. Plus, the coronavirus vaccine or vaccines will still be experimental, so every person who gets one will need to be tracked to make sure there are no adverse reactions. There is no plan yet for any of this. ""We have gotten very little information on how this is going to roll out,"" said Harris County's Shah. ""That makes it even more difficult to plan.""  One big potential stumbling block is what's known as the cold chain. The two vaccines furthest along in development both must be kept frozen. Moderna's vaccine must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius), while Pfizer's must be kept at -94 F (-70 C). While -4 isn't much colder than the optimal home freezer's setting of 0 degrees F, -94 is more of a challenge. ""Throughout -- from every single point the vaccine has to traverse -- we have to maintain it at that temperature. Otherwise, there is a risk of some degradation and the vaccine possibly becoming less effective,"" Chan said. ""We need to make sure that there is some capability to store it appropriately until it is ready to use."" Otherwise, a thawed batch could mean hundreds or even thousands of people get a dud vaccine. This can be a challenge, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a vaccine expert at Emory University. ""We simply don't have freezers that can reach minus 70 degrees in most clinics,"" he told the National Academies meeting. To reach enough people, any mass vaccination effort will have to go beyond clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. ""You are going to have to get out to communities. You are going to have to get out to places of work,"" Del Rio said. That makes keeping the vaccines cold enough more of a challenge. Plescia said Pfizer has a plan to help keep its vaccine cold. ""Pfizer is going to have special boxes they ship the vaccines in, packed with dry ice,"" he said. ""Once you get the box, it'll keep the stuff at negative 80 degrees for 10 days."" But it's not clear, Plescia said, if the boxes could be opened and a few doses of vaccine taken out safely. ""Even if these boxes work very well, it is still going to add a whole level of challenge,"" he said. Taking the mass out of mass vaccinationPast mass vaccination efforts have been just that -- mass. But coronavirus is a respiratory disease, and the last thing anyone should be doing is lining people up or packing them into, say, school gyms to get vaccinated, Chan noted. ""With mass vaccination clinics, it involves bringing large groups of people into a site and vaccinating as many people as possible,"" Chan said. ""How do we do that in a way that reduces the risk of transmitting the very disease that we trying to vaccinate against?""  Illinois' Ezike said some of the experience with test sites may help. ""We had these strike teams,"" she said. ""We have been able to convert a lot of different sites into sites where people can drive up. Can you do a vaccination through the [car] window?"" she asked.  But to accommodate that, cities and states will have to get busy soon. ""We are going to need additional providers,"" she told the NASEM meeting. ""We need mass vaccination clinics and sites. So we really want to recruit lots and lots of essential partners,"" she added -- especially for the communities that are hardest hit by the pandemic, including meat-packing facilities and remote rural areas. That means changes in policies and legislation -- another potentially time-consuming process. Medical practice is legislated by states, not by the federal government. ""We know that we'll need some expanded scope of practice for different professional groups,"" she said. For instance, states may want to enable dentists, dental hygienists and even medical school students and veterinarians to vaccinate people. And that requires some other levels of legislation so that providers can get paid for their time. Changes to health insurance laws may be necessary, including billing codes that provide for a system under which people get vaccinated for no charge. Because rollout will not be immediate, people will be vaccinated in groups. The National Academies is considering this, as is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). They, along with private advocacy groups, have already released their own draft blueprints that in general put health care workers, first responders and the most vulnerable at the front of the line. But that's another layer of management for governments to take on. Many states have old and unwieldy systems for managing all of this, and Ezike said the needed upgrades may take time. Immunity takes time Adding to the timeline is simple biology. The Pfizer and Modern vaccines, at least, will have to be given in two doses, a month apart. After that, it takes about two weeks for immunity to build. That makes for six weeks from the time someone first gets vaccinated to when they can feel safe from infection.  On top of all of this, many Americans are fearful of vaccines -- especially a new one and especially a new vaccine rolled out in a time of intense politicization of the process. ""There's general vaccination mistrust and then there's government mistrust,"" Ezike noted. The current atmosphere over mask use has not helped, added Harris County's Shah. ""We have made it a political fight,"" he said. ""When you make it political in nature, not driven by health and medical considerations, ultimately people will take sides."" Unless a majority of the population gets vaccinated, the virus will continue its spread. Most estimates suggest that 60% to 70% of the population must be immune to provide enough herd immunity to interrupt the spread of the virus. Polls indicate that only about half of Americans feel confident right now about being vaccinated.  And if vaccines are less than fully effective, that may mean even more of the population needs to be vaccinated to have an effect on spread. Then there are the unknowns. ""Testing has not been seamless at all. There are going to be some glitches,"" Plescia said. ""I think there is a good chance there is going to be a vaccine that works and gets us out of this, but it is hard to believe that it is going to go really smoothly, given all the things that could happen."" Shah is ready for unpleasant surprises. ""This is a super slick virus that has broken every rule in the book,"" he said.",2
119," (CNN)Many of us hope to escape who we were in high school -- particularly if you were last in line to be picked in gym class -- but a growing body of research suggests that how popular you are in adolescence has a link with psychological and physical health decades later. Thirteen-year-olds who weren't very popular with their peers growing up, a new study released Tuesday has found, seem to have a heightened risk of developing circulatory system disease in later life. This includes higher risk for conditions such as narrowed and hardened arteries and abnormal heartbeat that affect the normal functioning of the heart and blood vessels. ""Although not many realize it, peer status is one of the strongest predictors of later psychological and health outcomes, even decades later, said Mitch Prinstein, the John Van Seters distinguished professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina. ""Several early studies revealed that our likeability among peers in grade school predicts life outcomes more strongly than does IQ, parental income, school grades, and pre-existing physical illness,"" Prinstein, who wasn't involved with the research, said. Prinstein, and the authors of the study, said that it's important to note that peer status is a specific form of popularity -- likeability rather than being the cool kid.  ""Many would perhaps think of high-status kids as those who were highly visible and influential -- hanging out in the smoking area during breaks and partying during the weekends. That is another type of popularity, which is sometimes referred to as perceived popularity,"" said Ylva Almquist, an associate professor and senior lecturer at the department of public health sciences at Stockholm University and an author of the study, which published in the journal BMJ Open. ""Peer status is rather an indicator of likability, and the degree to which a child is accepted and respected by their peers.""Chronic health problems are usually explained by genetic factors or actions like smoking, drinking or an unhealthy diet, but research has suggested that high-quality relationships are a key indicator of mortality. Observational studyIn this study from Sweden, the researchers used data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, which includes everyone born in 1953 and residing in Stockholm, the Swedish capital, in 1963.The health of 5,410 men and 5,990 women was tracked into their 60s. At age 13, they had been asked who among their classmates they preferred to work with. They used the results to determine ""peer group status,"" which they divided into four categories: zero nominations, which they termed ""marginalized""; one (""low status""); two or three (""medium status""); and four or more (""high status""). Thirty-three percent of the boys enjoyed high peer group status at the age of 13, slightly more than girls (28.5%), the researchers found. Some 16% of the girls were classed as ""marginalized,"" compared to 12% of boys.  Circulatory disease was more common among the men than it was among the women, but the children classed as ""marginalized"" at age 13 had a 33% to 34% higher risk of circulatory disease in adulthood in both sexes, the study found. In their analysis, the researchers said they accounted for factors such as number and position of siblings, parental education and mental health, socioeconomic conditions, and school factors, such as intellect, academic performance and any criminal behavior.But as an observational study, it can only show a link, and Almquist said there could be many explanations for the association. ""A common dilemma in this kind of research is that we have the information we need to establish associations between conditions in childhood and health outcomes in adulthood, but we know quite little about whatever is happening in between,"" Almquist said.Potential for chronic inflammation due to stressKatherine Ehrlich, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Georgia, who wasn't involved in the research, said one explanation could be chronic inflammation linked to stressful experiences of relationships, both in adolescence and in adulthood. ""It is plausible that stressful social experiences (like being socially isolated) could lead to persistent unresolved inflammation, and if these levels are sustained over time, that could increase one's risk for plaques in the arteries, heart attacks, and other cardiovascular problems,"" said Ehrlich, who wasn't involved in the research.""It seems likely that health behaviors also play a role in the progression from low peer status to circulatory diseases decades later. Individuals who are socially isolated may be more likely to have unhealthy diets, engage in excessive drinking, and lead sedentary lifestyles, all of which could also increase one's risk for cardiovascular problems.""There is also an evolutionary logic, according to Prinstein, who is also the author of ""Popularity: Finding Happiness and Success in a World That Cares Too Much About the Wrong Kinds of Relationships.""""Our species is uniquely and remarkably attuned to our social position because many years ago we relied on each other for safety,"" he said.""Research now reveals that social rejection activates the same regions of the brain that are known to respond to physical pain, and also expresses dormant DNA to prepare our bodies for imminent injury. Unfortunately, this response is no longer necessary, so the expression of these genes leaves us more vulnerable to viral infections and more likely to suffer from inflammation-related illnesses,"" Prinstein said. He added that it was also possible that those higher in peer status are more likely to be afforded opportunities for learning and access to more resources -- including ones that could promote their health. ""We spend so much time, energy, and funding attending to factors we think can improve children's chances at a happy and successful life, but we have neglected the one factor that is perhaps most important of all: our children's ability to get along well with others and be perceived as likeable,"" he said.For parents worried about their kids' social life, Almquist stressed that problematic experiences with peers do not automatically lead to health problems and having caring and supportive parents was a ""protective factor.""Ehrlich agreed that strong ties between parents and teens could act as a buffer against problematic peer relationships. ""It is understandable to see these findings and worry about the long-term consequences for teens who might be more socially isolated. ""Additionally, many adolescents struggle at one point or another with their peer relationships -- finding it difficult to fit in or 'find their people,'"" she said. ""The advice I would give to families is: keep trying. Join new clubs, try to meet people online, put yourself out there -- you never know who could turn out to be a lifelong friend.""",2
120," (CNN)At first, Cameron Lynch thought she would need prepared questions for the group to discuss in their first Zoom call. On the list of proposed topics: ""Have you had a hard time with friends in the pandemic?"", ""Are you planning to go back to school in the fall?"" and ""How have you been coping on a day-to-day basis?""But Lynch quickly realized that the group of immunocompromised college students didn't need questions to guide them. They just wanted to talk about their shared feeling of isolation during the pandemic. They bonded over the fact that people assume that all teens are healthy. They questioned whether their schools were taking the right measures to help those who are more at-risk. They vented about their friends not understanding their inability to leave the house without fear of contracting Covid.It's a virtual support group for immunocompromised students -- but its members don't call it that. They prefer the name ""Chronic and Iconic."" It all started with a social media post. Lynch, who has Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and a form of muscular dystrophy, opened up in a heartfelt letter to her friends and followers. ""While I have been preparing my body to fight the virus by running so my lung capacity can be better, eating healthy so that my body has enough nutrients to fight, and attempting to manage my disease (which is difficult with teenage hormones), it seems that everyone else has stopped caring,"" Lynch, 19, wrote in the letter, which she shared with CNN. ""My reality is different. My reality is isolating.""Her reality means she can't hang out with other college students who she said she sees on her social media feed ""flood to the beaches to drink their White Claws."" Instead, it means she sits alone in her bed ""afraid that no one cares.""Much to Lynch's surprise, the post resonated beyond her own social network. What started in July as a five-person Zoom hangout has turned into a 50-plus person group -- with students from across the US -- who have an ongoing GroupMe text messaging chain and frequent video calls.As US colleges and universities return -- either in-person, online only or both in what's called the ""hybrid model"" -- immunocompromised students are struggling to figure out how to navigate school during a pandemic. If their classes aren't offered online, some are forced to rearrange their schedules or risk falling behind. If they don't feel safe going to campus, some have to take a leave of absence. And throughout it all, some say the feeling of isolation has become overwhelming. ""I think one thing that the media and schools don't seem to understand is how these policies are impacting the mental health of their students,"" Lynch told CNN. ""By saying that in-person learning is essential, that's basically saying the community can function without us, and is better off when we're not there.""Covid puts life on hold for high-risk students In her letter, Lynch emphasized that her new normal means limiting time outside, even though she's sick of watching shows on Netflix. Unlike her peers, who can cautiously partake in activities, she feels she has to keep her life on hold until Covid is no longer a threat.And she's not alone. People with underlying medical conditions are more likely to become seriously ill if they get Covid-19. Some of them are young and most of them may not look sick at all. Millions of them are living with a compromised immune system.""People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,"" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes on its website. ""They may also remain infectious for a longer period of time than others with COVID-19.""Aside from worrying about getting infected, many of these immunocompromised students said they feel anxious about people -- specifically their peers -- disobeying health and safety guidelines.To date, there are more than 40,000 cases of Covid-19 among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- and is likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days.With social life trickling back to life on campuses, coronavirus outbreaks have hit places where students congregate, like fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning. While most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities.""With the pandemic, we don't have same sense of immortality as other people,"" Lynch said. ""This is very real for us. If we get a cold, we're in hospital for four days. We have to take it more seriously. If there aren't systems in place we have to make them.""They found comfort in a virtual communitySamantha Price, who has Type 1 diabetes, was among the first to respond to Lynch's letter.Price and Lynch met doing community theater in Richmond, Virginia, when they were 10 and nine years old, respectively. They bonded after realizing they both have diabetes. Over the years, they lost touch. But Price saw Lynch's post and reached out.Together, the two created the support group, which now includes people with a range of disabilities. ""We always say, 'Can you explain what that is please?' when people say what their disability is,"" Lynch said. ""We learn what everyone's going through, and how we can better support each other.""Price, a junior at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said it's been comforting to connect with people who understand how she's been feeling.""We're not normally surrounded by people who can relate to us,"" Price told CNN. ""It (the group) helps us have our feelings validated. If I'm super depressed or down in the dumps one day because my friends are going out and posting about it ... complaining isn't going to do anything,"" the 20-year-old said. ""But if I'm able to go to this group and say, 'this happened' 15 people like it or respond and say, 'I totally understand, that happened to me.'""Kaitlin Ahern, a 20-year-old student at Lafayette College, saw Lynch's social media post circulating online and reached out, eventually joining the group.""At this time it's very easy to feel ostracized and alone,"" said Ahern, who said she is immunocompromised because of a medication she takes. ""Because everyone's kind of paying attention to older people because they are immunocompromised, and younger people kind of expect all young people to be able to reckless and go out and party and everything."" Ahern's college is mostly remote for the semester, but she lives near other schools and sees students everywhere. ""I can't see my friends because they are all partying, they aren't willing to give up partying just to wear a mask and social distance (and) see me,"" she said. ""There's very little contact outside of my family. It's very lonely not interacting with anyone.""The virtual group has been ""amazing,"" especially as she struggled to connect to her existing social circle during the pandemic, she said.It's not surprising that the pandemic has affected the mental health of many nationwide, including young people. The National Center for Health Statistics and the US Census Bureau estimate that more than a third of Americans have experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety since spring.A recent CDC survey found that almost 41% of respondents are struggling with mental health issues stemming from the pandemic -- both related to the pandemic itself and the measures used to contain it, including physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.""A lot of students in the group text us, like 'Today was a terrible day, I'm so frustrated,'"" Lynch said. ""We're kind of like a help line in a sense. We're all at home so people respond very quickly.""Now, the group has gone beyond just sharing their problems.""People will talk about their highlight of the week, what quarantine crafts they've started,"" Price said. ""Some people will tell us about their personal lives. We've actually gotten to know these people really well.""Students ask peers to 'stay safely away'Aleah Colón-Alfonso, who has small fiber neuropathy, Lyme disease and accompanying secondary illnesses, said she felt the need to do something after noticing the lack of social distancing and facial coverings in Sarasota, Florida.Though the junior at the New College of Florida isn't part of the virtual support group, she has found a different way to help people who are in similar situations. In July, she officially launched a business called Stay Safely Away, which sells wearable merchandise that lets people display their immunocompromised status to urge others around them to ""stay safely away.""""Communicating behind masks and from a distance is difficult, so my idea and all my products attempt to serve as an unspoken and polite assertion,"" she told CNN.The company now sells more than 150 products, including beach towels, face masks, backpacks, school supplies, swimwear and stickers. All merchandise includes some sort of catchy yet informative message, like: ""I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised"" and ""science is real.""""'I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised' was a direct quote of what I wanted to say to every person I socially distanced myself from,"" she said. ""The phrase is essentially a shortened version of 'I really don't want to be rude -- but I also really don't want to end up on a ventilator!'"" Big plans beyond fallIn recent interviews with CNN, three developmental psychologists said they believe the majority of students are taking the pandemic seriously and acting accordingly. Viral videos of maskless parties and packed bars account for hundreds out of the nearly 20 million college students in the US, they said.But for at-risk students, the fear is still there -- and some must decide whether they feel safe enough to return to campus. ""The first feeling I had about universities and schools reopening was fear,"" Colón-Alfonso said. ""Fear of lives lost, fear of the academic and social impact, and fear of how to accurately make decisions in a time where everything seems uncertain and ever changing. I also felt a distinct trepidation towards institutions who need student tuition if they want to remain afloat.""Colón-Alfonso said her school has been very ""accommodating,"" and she feels safe returning to in-person learning. However, she added, ""I know that my experience is an exception to the rule. Seeing parties on the news, receiving texts from family and friends in college with stories of the danger they see every day is unsettling.""Many at-risk students remain wary of the risks. Lynch, who is in the UK with her family, and Price, who is in Virginia with her parents, said they have barely left their homes. But the time in quarantine has also given them a renewed sense of purpose -- and the two said they have big plans. Eventually, Lynch said, she and Price want to create a national organization for disabled students, with branches at universities and colleges.""There's college diabetes network which we're both apart of,"" Lynch said, ""but this would be for more disabilities -- physical, learning and invisible disabilities.""The two also hope to create a conference when it's safe to meet in person.""My goal is getting people to even acknowledge that there are young disabled people,"" Lynch said. ""It's really important.""For now, though, they continue to focus on building their community virtually -- and staying healthy while studying remotely.""We have an understanding that things suck right now,"" Price said. ""But (staying home) is what we have to do. It's going to be better for us in long run.""",2
121," (CNN)A mother's depression and anxiety from conception through the first year of the baby's life is associated with negative developmental outcomes through adolescence, according to a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.That could affect a lot of women: About 15% to 23% of women worldwide experience anxiety during pregnancy, while 15% deal with anxiety after childbirth. Depression through pregnancy is estimated to affect 10% of women, and 15% face postpartum depression. The burden is greater for women who are experiencing poverty or are teen parents, according to Postpartum Support International. For the baby, the perinatal stage — which is defined as the time from conception through pregnancy (antenatal), birth and the first year of the baby's life (postnatal) — is ""a time of unprecedented growth and sensitivity,"" the study said. That's when exposures and early life experiences may modify development starting from when he or she is in the womb to that critical first year as a growing child and onward. A mother experiencing depression and anxiety before and after birth was moderately linked with her child's deficits in language and cognitive and motor development in infancy. All of these children were more likely to exhibit behaviors that either internalized negative feelings or targeted them toward others. These kids experienced and reacted with more negative emotions and were temperamentally difficult through adolescence as well. ""In light of the pandemic, these are particularly concerning results,"" said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University, who wasn't involved in the study. ""Since risk factors for perinatal depression include life stress and lack of social support, pregnant and postpartum women may be particularly vulnerable right now.""These data that suggest that this poses risks not just for the mother, but also for her child, not just now but into adolescence, is a stark reminder that the indirect effects of Covid-19 may be long-lasting,"" Jamieson added. Researchers have conducted reviews of studies on the relationship between a woman's mental health during this time and her child's development — but they hadn't previously evaluated the long-term effects of depression and anxiety at different stages of motherhood on a range of developmental functions from infancy through adolescence, the study said. The authors of the current study analyzed the association of perinatal depression and anxiety with social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor and adaptive behavior development in their offspring from infancy up to age 18. They also examined whether the timing of depression and anxiety, type of mental illness and offspring age affected the findings. Mental health before and after birthParticipants included 195,751 otherwise healthy mother-child pairs from 191 studies based in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Norway. These women had either reported their symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or had diagnoses, while later information about their children's development was also self-reported. Depression and anxiety in the perinatal period had small-to-moderate associations with deficits in social-emotional behavior development through adolescence, such as peer problems, a lack of prosocial behaviors and attachment and emotional dysregulation. How maternal mental health might influence a child's growth How a mother's mental health might influence her offspring's development could hinge on what happens to the baby while in the womb and interactions after birth. Anxiety and depression during pregnancy could expose the fetus to increased concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, leading to changes in brain function and reducing the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients, the study said. The neurocognitive changes that prepare mothers to be able to sensitively respond to their infants could also be hampered by experiencing depression and anxiety during pregnancy, the study said. A mentally taxed mother may be less able to quickly, carefully and thoughtfully respond to her baby's cues — potentially reducing the chances of attachment between a mother and her baby.""During the first year of life, infants are unable to sooth themselves when they become upset — they rely on sensitive caregivers to respond when they are distressed,"" said Dr. Alison Stuebe, a professor of maternal and child health at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, who wasn't involved in the study.""With support from these caregivers, infants gradually learn how to cope with fear and frustration,"" Stuebe, also a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the UNC School of Medicine, added.The authors lacked details about individual, family and social factors that could have affected the mothers' mental health and their children's development, said the study's senior author Delyse Hutchinson, an associate professor in the school of psychology at the Centre for Early Social and Emotional Development at Deakin University in Australia. Additional studies are necessary, Jamieson said, but ""the large numbers of studies in this systematic review begin to paint a fairly consistent pattern."" 'When parents struggle, kids struggle'For mothers to recover from birth and transition to their role as parents, and for growing families to thrive, they need support, Stuebe said. ""But in the United States, 23% of mothers are back at work within 10 days postpartum,"" Stuebe added. ""We are (the) only industrialized country without paid parental leave. Women lose pregnancy Medicaid coverage at 60 days after birth, losing access to psychotherapy and medical treatment for depression and anxiety."" If parents lack access to treatment because they're uninsured, can't take time off from work or face some other barrier, Stuebe continued, ""it's likely that their children will be exposed to food and housing insecurity, poorly funded schools, lack of safe spaces to play and other stressors.""When parents struggle, kids struggle."" Maintaining well-being through new chaptersSince families now ""have to balance the urgent need for hands-on help with deciding who can be part of their 'bubble' in the first weeks after birth,"" the pandemic has made building a village more challenging, Stuebe said. Some solutions can be found at New Mom Health, a resource for postpartum women. Expecting and new mothers concerned about their mood should seek help from their physician and/or psychologist early, Hutchinson said. ""Perinatal difficulties are often overlooked,"" Hutchinson said, ""and many women do not seek help because they think it is expected that mothers feel down, tired or worried or because they are concerned about the stigma related to mental health."" Staying connected with supportive family, friends and other mothers is also important, Hutchinson said — as is doing activities that bring you joy and regularly practicing self-care, ""whether it involves going for a walk or other exercise, reading a book, speaking to a friend, relaxation or simply catching up on some sleep."" While these tools alone may not prevent depression and anxiety, they can help mothers navigate challenges. If mothers are concerned that their children have any of the developmental deficits the study highlighted, they should talk with their pediatrician, Hutchinson said. ""If difficulties are recognised and help is sought,"" Hutchinson said via email, ""this risk may be reduced, potentially leading to improved health and wellbeing outcomes for both mother and child.""

122," (CNN)Like many moms, Sofia Axelrod found the lack of sleep really hard after giving birth. But unlike many moms, she refused to accept that the exhaustion was inevitable. ""Sleep deprivation is so detrimental,"" said sleep consultant Axelrod, who is a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York. ""I didn't just want to suck it up and think, yeah my life for now on is going to be permanently damaged.""The mother of two was inspired to dig into the research, looking for evidence-based tactics to get young children and their parents to sleep through the night. The results of her search can be found in her new book, ""How Babies Sleep: The Gentle, Science-Based Method to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night.""Axelrod learned that parents' brains -- mostly moms -- are wired to care for a young child. Nighttime noises, tame or savage, will jolt many of us awake. Even when the baby is capable of self-soothing. Even when we are so, so tired.But if we let our instinct to care for our young children reign supreme, and get no sleep as a result, nobody wins. ""If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy,"" the old saying goes; and sleep-deprived mamas are not happy.""I wanted to be happy, and I need sleep to make me happy,"" Axelrod said. ""So I said, how do I make it happen?""Axelrod spoke to CNN about how to maximize everyone's sleep, from the baby years on. She also had a few thoughts about which pandemic habits might be getting in the way of a good night's sleep, and which ones, surprisingly, are not.This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.CNN: Humans instinctively respond to light and get sleep cues from natural and artificial light. What should parents use for light to signal ""sleepy time"" to their kids?Sofia Axelrod: The light bulb went off in my head, pardon the pun -- it's intended -- when I was working in the lab with fruit flies. When we want to test their sleep without waking them up, we use a red flashlight. Every other type of light wakes them up.I was pregnant, and I realized that the same is true for humans. We are largely insensitive to red light. So I bought a red light bulb (Ed. note: Not all red light bulbs are actual red light, so shop carefully) and started using it during nighttime feeds when my baby was born, and it worked. The baby wouldn't get the signal from the red light that it's time to wake up.CNN: How does light signal to the brain that it's time to sleep or time to wake up? Axelrod: We have these special cells in the back of our eyes that have special light receptors. So whenever you're exposed to light, in the morning or the evening, they signal to your body that it's time to be awake. They reset your body clock. You can use light to help train your body that this is bedtime, and this is morning time.CNN: Can introducing red light and limiting overall light exposure help older kids fall asleep more quickly at night?Axelrod: Yes. We actually have a red light in our living room that we put on an hour before bedtime.Subscribe to CNN's Sleep, But Better Newsletter: Want the best sleep of your life? Sign up for our newsletter series for helpful hints to achieve better sleep.CNN: Can dimming lights in the evening help get us to sleep?Axelrod: Yes, though it's really important to be consistent with timing. We need to work with our inner clock. Also, turn the red light on or dim the lights an hour before bedtime. This is how long it takes for the sleep hormone that is dependent on light to be released.CNN: Though no matter how careful we are with lights, babies will still cry in their cribs. What's your take on sleep training?Axelrod: Honestly, I regret calling it ""sleep training"" in the book because those two words have such a negative connotation. That said, there are longitudinal studies showing that allowing your child to cry a little and learn to self-soothe has no detrimental effects. I recommend a middle ground. Suppress your mom guilt and let them cry for 90 seconds before you go in. The research is crystal clear -- even just 90 seconds will teach them to fall asleep. People don't realize this, but babies are not born knowing how to fall asleep. It's our job to teach them.CNN: What do you think about co-sleeping?Axelrod: This is a very personal decision. But the research has shown that if you are in the same bed as your child, it's much harder to create that short delay between when the baby wakes up and the parent soothes the baby, and the delay is important for learning how to self-soothe. If a parent thinks they need that closeness, then go for it. But the research does show that kids who co-sleep take longer to learn to sleep through the night. CNN: What about naps? Last year my son took a mandtatory nap at his preschool, and then was staying up past 10 p.m. every night. Should we never wake a sleeping child?Axelrod: I had that exact experience at my child's day care. I tried my best to use my credentials to get them to change their policy so naps weren't required, but it didn't work, and I ended up having my nanny go early to pick up my daughter so she wouldn't nap there. It was either that or let her sleep there and have her go to sleep at midnight.Science is very clear on this point: Daytime naps control toddler sleep. Control! Kids only need so much sleep in a day. If your kid isn't going to bed at night, cut that nap. Either make it shorter or cut it altogether.CNN: There seems to be a critical mass of people who believe that it's better for kids to go to sleep early. But some kids are night owls. Are they OK? Axelrod: This is so politicized -- that somehow people who go to bed late and wake up late are still considered lazy. But there is a genetic basis for circadian rhythms. One out of 100 people have a mutation in their clock genes that alter their day length, and as a result they go to sleep later. It's not detrimental, and nothing is wrong as long as they are getting enough overall sleep.CNN: Many families are a bit off their sleep schedules during the pandemic and going to bed later. So they'll be fine? Axelrod: It doesn't matter if you go to bed later. What does matter is day-to-day variation. I don't recommend doing something different over the weekend than during the week or when you are on vacation. Your circadian clock responds to time cues, and it helps regulate everything, from when you go to sleep to when you are ready for lunch. You want to keep this regular.CNN: What about television at night? I've heard that you need to stay far away from all things backlit in the evening. But sometimes 30 minutes of TV helps us settle down.Axelrod: Screens can be fine at night. Just try to dim it as much as possible, and generally try to avoid them an hour before bedtime. Though people do have different sensitivity to light. Some of us might be fine watching them right before bed without any decrease of our melatonin production or impact on our sleep overall.CNN: Any solutions for Covid anxiety-related nightmares or wake-ups in our kids?Axelrod: It's important to remember that our kids are sensitive to what is going on, and they may not know it or even show it. It depends on the age, but overall it's important to shield our kids from our anxieties and the news to some degree so they can sleep.There is a strong correlation between not getting enough sleep and depression, and so the sleep deprivation can end up making them feel even worse if it continues. Parents need to try to provide the comfort their kids need, so the kids' anxieties don't take over and keep everyone from sleeping well.",2
123," (CNN)An influential model is predicting a catastrophic winter with a significant rise in coronavirus deaths.A possible scenario sees 415,090 Covid-19 deaths by January, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington says in its latest forecast. The worst-case scenario is 600,000 deaths by January 1.""When we look ahead into the winter with seasonality kicking in, people becoming clearly less vigilant, you know mask use is down, mobility is up in the nation, you put all those together and we look like we're going to have a very deadly December ahead of us in terms of toll of coronavirus,""  IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper.The IHME model is essentially predicting the number of deaths will double in the next four months. As of Friday, nearly 6.4 million infections have been recorded in the US and more than 192,000 Americans have died,  according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Despite the dire prediction, President Donald Trump says the US has done ""really well"" in fighting the virus, according to a Thursday video on the White House official Facebook page. ""I really do believe we're rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there, but not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump said. Speaking with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not agree with the President's statements.""We're plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day, and the deaths of around 1,000,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He said test positivity is increasing in some regions of the country and people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather.""That's not good for a respiratory-borne virus,"" he said. ""You don't want to start off already with a baseline that's so high.""Fauci's disagreement with that comment is another example of a top scientist and a member of the White House coronavirus task force publicly disputing the President's claims about the virus. ""We're in a very politically-charged atmosphere now and whenever you're trying to get people all together singing from the same tune and doing the same things as a society, unified against this common enemy -- this virus -- it's very difficult to do that when you have such a charged atmosphere that we have right now,"" Fauci told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""And that really is truly unfortunate."" Fauci warned that the country needs to get the levels down lower ""so that when you go into a more precarious situation, like the fall and the winter, you won't have a situation where you really are at a disadvantage right from the very beginning.""US may not return to normal until 2021, Fauci saysThe US might not return to pre-coronavirus life until the end of next year, Fauci said, but he is cautiously optimistic the US will have a vaccine by the end of this year. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual and I think it's going to take several months before we get to the point where we can really feel something that approximates how it was normally before Covid-19,"" he said.There's also the issue of how many doses of the vaccine will be available and how long it takes to distribute the vaccine. ""It's going to take several months to get the country safe and vaccinated,"" Fauci said. Nearly 30 US states are reporting downward trends in Covid-19 cases, but the pandemic will likely worsen again, Fauci said.""We need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it's not going to be easy,"" Fauci said.Experts -- including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director -- have warned the months ahead will be challenging. The US continues to see about 36,000 new cases each day -- which is better than  August but still too high, Fauci said. ""I keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I'd like,"" he said.As the weather gets colder, Americans will move indoors more, where the virus spreads more easily. The coming flu season will complicate diagnoses. The strains on the healthcare system will make for one of the ""most difficult times that we experienced in American public health,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has said. Where we stand nowThe actual number of infections could be far greater. Many may have had Covid-19 without knowing, as the CDC projects about 40% of people who are infected don't show any symptoms.Others could have been sick but never got tested. A new study says the US greatly undercounted Covid-19 cases at the start of the pandemic -- missing 90% of them -- mostly due to a lack in testing. Across the US, 28 states are reporting downward trends -- including Florida and California -- compared to the previous week, and 14 are steady.Experts worry a surge could come weeks after Labor Day celebrations, like cases soared after the Fourth of July. An ensemble forecast from the CDC now projects that between 205,000 and 217,000 people in the US will die by October 3.Medical experts also worry about the upcoming flu season. Fauci told CNN Friday the CDC recommended people getting their flu vaccines by October 31. ""What we're hoping for -- and I hope this happens -- is that a combination of people getting vaccinated against the flu and the fact that the very public health measures that they implement to avoid coronavirus will actually help them avoid influenza,"" Fauci said. Fauci also recommended people ""hunker down"" for the fall and winter, but he says that does not mean shutting down the country again. ""We don't need to shut down, we can do this if we pull together and abide by relatively simple and understandable public health measures,"" Fauci said, adding that the measures include social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding crowds. Non-symptomatic children can transmit virus, data showEven children with mild or no symptoms can transmit Covid-19, according to contact tracing data from three Utah child care facilities released Friday. Researchers said 12 children got Covid-19 in a child care location and transmitted it to at least 12 people outside, including household members. They analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care centers in Salt Lake County from this April to July. They found at least two children who had no symptoms not only had caught the virus but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One 8-month-old child spread the virus to both parents. The researchers say that two of the facility outbreaks began with staff members who had household contacts with the virus.Overall, children accounted for 13 of the 31 confirmed Covid-19 case linked to the facility, and all of the children had mild or no symptoms.Infected college students shouldn't be sent homeColleges across the country have made face masks a requirement hoping to keep Covid-19 cases down. But just weeks into the first semester, campuses from all 50 states have reported infections. The University of Texas at Austin announced this week three confirmed clusters on campus which collectively account for about 100 cases. San Diego State University confirmed almost 400 infections among students, after announcing a halt on in-person instruction.And more than 1,300 Arizona State University students have tested positive since August 1. Colleges and universities should try to isolate infected students instead of sending them home, Fauci has said. ""You send them back to their community, you will in essence be reseeding with individuals who are capable of transmitting infection, many communities throughout the country,"" he said earlier this week. ""So it's much, much better to have the capability to put them in a place where they could comfortably recover.""",2
124," (CNN)When the pandemic hit, couples found themselves worrying about getting sick, losing income, teaching their children at home while working full time (or worrying full time about sending them to school). It hardly makes a perfect recipe for sex. The stress has been too much for one Texas couple in their mid-40s with two children, according to one woman who did not want to be named due to the sensitive nature of the story, given her high-profile job in Austin. ""I stopped exercising because I was too scared of the plague ravaging society,"" she said.""While scared and doing nothing, I threw my back out and couldn't move for two weeks,"" said the woman, who now works her informational technology job from home alongside her husband.Then her husband had a non-Covid health issue that ""doused any embers that may have survived all of our lockdown trauma.""Covid-19 has invaded nearly every aspect of our lives. So, it's no surprise it's infiltrated our bedrooms, too — for better or worse. Many people are reporting challenges in their sex lives and relationships, according to early findings from the ongoing Sex and Relationships in the Time of Covid-19 study undertaken by Indiana University's Kinsey Institute, which researches issues related to gender, sexuality and reproduction.What the sex surveys sayThe results are a mixed bag so far, said Justin Lehmiller, a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and the author of ""Tell Me What You Want,"" a book about the science of sexual desire.""Some people reported their sex lives and romantic lives had improved and were reporting their relationships were better and stronger than ever,"" he said. ""But a larger number (of respondents) reported challenges in their sex lives and relationships.""The study kicked off mid-March, and researchers initially heard back from roughly 2,000 respondents -- 75% of whom were Americans and 25% were from other countries -- between the ages of 18 and 81 in varied relationships. Almost 53% of the participants identified as heterosexual, almost 20% as bisexual and the rest as: queer, pansexual, gay/lesbian or other. About 44% of participants reported a decline in the quality of their sex lives, with 30% reporting a decline in their romantic lives, according to early findings from the longitudinal study, which is in its sixth wave and will continue for several more months.Some 14% said their sex lives had improved, he said, and 23% reported their relationship was in a better place.And summer, Lehmiller said, brought no salvation. When people are going on vacation and have more free time, there's usually more sexual activity. But the most recent wave of data collection from this summer indicated our sex lives have not yet rebounded to the levels of past summers. ""This summer really seems to be the exception to that peak,"" he said. More stress equals less sexDeclining quality of one's sex life often correlates with higher levels of stress, according to Lehmiller. ""We know that stress comes from a lot of different sources, it's complex and multi-factorial,"" he said. ""The more stressed people reported feeling, the less desire for sex.""That's true even when business is good. For Marcus Anwar, 31, working long hours in Toronto running OhMy — the classified advertising website he founded in 2017 — appears to be taking a toll on his sex life with his fiancee. With everything moving online, OhMy's revenue has tripled its revenue since the pandemic began, he said, but that has meant less free time for the couple.""There are days I am working 14 to 16 hours. Having the weekend off is a thing of the past,"" Anwar said.  ""When I'm done working, I try to spend quality time with Tiffany. But unfortunately, there are constant calls and emails that I have to answer, making it very difficult to separate work from personal life.""""Even though we've been together for so many years, it just hasn't felt like it used to, when we both wanted to be having sex,"" said Tiffany, 29, who declined to give her last name for privacy reasons. ""(Back) when there weren't a million things we had to worry about or have to get done."" Talking about sex is difficultDiana Wiley, a Seattle-based certified sex therapist and licensed marriage and family therapist, told CNN that talking about sex can be very hard. ""Some people are so stressed they've just kind of folded up their tents about sex, they don't want to do it,"" said Wiley, whose book, ""Love in the Time of Corona,"" shares tips for reconnecting sexually and emotionally in troubling times. Wiley suggested a few ways for couples to try to get their sex lives back on track in pandemic times, including tips for full-body caressing exercises that begin with nonsexual touch to help release stress.Being more mindful in the bedroom and in general, she said, can also be beneficial.""Take control of your thoughts rather than let your mind send you into a tailspin,"" she said, ""It helps to name what's true right now, in this moment — my family and friends are healthy, for example."" And if you have to put sex on the calendar, do it. ""It's a myth for sex to be any good it needs to be spontaneous,"" she said. Some are having more intimate sexAccording to the Kinsey Institute's early findings, not everyone is folding up their tents, however.For Bob Curley of Rhode Island and his wife, who had recently gone back to grad school, the couple of over 30 years had adapted to her being away from home more often.""Initially, there was a lot of stress around the pandemic that didn't put us in an amorous mood,"" Curley told CNN. ""But once we got used to it, we really started enjoying having the extra time together.""Their communication improved in and out of the bedroom, he said. ""The sex may not have increased significantly in terms of frequency, but the intimacy definitely has,"" said Curley, adding that the couple took the opportunity to ""push some sexual boundaries together in a way we might not otherwise have found the time or energy to do.""The Kinsey study backs him up, with one in five people trying at least one new sexual activity since the pandemic began, said Lehmiller, including things like trying a new sexual position, sexting or sending nude photos and sharing or acting on sexual fantasies. ""This period in time has been a sexual revolution for many people,"" he said, adding that people who are trying new things were three times more likely than those who aren't to report improvements in their sex lives. Single life in pandemic timeFor single people considering new relationships during the pandemic, feelings of isolation are often compounded with health concerns about Covid-19, said Jenni Skyler, a certified sex therapist and director of The Intimacy Institute in Boulder, Colorado.""I see a lot of people taking this as an opportunity to connect online and cultivate emotional intimacy first before jumping to something physical,"" she said. Such was the case for 34-year-old San Diego resident Jackie Bryant, who pens a monthly newsletter about cannabis culture. Until recently, she said she had been perusing dating apps but not meeting anyone in person due to the health concerns of the pandemic. ""I've been much more choosy, talking to a number of people, trying to be open-minded, but not agreeing to see anybody unless it seemed really promising,"" Bryant said. ""There's this very real layer of death and sickness tied to human intimacy now.""  The pandemic made ""me drill down on what I was looking for even more,"" she said. ""Am I going risk my life for some chump? ... not anymore."" During a recent socially distanced second date that ended with an awkward but cute moment when saying goodbye, Bryant said, she and the man navigated their personal safety rules. ""I was like, 'For you I don't have rules,'"" she said. ""From opposite sides of my yard, we walked toward each other and kissed."" ""I've decided I can't put that part of my life on hold. I need sex, I want to be in a relationship and who knows how long this will last,""  Bryant said. ""You learn to navigate that within the confines of Covid.""And how people navigate the pandemic, it seems, may have the power to lead to a sunnier sexual outcome.""The overall emerging picture is that there are more struggles and challenges,"" Lehmiller said. ""But there's a sizable number of people who really seem to be thriving during this situation, too.""",2
125," (CNN)Cakes, cookies, pie. During a global pandemic or even more moderately stressful life circumstances, we often turn to comforting sugary and carb-rich indulgences that may help to calm us down.Now for the bad news. New recommendations that will inform soon-to-be-released US dietary guidelines reveal we should further limit the amount of sugar we consume. This guidance will come at a time when many of us may be looking to indulge our sweet tooth more than ever. No sugarcoating the new recommendationsFirst, some sugar basics: Not all sugars are created equal and need to be limited to the same degree. Natural sugars are present in nutritious foods like fruit and milk in the form of fructose and lactose. These foods deliver important nutrients — such as fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals — that play a role in a healthy diet. Added sugars are another story. They are sugars or sweeteners that are added to foods or beverages during processing or preparation. They contribute calories, without any essential nutrients.The average American gets about 13% of their total calories from added sugars, but new recommendations call for that average to be cut by about half, according to a recently issued report from the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee — a group of experts charged with providing science-based recommendations every five years. The 2020 committee recommended a limit of no more than 6% of calories coming from added sugars, with ranges from 3% at the lowest calorie levels and up to 8% at the highest calorie levels (which vary based on age, gender, activity level and body weight).  The committee also recommended that children younger than age 2 should avoid any foods and beverages with added sugars.How many treats do you get?That 6% limit translates to 30 grams of sugar in a 2,000 calorie daily diet — less sugar than what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. It's a limit that more closely reflects the American Heart Association's current recommendation, which was issued in 2009.  The heart association's recommendation translates to a limit of 6 teaspoons of sugar, or about 25 grams each day for women and children over 2 years of age; and about 9 teaspoons, or about 36 grams for men.                 There are 6 teaspoons or 25 grams of sugar in two and a half chocolate chip cookies, 16 ounces of fruit punch and about 1½ tablespoons of honey. There are 9 teaspoons, or about 36 grams of sugar in 11 ounces of cola, 2 servings of premium vanilla ice cream and about 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of honey.Why do you need to avoid added sugars? They increase the risk for cardiovascular disease in different ways. For one, excess calorie intake contributes to weight gain, thereby increasing risks for insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  High sugar intake is also associated with increased triglyceride levels that often accompany reduced HDL-cholesterol (high-density lipoproteins, better known as the good cholesterol) levels, thereby contributing to metabolic syndrome, also a risk for developing cardiovascular disease, explained Linda Van Horn, chief of the nutrition division at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine's department of preventive medicine.And since most adults need fewer calories with increasing age, their limited total calorie intake should come from nutrient-dense foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and fish, appropriate dairy foods, legumes and nuts, Van Horn said. ""To consume all of those recommended foods encompasses the vast majority of their calorie allowance leaving very few 'discretionary' or empty sugary calories without causing weight gain,"" Van Horn said. But though limiting added sugars to 6% of calories may be ideal from a nutrient-density perspective, that doesn't mean it will be easy to achieve.""While it's great if you can get added sugar intake to no more than 6% of calories, depending on your current diet, the (previous) recommendation of no more than 10% of calories may be a more realistic and achievable goal to aim for first,"" said Denver-based registered dietitian nutritionist Kelli McGrane, who works as a dietitian for Lose It! and TheHealthyToast.com.Again, here's the math: 6% of added sugars on a 2,000 calorie diet is 30 grams of sugar or 120 sugar calories.  Strategies for cutting backFive food categories — sweetened beverages, desserts and sweet snacks, coffee and tea (with their additions), candy and sugars, and breakfast cereals and bars — contribute 70% of the added sugars we consume in the United States, according to the dietary guidelines committee. These foods are often energy-dense with low amounts of key dietary nutrients. Here are some ways to reduce your intake.Train your taste buds to crave less sugar. Cut back gradually and include more protein and fiber-rich foods in your diet, which will help you crave less sugar.  Consume low-sugar or no-sugar-added versions of foods. Opt for whole-grain cereals with less than 6 grams of sugar per serving and unsweetened yogurts, McGrane said.You can sweeten these foods with natural, nutrient-rich sources of sugar like berries or diced fruit. If your kids love a sugary cereal, you can sprinkle it on top of a healthier, whole-grain cereal. Limit or avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks. That includes sodas, energy drinks and fruit punch. If you like sweet carbonated beverages, add a splash of cranberry or orange juice to seltzer or try flavored seltzers. You can also flavor your own waters with fruit slices for natural sweetness or try herbal fruit teas.Cut back on sugar in your coffee and tea. These sugar calories can quickly add up, especially if you drink more than one cup each day. If you are currently adding 2 teaspoons of sugar, cut back to one. This applies to coffee shops, too. ""If you're just starting to wean yourself off sweetened store-bought coffee drinks, ask for fewer pumps of syrup. As each pump contains approximately 5 grams of sugar, depending on the flavor, the sugar savings add up quickly,"" McGrane said.Enjoy fruit for dessert. Try cinnamon baked apples, berries or grilled peaches instead of cookies, cake, ice cream, pastries and other sweet treats. If you need something a bit more indulgent, swap your candy habit for a piece of good-quality dark chocolate. ""It'll still satisfy that sweet craving without as much sugar,"" McGrane said.Look out for stealth sugars. Added sugars are often present in foods that you might not think of as ""sweet,"" like sauces, breads, condiments and salad dressings. ""Pre-packaged sauces — like ketchup, BBQ sauce and tomato sauce — tend to be some of the biggest offenders of hidden added sugars in the diet,"" said Kristi King, senior pediatric dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital and a national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Check nutrition facts labels. This will help you determine how much of your added sugar budget a food or beverage contains. By January 1, 2021, all foods and beverages will be required to list added sugars on food labels. Until then, look for other names for added sugars like: agave, brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, evaporated cane juice, fructose, fruit juice concentrate, fruit nectar, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, maple syrups, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose and turbinado sugar. The higher up these added sugars are on the ingredients list, the greater the amount of added sugar in the product.Cooking helps you reduce added sugarsUse fruits and spices to add flavor at breakfast rather than sugar. ""Rather than having sweetened oatmeal packets, make plain oatmeal and flavor with blueberries and cinnamon. I even like adding a pinch of cardamom for an extra flavor-punch,"" McGrane said.  You can also use sliced fruit instead of sugary jams on your toast and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. ""Sliced strawberries are my favorite, but peach, banana, and apple slices all work well, too,"" McGrane said.Opt for homemade rather than store-bought baked goods. This gives you full control over the amount of sugar in your desserts. In most recipes (except for yeast breads) you can reduce the sugar by a third without causing a noticeable difference in texture, McGrane explained.Make your own granola or protein bars. ""I like making chocolate chip cookie dough bites that are sweetened only with medjool dates, almond extract and mini dark chocolate chips,"" McGrane said.Create your own sauces and salad dressings. As condiments and sauces are often a hidden source of sugar in our diets, you can make your own versions while controlling the amount of sugar you add. Try using salsa as your condiment instead of ketchup. Two tablespoons of standard salsa contains 1 gram of sugar, compared to 6 grams of sugar in 2 tablespoons of ketchup, McGrane explained. If it feels impossible to escape your sugar cravings, start out by trying just one or two of these strategies. As you get the hang of those newly formed habits, slowly incorporate the other tips, one or two at a time. Taking a gradual path will help you curb your sweet tooth and set you up for improved health for the long haul. Isn't that sweet news?",2
126," (CNN)Not sleeping enough or getting a bad night's sleep over and over makes it hard to control your appetite. And that sets you up for all sorts of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes.The link between poor sleep and a greater body mass index (BMI) has been shown in study after study, but researchers typically relied on the memories of the participants to record how well they slept.Sleep apps on fitness trackers, smartphones and watches have changed all that. In a new study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers tracked sleep quality for 120,000 people for up to two years.  The results showed sleep durations and patterns are highly variable between people. Despite that, the study found people with BMIs of 30 or above -- which is considered obese by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- had slightly shorter mean sleep durations and more variable sleep patterns.It didn't take much less sleep to see the effect. People with BMIs over 30 only slept about 15 minutes less than their less weighty counterparts.There were some limitations to the study. Naps were excluded, other health conditions could not be factored in, and people who use wearable tracking devices are typically younger, healthier and from a higher socioeconomic status than those who do not wear trackers.""These are quite pricey devices, and remember, they are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,"" said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, the associate program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California. ""The results would need to be validated by the appropriate FDA-approved devices, and because the study is likely on younger people who are more economically well off, does that really apply to older folks we worry about with poor sleep?"" said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study.However, Dasgupta added, a major plus for the study is that it did monitor people for over two years, and the results corroborated prior research and were ""not surprising.""""While we cannot determine the direction of association from our study result, these findings provide further support to the notion that sleep patterns are associated with weight management and overall health,"" the authors wrote. ""The findings also support the potential value of including both sleep duration and individual sleep patterns when studying sleep-related health outcomes.""Link between sleep and eatingThere is a scientific reason why a lack of sleep is linked to appetite. When you're sleep deprived, research has shown, levels of a hormone called ghrelin spike while another hormone, leptin, takes a nosedive. The result is an increase in hunger.""The 'l' in leptin stands for lose: It suppresses appetite and therefore contributes to weight loss,"" he said. ""The 'g' in ghrelin stands for gain: This fast-acting hormone increases hunger and leads to weight gain,"" Dasgupta said.Another reason we gain weight is due to an ancient body system called the endocannabinoid system. Endocannabinoids bind to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana, which as we know, often triggers the ""munchies.""""When you're sleep deprived, you're not like, 'Oh, you know what, I want some carrots,'"" said behavioral neuroscientist Erin Hanlon, who studies the connection between brain systems and behavior at the University of Chicago, in a prior CNN interview.""You're craving sweets and salty and starchy things,"" she added. ""You want those chips, you want a cookie, you want some candy, you know?""A 2016 study by Hanlon compared the circulating levels of 2-AG, one of the most abundant endocannabinoids, in people who got four nights of normal sleep (more than eight hours) to people who only got 4.5 hours.People who were sleep-deprived reported greater increases in hunger and appetite and had higher afternoon concentrations of 2-AG than those who slept well. The sleep-deprived participants also had a rough time controlling their urges for high-carb, high-calorie snacks.Get better sleepWant more control over your appetite? Depending on your age, you are supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night. Getting less has been linked in studies to high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain, a lack of libido, mood swings, paranoia, depression and a higher risk of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers.So sleep a full seven to 10 hours a night, stick to a regular bedtime and get up the same time very day, even on weekends, experts advise. Adding exercise to your daily routine is a great way to improve your sleep and improve your health. After finishing one 30-minute physical activity, you'll have less anxiety, lower blood pressure, more sensitivity to insulin and you'll sleep better that night.You can also train your brain to get more restful sleep with a few key steps:During the day, try to get good exposure to natural light, as that will help regulate your circadian rhythm.Avoid stimulants (coffee, tea) after 3 p.m. and fatty foods before bedtime.Establish a bedtime routine you can follow each night. Taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, listening to soothing music, meditating or doing light stretches are all good options.Make sure your bed and pillows are comfortable and the room is cool: Between 60 and 67 degrees is best. Don't watch TV or work in your bedroom; you want your brain to think of the room as only for sleep.Eliminate all lights -- even the blue light of cellphones or laptops can be disruptive. Dull sounds, too. Earplugs or white noise machines can be very helpful, but you can create your own with a humidifier or fan.Does that sound hard? Then sign up for our sleep newsletter and take steps toward better sleep.",2
127," (CNN)With talk of the possible availability of a vaccine candidate heating up, you might have heard the term Emergency Use Authorization -- or EUA -- all over the news lately. But what is it exactly, and how does it apply to vaccines?Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests: a medical product that gets special authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration to be used during an emergency. Sometimes it's a product that has already been FDA-approved, but for another condition, and sometimes it's a new product that hasn't yet received the agency's green light.There is a lot of ongoing concern and debate about whether any vaccine candidate should be granted an EUA -- or outright approval -- without first completing Phase 3 clinical trials.The 411 of EUAsAccording to the FDA's website, during public health emergencies, the agency can use Emergency Use Authorizations ""to help make medical products available as quickly as possible by allowing unapproved medical products to reach patients in need when there are no adequate, FDA-approved and available alternatives.""But that's only if ""the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat the identified disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.""So, in essence, what an EUA does is speed up the process of getting potentially helpful  medical products authorized for a specific use to the public during a health emergency, without the rigorous testing and subsequent scrutiny that's usually required to get FDA approval -- which traditionally takes years.When the health emergency is over, ""then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,"" according to the FDA. But the manufacturer can still submit documentation to the agency for regular approval.The EUA hasn't been around that long. The process was included within the Project  Bioshield Act passed by Congress in 2004, which enabled the federal government to prepare and stockpile new ""medical countermeasures"" during a declared public health emergency.And despite issuing many EUAs over the years, only one vaccine has ever received one -- but it was in an unusual and controversial circumstance. In 1997, the Department of Defense began a mandatory anthrax vaccination program. Shortly thereafter, soldiers claimed the vaccine made them sick, so they sued and a judge put a hold on the program in 2003. The Department of Defense asked for an EUA that then overrode the court ruling in 2005, so it could continue vaccinating military personnel -- this time on a voluntary basis.EUAs during this pandemicDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA has granted EUAs many times to a wide range of medical products, such as ventilators; personal protective equipment, including masks; molecular and antigen tests to diagnose Covid-19, and serologic tests to look for antibodies; and even treatments, such as remdesivir  and convalescent plasma.An EUA can be revoked,as in the case of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. These drugs had already been approved to treat and prevent malaria, and showed promise against the novel coronavirus in laboratory studies. Small early trials in Covid-19 patients added to the optimism, and the medication was touted by President Trump. But larger studies found the medications to be ineffective in treating patients with Covid-19. Additionally, one of the side effects could also potentially be dangerous in people who had pre-existing heart conditions. After about two and a half months with EUA, the emergency authorization was revoked.Many experts see granting an EUA to a vaccine against Covid-19 as problematic. For one, vaccines are given to healthy people by choice, unlike medications that are given to gravely ill patients who might die without them. So drugmakers have a higher bar, so to speak, to make sure there are no unexpected side effects that make healthy people sick -- and the only way to find out is in large-scale trials, like those going on right now.The FDA has said it would hold a vaccine to a higher standard. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Thursday that requirements will be stricter than for an emergency use authorization for an experimental drug.""For us, for a vaccine for which there is adequate manufacturing information, if we going to do an emergency use authorization, it is going to really be like an emergency use authorization plus,"" Marks told a seminar hosted by Duke University's Margolis Center for Health Policy. On Friday Marks and Hahn said in a joint blog post they'd be issuing more guidance ""shortly"" about how much higher the bar might be.  They noted it is up to the manufacturer to ask the FDA either for an EUA or full approval, known as a Biologics License Application. With so much at stake, we understand the importance of being as transparent as possible about the work we do, including how we will make decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines,"" Marks and Hahn wrote.The FDA has already said it would want to see an efficacy of at least 50% -- meaning any vaccine, to be considered, would need to reduce the risk of infection or of serious illness by at least 50% over a placebo.In a string of tweets by Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor and the dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, earlier this month, he noted that ""EUAs involve substandard or lesser reviews. How can you justify a substandard or lesser review for something that would be injected in tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of Americans?""Additionally, Hotez pointed out that the mRNA technology being used in two of the vaccines that are the furthest along in Phase 3 trials -- the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine -- is ""a new technology that has never before been licensed. We have no history or experience on such vaccines. Even more reason for a full/comprehensive review.""Hotez also brings up the point that in this highly politicized climate, there is a lack of confidence and trust in the government and federal agencies. ""We've seen how in 2020 the White House has abused the EUA mechanism - remember the EUA for hydroxychloroquine that was revoked? Neither does the White House or Dept. HHS,"" he tweeted.Political subtextThere is also the worry that the President is looking to make a vaccine available for political reasons during the run-up to the November election.President Trump has said several times he thinks a vaccine could be available by Election Day. Without a doubt, the pace of medical innovation has moved faster than ever before, and human vaccine trials began just 67 days after the virus was first identified. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told public health officials to prepare to distribute a potential vaccine as early as end of October. And FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said he'd consider an EUA before Phase 3 trials are complete.Still, several government health officials have told CNN the idea that a vaccine could be available to the general public by November 3 is unlikely. ""There is a big concern about the sort of political expediency and when this [October] date was being picked ... and just picking this date, before the election, sort of stokes those fears that the government isn't being duly diligent to make sure that any vaccine really is not just efficacious, but has few side effects,"" said Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and former director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the CDC.""So, we're all optimistic that there are currently three vaccines in Phase 3 trials -- that maybe one of these vaccines is so excellent that you don't need to vaccinate 30,000 people to find that it's going to work. However, the concern is that if you don't do a full set of these so-called Phase 3 trials, that you will miss rare side effects,"" he said on CNN earlier this month.When a vaccine -- or other medical product -- is given to enough people, rare side effects can turn up. In 1976, the government  launched a  hastily produced  vaccine about seven months after the Ford administration was led to believe a pandemic caused by a new strain of flu was imminent.The pandemic never materialized, but 40 million people got vaccinated under a compulsory program. That vaccine was later linked to a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine. The link was never proved, but the program was stopped.Also, in order to demonstrate efficacy of the vaccine, dozens of people in the placebo group would need to become infected, while very few -- if any -- infections would be seen in the vaccinated group of trial participants. It may take weeks, if not months, to see that difference between the two populations.Lack of trustThe lack of public trust and vaccine hesitancy are real. A CNN poll in August showed 40% of Americans do not want to get a vaccine when it becomes available -- even if it is cheap and easy to get. Such a low uptake of the vaccine could hurt the country's ability to get the virus under control and return to normalcy.If history is any indication, skepticism -- if not outright mistrust -- about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new. In a study published in 2009, months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 influenza and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, researchers explored the public's willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an EUA (not full FDA approval) by surveying a representative sample of more than 1,500 US adults. They found more than 77% of respondents would be moderately, very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine; 63% said they would not take it.But there were also some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an EUA was safe to use. If the vaccine were administered by a public health professional, 55% of respondents say they would take it. If it came with a fact sheet, just over 57% of those surveyed said they would get it. And if it were administered by their own health care provider, that number shot up to 68%. Transparency is key in gaining trust.Those in charge of the country's health agencies -- Alex Azar at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Francis Collins at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the FDA's Dr. Stephen Hahn and the CDC's Dr. Robert Redfield -- have all tried to reassure Americans that politics will not play a role in when a vaccine becomes available.Fauci has said he believes a vaccine will likely come closer to the end of the year, and that he wouldn't be comfortable with making a vaccine widely available unless the scientific evidence backed it up. ""I'm not a regulator. I mean, I just do the science. I'd report the science in an accurate way, and certainly if I saw interference, I would be very disturbed and call it out,"" Fauci told CNN's Jim Acosta on ""The Situation Room.""As for an emergency use authorization, ""I would not be comfortable with a vaccine unless it was shown in a clinical trial clearly to be safe and effective,"" Fauci said during an interview on NBC's ""Today."" Dr. Luciana Borio, the former acting chief scientist at the FDA, agrees that a vaccine must be shown to be safe and effective first and foremost.But if a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, it should not be withheld until all the stringent licensure requirements for FDA approval are met, because some of the requirements cannot be generated quickly.""Safe & effective vaccines can save lives and help contain the pandemic,"" Borio tweeted. ""The EUA is the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for distributing vaccines that have been shown to be safe & effective in phase 3 RCTs (randomized controlled trials) but have not yet met all of the FDA's standards for licensure.""  Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine program, said that ""it would be unethical"" to not move quickly to put out a Covid-19 vaccine if it is proven to work.""If we know a vaccine is 70% or 80% or 90% effective, it would be unethical to hold it back,"" Slaoui said during a CNN interview on Friday.On Tuesday, nine biopharmaceutical companies, including those who are furthest along in their vaccine testing programs, signed an unusual pledge to uphold ""high ethical standards,"" suggesting they won't seek premature government approval for Covid-19 vaccines.They pledged to ""Only submit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA.""In fact, later that same day, AstraZeneca, one of the signatories of the pledge, said it had paused its trials globally because of an unexplained illness in one volunteer in the UK. The drugmaker called the halt ""a routine action.""""In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline,"" AstraZeneca said in a statement sent to CNN.According to the FDA's guidance, any vaccine -- whether under emergency authorization or approved -- needs to either prevent disease or at least decrease severity by at least 50%.Despite all the intrigue, it may be worthwhile to circle back to the original criteria for an EUA -- in particular, the stipulation that it only be granted when ""there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.""While most people understandably don't want to hear it, there is a reasonable alternative, which has worked well  in many places around the world, and that is abiding by basic public health measures: wearing a mask, maintaining physical distance, practicing good hand hygiene and staying away from large, especially indoor crowds -- especially indoors.Following those rules will significantly reduce the likelihood of people getting sick, and slow the transmission of the virus. It will also buy us more time to make sure we get the evidence supporting the vaccine totally nailed down.",2
128," (CNN)While many colleges and universities are offering classes online, that hasn't necessarily stopped students from gathering. And now some college towns are grappling with outbreaks of Covid-19 as the start of the fall semester complicates local responses to the pandemic. ""We are urging students to understand the imperative role that they play in stopping this community spread and, ultimately, saving lives,"" said Mayor Aaron Stephens of East Lansing, Michigan, where Michigan State University students were asked to quarantine after the local health department reported 342 new cases among people affiliated with the university since August 24.The outbreak started as students returned to East Lansing for the fall semester, the health department's statement said. MSU resumed classes on September 2. And while most are online, many students had ""binding off-campuses leases or simply desired to physically return to the university community.""""MSU is committed to doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" MSU Physician David Weismantel said. ""The safety of our entire community is a priority and we all have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus.""Kelly Girtz, the mayor of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia -- home to the University of Georgia -- told CNN Saturday his city has seen a ""dramatic spike"" in cases after maintaining lower case counts and death counts throughout the summer. UGA classes began August 20.""Clearly it's the return to campus of large numbers of students who are not here through the summertime,"" he said.""Certainly young people are going to do the things that young people do, so we need to create the underlying conditions that keep people safe,"" Girtz said, calling for better coordination among state and national leaders. ""So that means very low allowance of gatherings and really as much digital or online learning as possible.""Six students at Miami University in Ohio were cited after holding a house party even though at least one of them tested positive for Covid-19, according to police records. The university declined to comment, citing federal privacy laws, but said students would face disciplinary action if they violate quarantine orders or the city ordinance on mass gatherings.Arkansas reported a record high of 1,107 new cases on Friday, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson said a backlog in testing was to blame. About 13% of the state's cases were attributed to young people in college communities, according to Dr. José Romero, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health -- though he said that was down from previous counts, calling it a ""good indicator."" More than 6.4 million infections have been recorded in the US and 193,482 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Air pollution from wildfires could lead to vulnerabilityDoctors warn that bad air quality stemming from smoke produced by the wildfires ravaging Western states could make people more vulnerable to coronavirus infections.""Multiple studies have shown a correlation between higher levels of pollution in the air and greater spread and severity of Covid-19 cases,"" said Dr. Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, citing several studies conducted in the United States, China and Italy. ""Some studies have also shown that exposure of lung tissue to pollution may increase susceptibility to viral infections.""Smoke from wildfires can irritate the lungs and cause inflammation that can affect the immune system, said Dr. Rekha Murthy, an infectious disease specialist at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. That inflammation can make people more at risk of lung infections. ""Whenever the lining of the lung or the airways become inflamed or damaged, it increases the potential for inhaled viral particles to take hold in the lungs and cause infection,"" Murthy said.There are also concerns that smoke-filled air will drive coronavirus-positive people indoors, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. That, she said, could potentially increase the spread of the virus. ""We know being outdoors versus indoors reduces the rate of transmission ... but now people are being told you have to go indoors because you don't want to breathe in the air that could cause respiratory issues,"" she said. ""But you don't want to be indoors with other individuals and have a higher rate of contracting COVID-19... so, it's really a catch-22.""To prevent the possible spread of coronavirus during the intense fire season, those remaining indoors due to poor air quality should stay away from anyone who is not in their immediate household, Wen said.Early mask wearing would have saved livesAbout 150,000 of the lives lost would have been saved if more Americans wore masks earlier on in the coronavirus pandemic, a health expert says.  ""If the President had said from day one everyone is wearing a mask, we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" said CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University. Reiner pointed to how Germany handled the pandemic. ""They haven't been the best. They haven't been the worst. They've been OK in their pandemic response and they've had about 10,000 deaths,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett.The US has four times the population of Germany. ""So we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" he said. ""So about 150,000 people would be alive.""He reiterated the importance of embracing masks. ""If you want to think about why we still have 40,000 cases a day and 1,000 deaths a day in this country, it's because we're still talking about masks,"" Reiner said. ""It's so basic.""More deaths predicted if people let their guards downAn influential model is predicting a catastrophic winter with a significant rise in coronavirus deaths.A possible scenario sees 415,090 Covid-19 deaths by January, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington says in its latest forecast. The worst-case scenario is 611,000 deaths by January 1.""When we look ahead into the winter with seasonality kicking in, people becoming clearly less vigilant, you know mask use is down, mobility is up in the nation, you put all those together and we look like we're going to have a very deadly December ahead of us in terms of toll of coronavirus,""  IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper.Despite the dire prediction, President Donald Trump says the US has done ""really well"" in fighting the virus. ""I really do believe we're rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there, but not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump said. Speaking with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not agree with the President's statements.""We're plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day, and the deaths of around 1,000,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He said test positivity is increasing in some regions of the country and people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather.""That's not good for a respiratory-borne virus,"" he said. Fauci warned that the country needs to get the levels down lower ""so that when you go into a more precarious situation, like the fall and the winter, you won't have a situation where you really are at a disadvantage right from the very beginning.""",2
129," (CNN)The AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial, halted last week after an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers, will resume, the University of Oxford announced Saturday.The university, which is developing the vaccine with AstraZeneca, did not say when the trial would resume. AstraZeneca said the trial will only resume in the United Kingdom, adding that it's working with health authorities across the world to determine when other trials can resume. Before the pause, the company was testing its vaccine, dubbed the Oxford vaccine, in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa.The university said in a statement that some 18,000 individuals around the world have received study vaccines as part of the trial. ""In large trials such as this, it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety,"" the statement added.US National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told a Senate hearing Wednesday that pausing a trial was a standard precaution that is meant to ensure experimental vaccines don't cause serious reactions among participants.""To have a clinical hold, as has been placed on AstraZeneca, as of yesterday, because of a single serious adverse event, is not at all unprecedented,"" Collins said at a hearing of the Senate Heath, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. The companies promised to wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely.AstraZeneca did not provide any details on the issue that caused the trial to stop. While AstraZeneca didn't specify what the issue was, at the hearing on Wednesday Collins said the AstraZeneca hold was due to a ""spinal cord problem.""On Wednesday, AstraZeneca issued a statement denying news reports that suggested the trial was stopped because of a case of transverse myelitis -- a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord. On the same day, AstraZeneca said it had paused its coronavirus vaccine trial not once but twice because of adverse events. ""We can also confirm that there was a brief trial pause in July while a safety review took place after one volunteer was confirmed to have an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which the independent panel concluded was unrelated to the vaccine,"" a company spokesperson said.The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the US. It has the backing of the US federal government. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTec are the other two groups with Phase 3 trials under way, also with federal government funding.",2
130," (CNN)Primary school students in China experienced more depressive symptoms and made more suicide attempts after schools closed for the pandemic, a new study found.When Covid-19 hit China in January, the Ministry of Education postponed the start of spring semester to late April. That closure separated children from their friends and their broader community network, and seems to have had an impact on their mental well-being.The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, compared reports of mental health problems in November -- before the pandemic started -- to mid-May, two weeks into the new spring semester when schools had re-opened.Researchers from Anhui Medical University got results back from surveys for 1,241 students who were in grades 4 through 8, and in junior high. The kids lived in Chizhou, Anhui Province, an area that did not have a large number of Covid-19 cases.Nearly 25% of the students reported depressive symptoms in May, when only about 19% did in November. Suicide attempts more than doubled -- at 6.4% in May compared to the 3% who made suicide attempts in November. There were no similar increases seen in reports of children who reported feeling an increase anxiety.Researchers hope school leaders will use this research to prepare the necessary mental health services to help children as they return to school following the lockdowns.This study is consistent with others that have found that enforced social isolation can cause mental health challenges for children.Benefits of in-person school outweigh virus risksAs states grappled with how to safely reopen schools earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics led a push for students to be physically present in classrooms rather than continue in remote learning for the sake of their well-being.The group, which represents and guides pediatricians across the country, updated its back-to-school recommendations in June to say evidence shows the academic, mental and physical benefits of in-person learning outweigh the risks from the coronavirus.""The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school,"" the group said on its website.""""The importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020. Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation,"" the group said.What it looked like when schools reopenedThis overhaul of the traditional school day become reality in August, as schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Indiana opened their doors for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic abruptly shuttered classrooms across the United States -- all while the virus remained largely uncontrolled.More students and teachers tested positive for Covid-19, some schools were forced to suddenly change plans, while others opted to delay the start of the school year giving educators more time to prepare for in-person classes.""What we do know is children have a harder time social distancing. And we can't put a whole bunch of them in a classroom with a teacher right now,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in an August briefing announcing a delay.""Other states that have tried to open this new school year are now having to close. We don't want to start and stop. That may be more difficult on our children,"" he said.Now, many have embraced virtual learning, which has posed its own set of challenges.Schools across the country have reported system outages, cyberattacks and other issues that prompted some districts to postpone the first day of class.If you're experiencing a suicidal crisis, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or text the Crisis Text line by texting HOME to 741741 to get help.",2
131," (CNN)Vaccine clinical trials are notoriously difficult to conduct.They involve thousands, or even tens of thousands, of participants, and typically go on for years. The chances that one or more of these study volunteers will develop a health issue is quite high.Most of the time, that health problem is not related to the vaccine being investigated, and the trial can continue. But sometimes there is a chance that the issue -- called an ""adverse event"" in medical parlance -- could be related to the vaccine.In that case, the trial is paused so the incident can be investigated.On Wednesday, it came to light that pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had paused its coronavirus vaccine trial not once but twice because of adverse events. The second pause is still in effect while researchers look into one volunteer's ""unexplained illness.""While Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Wednesday implied that pausing a Phase 3 trial was a somewhat common occurrence, vaccine trial experts interviewed by CNN say it is not common.""It's unusual to pause a Phase 3 trial on a safety basis,"" said Dr. Carl Fichtenbaum, an infectious disease expert at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. ""It's uncommon.""One trial, two pausesAstraZeneca announced Tuesday it had paused global trials of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the study participants.Then on Wednesday, a company spokesperson revealed the trial had also paused briefly in July to investigate an illness in another study volunteer, who ""was confirmed to have an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which an independent panel had concluded was unrelated to the vaccine.""AstraZeneca is one of three companies in the US currently in Phase 3 trials for a coronavirus vaccine. Each trial is aiming to enroll 30,000 people; half will get the vaccine and half will get a placebo, which is a shot of saline that does nothing.""With that many people, it's inevitable that someone, at some point, will get sick,"" said Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.Carrie Wolinetz, associate director for science policy at the National Institutes of Health, agrees. ""Adverse events happen in the normal course of very large trials. It's really a matter of determining whether it's a coincidental event or was it really something linked to the trial itself,"" she said.The coronavirus vaccine trials are what's called ""double blind,"" so when someone gets sick, neither the participants nor the doctors know if they received the vaccine or the placebo.The only people who know are members of the trial's Data Safety and Monitoring Board -- an external group of experts that monitors the trial.Each trial has its own protocol, but when an illness arises that causes concern, the DSMB will see if the volunteer received the vaccine or a placebo.If the volunteer received the vaccine, then the questions begin. If it's believed that the illness might possibly be related to the vaccine, the DSMB might recommend that the trial pause while the illness is investigated.After investigating, the DSMB might recommend that the trial continue as before, or it might suggest a change in the trial protocol, or it could recommend that the trial be shut down.On Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, commented on the AstraZeneca trial pause.""It's unfortunate that it happened. Hopefully they'll work it out and be able to proceed along with the remainder of the trial, but you don't know. They need to investigate it further,"" Fauci said.Hitting the pause buttonRedfield said Wednesday that in his research, he at times had to put trials on hold.""I've conducted a number of clinical trials in my days, both at Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center] and University of Maryland, of which I had the trial put on hold because of adverse reactions until we could evaluate whether that adverse reaction was something that was associated with the investigational product, and if so, was it serious enough that we then had to stop the trial,"" Redfield said at an online forum held by Research!America.Redfield did not specify whether he meant vaccine trials, nor did he specify whether he meant Phase 3 trials or trials in earlier phases, which can be more prone to adverse events because the vaccine hasn't been as well tested.CNN reached out to a spokesperson for Redfield for clarification, but they did not provide a comment.Illnesses that necessitate a pause don't occur very often, according to three vaccinologists -- Frenck, Fichtenbaum and Dr. Saad Omer -- who, combined, have worked on more than 100 vaccine trials.""In Phase 3, it's uncommon to have a pause,"" Frenck said. ""I've seen it happen a few times.""He estimates that pauses in Phase 3 trials due to a study subject becoming ill happens ""in under 10% of trials -- probably under 5%.""According to Fichtenbaum, ""Phase 3 trials don't typically pause. I've only seen it handful of times in my experience.""Both Fichtenbaum and Frenck have served on DSMBs. Additionally, Frenck is a researcher in both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer coronavirus vaccine trials, and Fichtenbaum is an investigator in the Moderna coronavirus vaccine trial.Omer is director of the Yale Institute for Global Health and has been the principal investigator in several vaccine trials.""It's not unheard of that a trial has paused. It's a very real possibility,"" he said. ""But I wouldn't call it common.""Confusion about the cause of AstraZeneca's most recent pauseAstraZeneca on Wednesday issued a statement denying news reports that suggested the trial was stopped the second time because of a case of transverse myelitis -- a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord.""Reports claiming to be based on comments made earlier today by our CEO stating that we have confirmed that a participant in our clinical trial suffered from transverse myelitis are incorrect. He stated that there is no final diagnosis and that there will not be one until more tests are carried out,"" a spokesperson for the pharmaceutical giant said in a statement emailed to CNN.""Those tests will be delivered to an independent safety committee that will review the event and establish a final diagnosis,"" the spokesperson added.The New York Times had quoted a source saying a trial volunteer had transverse myelitis. And STAT News reported that the company's CEO, Pascal Soriot, told investors in a conference call that the trial was stopped because a woman volunteering in the trial had symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis.While AstraZeneca didn't specify what the issue was, at a Congressional hearing Wednesday, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said the AstraZeneca hold was due to a ""spinal cord problem.""""With an abundance of caution, at a time like this, you put a clinical hold. You investigate carefully to see if anybody else who received that vaccine or any of the other vaccines might have had a similar finding of a spinal cord problem,"" Collins explained.He added that ""this ought to be reassuring to everybody listening,"" as this shows the ""focus first on safety.""",2
132," (CNN)Growing up with ""Sesame Street"" in the early 1980s, I found pieces of myself in Cookie Monster's sweet tooth, Big Bird's gentleness and in Grover, who was outgoing and always willing to help others, even though he made a lot of hilarious mistakes. There was even a lady named Maria who was Puerto Rican, just like my family. Maria (played by actress Sonia Manzano) looked and sounded like one of my aunts. I wanted to be a flower girl when she married Luis on ""Sesame Street."" And then along came the movies, which sealed my lifelong obsession with Jim Henson's Muppets.Seeing ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" when I was 7 changed my life. Just like the characters, I studied theater in college, moved to the Big Apple to make my dreams come true and even started doing stand-up comedy, just like my hero, Fozzie Bear. Friendship. Perseverance. Hope. The Muppets helped me get through the lean times and sang along with me when I celebrated any small victories. I didn't know that these amazing characters would prepare me to raise my own child during the rough times we'd face over the past few months. A deep dive into the MuppetsIn my 30s, I took my love of all things Muppet-related to academia. In graduate school, I studied the informal learning that happens for young children when exposed to Muppet movies and other media created strictly for entertainment. I found that kids as young as 3 years old were able to recognize and categorize positive and negative characters, behaviors and situations. Young kids also learned language while being entertained by these movies and television programs, especially when watching with a parent or other close adult. The children immediately picked up new words, when placed in context, and learned more complicated words and ideas by asking the adult watching along, ""What does that mean?""There is much more beneath the surface of ""Sesame Street""'s curriculum-based programming, too. My friends on ""the street"" taught me my ABCs and 123s, of course. But I also learned about helping others, community and what to do with all of the big feelings that took over my little body. These lessons carried with me throughout my life and shaped my relationships with others.I was 18 years old when my grandmother, who was the heart of my family, died. I remember my younger cousin, who was about 7 years old, struggling to understand and cope with her passing. The well-meaning adults, lost in their own grief, used flowery language — ""she's resting in peace,"" ""she's passed on,"" ""she's gone."" As tears streamed down his face, my cousin called out for her and wanted to see her again. I tried to help him understand the permanence of the situation. It didn't even occur to me at the time that I was using the same language the grown-ups on ""Sesame Street"" had used to help Big Bird and 6-year-old me understand Mr. Hooper's death. Helping me parent in a pandemicI had no idea how valuable these lessons of kindness, honesty and emotional intelligence would become once I became a parent. Back in March, a week after my son's third birthday party, I picked him up from preschool. We stopped at the local grocery store — where everyone knows him by name — and went home. We didn't realize that would be the last time my kiddo saw anybody beside his parents for six months — and counting. Like so many American families, when we first began our stay-at-home safety measures, we really thought it was only going to be for a couple of weeks. A month, tops. My son is a tiny empath. One time, I told him that his swim class had been canceled because his instructor was sick. Instead of being upset that he had to miss his swim lesson, my son cried with worry over his teacher's mystery ailment. ""Oh no! What's wrong with Mr. D? Will he be OK?"" That's why, when faced with a global pandemic, my husband and I chose not to ring the alarm bells right away. We told our son that it was just time for everyone to stay at home and spend time with their families for a while, like a little vacation. That seemed to satisfy him.As I grew anxious about the situation at hand, I turned to ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" and channeled Dr. Teeth and the lyrics from ""You Can't Take No for an Answer:""""Whatcha gonna do when the dimes get toughAnd the world's treating you unkind?You gotta hang on to your optimistic outlookAnd keep possession of your positive state of mind""Our family took walks, read stories and made beautiful messes, but it wasn't easy. As more time passed, it was becoming harder to juggle entertaining a toddler and keeping up with our work commitments.  There are big germs out thereAs it became clear that we were in this for the long haul, things in our home got a little looser. Rules and structure took a backseat to safety and comfort. And my son started asking more questions. It was time to change the language we were using. When we potty-trained my son, we talked a lot about hand-washing and germs. So I knew I had a familiar place to start the conversation. We talked about the time he got a runny nose at school because his friend had a runny nose, how he had a fever and how we had to go to the doctor. I told him that there are some big germs out there, and if we get together with lots of friends, it might make us all not feel well. I was honest without scaring him with the gravity of Covid-19. He took it in stride and then said, ""OK. You wanna make some animals with my Play-Doh?""Sure, maybe I left out the fact that some of his friends are, in fact, back at school. I'm heartbroken about everything he's missing out on. Every family has difficult choices to make — and there is no one correct answer. I'm not a parenting expert. I'm just a working mom doing the best I can to keep ""sweeping the clouds away"" for my boy. Sometimes, he has a question I can't answer. Instead of making something up — even toddlers can smell baloney a mile away — I'll say ""I don't know. Let's try to figure it out together."" It's what Kermit would do. 'Smarter, stronger, kinder' That's been the mantra sung at the end of every episode of ""Sesame Street"" since 2016, and it's something I try to take to heart every day. Not just as a parent but as a person living on this planet in 2020.Last night, my kid went to bed happy, healthy and safe. To quote his favorite Cookie Monster song, that's ""good enough for me.""",2
133," (CNN)After time off from exercising, it's understandable if you're having a hard time getting motivated. You may even feel a bit bad, but I'm here to say it's important to go easy on yourself. Even if you start ever so slowly, know that returning to a workout routine means you'll soon get those feel-good serotonin and dopamine boosts from exercising. And let's face it, with so much time cooped up at home due to coronavirus lockdown measures, it's been all too easy for many of us to gain a couple of pounds or more. But if you join me, we can all be in this together.  Now let's think about the path to get back on track. While it might seem tempting to try to whip yourself back into shape by jumping into heavy weight training or intense cardio out of the gate, this cold-turkey approach will overstress your system — and you could easily hurt yourself by training too hard, too soon. That's why I'm sharing a seven-part series of weekly articles to safely guide you back into an effective workout regimen that will set you up for long-term success. This first one sets the foundation by guiding you into a positive mindset and getting you moving in the right direction. There will be plenty of time later in the series for intensive workouts, but for now, we're going to ease our way back. So, whether you're reestablishing an exercise routine — or even starting for the first time — read on for an easy three-step process to get you on a consistent path.READ PART II: Master body-weight movements: How to reboot your workout routineReconnect your mind and bodyWhen getting back into an exercise regimen, it's natural to focus on how much better we want to make ourselves look, but let's stop for a moment and think about how physical activity will improve the way we feel. Any negativity we might be feeling about our bodies being ""out of shape"" actually stems more from our minds and bodies being out of sync.Remember, physical activity produces those feel-good chemicals in our brains that reinforce our positive mind-body connection. Developing this mind-body connection gets you in a positive mindset and will help you establish a sense of control and respect for your body, paving a path for your exercise efforts that's sustainable — which, in turn, will lead to achieving your goals. READ PART III: Strength training with free weights: How to reboot your workout routineStep one: Mind your muscle movementWhen trying to restore and strengthen this connection after being sedentary, I recommend practicing this progressive muscle contraction/relaxation daily for a week and then several times per week thereafter. This is best done lying down, but you can do it from almost any position as it relies on muscle contractions with very little to no movement.Begin by focusing your attention in your body, on your breathing. During this exercise, your breath will serve as the link between your mind and muscles.Inhale as you close your eyes tightly and tighten your jaw by clenching your teeth. Exhale as you release the tension, letting your eyes remain gently closed. Inhale fully into your rib cage and hold your breath, creating tension in your chest, upper back and neck. Exhale to release. Inhale and squeeze your hands into fists, trying to make contact and create tension in all the muscles of your arms. Exhale to release. Inhale to contract your glutes and pelvic floor muscles while tightening your abdomen as well. Exhale to release. Inhale to curl your toes and create tension in all the muscles of your legs. Exhale to release.Take five additional, long, deep breaths, while your mind rests in awareness of your body's state of total relaxation. READ PART IV: Get moving faster with cardio: How to reboot your workout routineBreathe into good postureThe safety and efficacy of any exercise program is predicated on executing proper form. If your posture is poor and movement is restricted, it'll be difficult to perform almost any exercise safely. So, it's in your best interest to optimize your breathing before beginning or restarting an exercise program.What does breathing have to do with posture and movement? The short answer is: everything. The shallow, upper-chest-oriented breathing pattern many of us have fallen into reduces the function of our diaphragm, requiring upper-body muscles to compensate as accessory breathing muscles that lift the rib cage during inhalation. This creates painful, movement-limiting, chronic upper-body tension and poor posture. For more on the biomechanics of proper diaphragmatic breathing, check out my article ""Breathe better to move better: Train to breathe like a pro athlete."" READ PART V: Biking your way to better health: How to reboot your workout routineStep two: Move your ribs while breathingRegularly practicing breathing better will decrease tension to restore mobility and establish good posture  for proper exercise form. Here's a basic way to practice every day:Sit comfortably in a chair with your hands resting on your legs. Close your eyes. Begin lengthening and deepening your inhalations and exhalations. As you breathe, concentrate on the movement of your rib cage. Inhale, filling the lowest lobes of your lungs so that your lower ribs externally rotate and expand out to the sides. When you exhale, completely empty your lungs, using core muscles, almost like an abdominal crunch, to move your lower ribs in, back, and down toward your waist.Repeat this for five to 10 breaths, practicing several times per day.If you're having trouble getting your ribs to move, place your hands on your lower ribs while you breathe, so that you can guide them in and out under your fingers. You can also try the breathing bridge exercise featured in my recent article on exercises to offset too much sitting.READ PART VI: Safely ramp up exercise intensity: How to reboot your workout routineWalk your way to a healthy routineWhen establishing an exercise routine, consistency is the key to long-term success. Ideally, exercising regularly needs to become a lifestyle habit akin to toothbrushing. Rather than diving head-first into an overwhelming workout that's too time-consuming and strenuous to sustain, begin by forging an easy-to-accomplish daily walking habit.Because walking is so accessible, people often discount its benefits, making it one of the most underrated fat-burning, mind-body exercises.Step three: Establish a walking habit Start by walking just five to 10 minutes daily over the first few days while you figure out the best time and place for your walks. Once you've determined the logistics, begin adding a few minutes more to each walk. Ideally, you want to get up to about 20 to 30 minutes per day.On days you can walk longer, that's great, but don't put pressure on yourself to do more, which could sabotage your daily habit. Likewise, on days you can only walk a few minutes — still do it. Of course, if you walk outside, the weather won't always cooperate. On those days, a few sets of walking lunges inside or marching in place might be your only alternative (if you don't have access to a treadmill). The important thing is that you do something active during the time you would've normally walked. Don't break your habit!Keep in mind that walking at a moderate-to-brisk pace can be very effective for fat burning. This is especially true when in a fasted state (not having eaten in a few hours). When your stomach is empty and insulin levels are low, your body relies on fat as its primary energy source.READ PART VII: Why recovery is the key to effective exercise: How to reboot your workout routine In terms of mind-body benefits, when you take your walks disconnected from your devices, it gives your mind a much-needed tech break, enabling you to tune into the sensations in your body. Even better, walk outside to gain the health benefits of green space and vitamin D.Here are some additional ways to increase the health benefits of your walks.Once you've established a daily walking habit, it creates a platform for sustainably expanding your exercise program.This is especially true when in a fasted state (not having eaten in a few hours).

But to ensure long-term success, it's important to map out a logistical plan of where and when you'll be training to avoid unexpected hiccups that can quickly snowball into excuses not to work out.When? Not having enough time is probably the most common excuse for skipping exercise. Don't let that be your excuse! If you can't find a dedicated 30- to 45-minute time slot at least three times per week, trade out your daily walking time on those days.Where? Will you be returning to your old gym? If so, are you comfortable with the safety precautions they have in place to fight coronavirus? Is there potential for gym capacity limitations to impact your ability to work out during the time frame you've allocated?If you're planning to work out at home, it's important to create a dedicated home workout space, so you don't run into issues like clutter or other family members needing the space.Remember these three stepsDevelop a strategy that helps you anticipate and deal with potential issues before they arise. And leverage the three-step process in this article to set your foundation:1. Use the progressive muscle contraction/relaxation exercise to strengthen your mind-body connection.2. Practice breathing with rib movement to create good posture.3. Walk every day to establish a daily exercise habit. Using the three steps above, you'll not only build a foundation for returning to regular exercise but forge a commitment to a healthier lifestyle that's built to last.

134," (CNN)Wildfires have broken out across the United States on an unprecedented scale, with 77 large complexes of fires engulfing 3 million acres in a matter of weeks.While the fires themselves only cover a small portion of California, Oregon and Washington, at least 24 people have died as of September 11. And the smoke they are producing is creating a widespread health problem.Satellite images show smoke covering much of the Pacific coastline, with major cities there seeing very high Air Quality Index numbers, indicating unhealthy air. That's a problem for the elderly and young children, as well as those with asthma and Covid-19 or other breathing conditions.""The weather and geography in the Bay Area and valleys of California can also trap the smoke close to the surface, which can keep the smoke trapped near the ground at certain times of the day in certain locations where people live and breathe,"" said CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller.Here's some advice for reducing your exposure risk and keeping yourself and your family safe.Wildfire smoke includes particles from burning vegetation and building materials mixed with gases. If your eyes feel like they're stinging, smoke exposure could also be inflicting other damage. Particles could be getting into your respiratory system.Exposure can cause chest pain, a fast heartbeat or wheezing or bring on an asthma attack. Besides coughing and trouble breathing, many people experience symptoms similar to a sinus infection, such as headaches, sore throat, a runny nose and even tiredness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Wildfire smoke can be especially harmful to the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with chronic heart and lung diseases. Because children breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults and their airways are still developing, they may experience more severe symptoms.Some people may even experience illnesses like bronchitis due to the fine particles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Those with asthma or lung disease living in wildfire country should consult their doctors.Staying healthy when it's smokyIf you see a haze, smell smoke or know of a wildfire in your area or a place you plan to visit, check the Air Quality Index to see whether you need to limit your time outdoors.When advised to stay inside, keep your windows and doors closed. It's OK to keep the air conditioner running, but the CDC recommends making sure the filter is clean, and close the fresh-air intake to prevent smoke from entering.It's also important to keep indoor air clean by not burning candles, using gas stoves or fireplaces, or smoking. Running a vacuum can also keep particles circulating in the air.Dust masks actually trap large particles and don't protect your lungs from smoke inhalation, but a mask that uses a filtering respirator can offer some protection. The CDC also has tips for how effective different types of masks can be, depending on your exposure.Even if the air outside or in your home looks clear, it may not be free of harmful microscopic particles, especially if the wildfires and smoke persist for weeks.Pediatric pulmonologists at the Breathing Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado also recommended changing your clothes if you've been outside, rinsing out red, irritated eyes and drinking fluids to keep from being dehydrated. Parents should seek emergency care for their children if they experience real difficulty breathing or a change in their level of consciousness.There is a low risk of long-term effects of wildfire smoke exposure for healthy individuals.",2
135," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci said it could be the end of 2021 before life gets back to how it was before Covid-19.""If you're talking about getting back to a degree of normality which resembles where we were prior to Covid, it's going to be well into 2021, maybe even towards the end of 2021,"" Fauci said Friday.A vaccine will help, but there are caveats, Fauci said in a series of interviews Friday.   Fauci has said repeatedly that it's possible at least one of the vaccines being tested could get emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year or early next year. But it won't be available to everyone immediately.""By the time you mobilize the distribution of the vaccinations, and you get the majority, or more, of the population vaccinated and protected, that's likely not going to happen to the mid or end of 2021,"" he  told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell. One stumbling block -- keeping the vaccines cold. Most of the experimental coronavirus vaccines must be kept frozen. Speaking during a Friends of the Global Fight webinar earlier on Friday, Fauci said, ""One of the things that's always an issue is the cold storage issue, and the 'cold chain' that is so often required."" Debunking nonsensePlus, people are not always doing what they should do to control the spread of the virus, even now, Fauci said.""When you're dealing with a situation that requires behavioral change, we in the United States have a significant issue that I'm very disappointed in,"" Fauci said during the webinar.""It was stunning to me ... that in some states and cities and counties, you would see television clips of people crowded indoors at bars, which is a superspreading event if you ever saw it.""Young people may think they are not going to get dangerously ill, and get careless, Fauci said.""But what they forget is their societal responsibility to not propagate the outbreak because if they get infected, they're likely going to infect someone else who then might infect someone who really is vulnerable and will have a serious severe consequence."" And people are spreading misinformation, making the virus even harder to fight.""The one thing that bothers me is the amount of things that aren't evidence-based, and we've seen examples of that in the United States like claims that certain drugs have a great positive effect when there's no scientific evidence whatsoever that they have a positive effect,"" Fauci said.""And yet it gets ingrained and I and my colleagues have to spend a lot of time trying to debunk that. And you're in the middle of a pandemic and you're trying hard to address all the appropriate issues, it is truly a waste of time to have to debunk nonsense.""Fauci also cautioned that just because coronaviruses are in the spotlight, people should not forget  the flu.""The one thing I've learned throughout the years is don't put anything past the flu -- don't take anything for granted,"" he said during the MSNBC interview. There ""a hint of potential good news"" when it comes to flu season. In Australia, where the flu season just ended, ""They have had the lightest flu season in memory -- which most people think is because they're doing things to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection with masks, distancing, avoiding crowds, outdoor more than indoor. That what they've done as a secondary offshoot of that is they brought down the level of influenza cases, very, very low,"" he said. He added that if  Americans can do this, he's optimistic the country will have a light flu season too. ",2

137," (CNN)Marvel might have reached into its quiver once too often with ""Hawkeye,"" at least based on the first two episodes, which offer a slow start tilted more toward the character of Kate Bishop than the titular Clint Barton. Amusing in places, this holiday-themed series makes jokes about trick arrows, but it's going to need a few more tricks up its sleeve.The premiere finds Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) in New York City with his kids, leaving his beyond-patient wife (Linda Cardellini) behind. But the early focus is on the young Kate (Hailee Steinfeld) and her origin story, having lost her dad and -- inspired by Hawkeye's example -- committed herself to mastering combat and archery, which fairly quickly comes in handy.Kate essentially stumbles onto a strange conspiracy, and in the process runs across an artifact that's destined to catch Clint's attention. He's understandably cranky, however, about getting drawn into a mystery that will keep him in New York, threatening the family time for which he's been hoping with Christmas only a few days away.As with ""WandaVision"" and ""Loki,"" ""Hawkeye"" cleverly calls back to earlier moments in the Marvel universe and exhibits no great hurry to disgorge secrets, including what the true danger might be. Fans also get to see a bit more of Renner (pulling series double duty right now in ""Mayor of Kingstown"") as the hero in family-man mode, a wrinkle seemingly made for a series format.As initially lined up, though, the battles the pair face involve a particularly tired bunch of miscreants. Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly.So what's left? One genuinely laugh-out-loud funny gag in the first episode, and the interplay between the curmudgeonly Clint and the enthusiastic Kate, with Steinfeld well-chosen for some sort of baton (or arrow) pass, but moderately fleshed out as a character in the early going.Beyond entering the world of superheroes, Kate's issues also include her mom (Vera Farmiga, underused at first) having entered into a new relationship with Jack (""Better Call Saul's"" Tony Dalton), who provokes Kate's suspicions.Marvel's series for Disney+ have cleverly used the platform to more fully explore established characters while simultaneously planting seedlings for future offshoots -- a logical strategy for all sorts of reasons, which has allowed the studio to experiment with different kinds of shows. That's certainly cheaper than jumping directly into something like ""Eternals"" on the big screen.While not employed thus far, the ""Hawkeye"" trailer does reveal that there will be trick arrows before it's over. Yet unless that arsenal significantly improves the show's payload, the guy who once said he couldn't miss might rather ironically be associated with a Marvel series that conspicuously does.""Hawkeye"" premieres Nov. 24 on Disney+.",2
138," (CNN)Kevin Hart stays close to his comfort zone in one respect in ""True Story"" -- playing a wealthy and famous comedian -- while stretching in another, in a dark drama of cascading stakes and consequences. Also producing the Netflix limited series with ""Narcos'"" Eric Newman, Hart delivers a crisp and compelling drama that, at seven episodes, avoids the mistake of prolonging the act beyond its weight.The series notably follows another dramatic role by Hart for Netflix, the movie ""Fatherhood,"" a much softer exercise.Here, he plays Kid, who comes to play in his hometown of Philadelphia, where a night out with his support-hungry brother Carlton (Wesley Snipes) triggers a major crisis, forcing him to engage his brother's help to clean up the mess, while being drawn into the orbit of some very, very bad people.Kid is also juggling high-profile movie roles, but his off-screen performance to appear cool and collected under these trying circumstances is a little hit-miss, with his agitated behavior unsettling his manager (Paul Adelstein) and causing friction among those around him. Much of the kick in ""True Story"" involves seeing the world through Hart's eyes, or at least the equivalent of them, as someone who is under constant scrutiny but receives plenty of benefits, all while dealing with adoring fans, one of whom (well played by ""Sons of Anarchy's"" Theo Rossi) figures prominently in the plot.Yet ""True Story"" mostly works as a pass-the-popcorn affair, where each apparent escape from the hangman's noose yields an unexpected twist that drags the comedian further into this nightmare, threatening the career he has struggled to build, and revealing how far he'll go to protect that.Indeed, if Kid seems miscast for this world of true crime, as he says at one point regarding his stardom, ""They don't know what I did to get here.""The story also zeroes in on the tension between the two brothers, with Kid having bailed Carlton out in the past, but now more prone to rely upon him under these extraordinary circumstances. ""I got this,"" Carlton reassures him.Streaming has become an ideal platform for stars like Hart to explore other creative avenues without having to fret about opening-weekend concerns.""True Story"" achieves a delicate balance, providing a kind-of glimpse behind the central character's (and by extension Hart's) velvet-roped existence while taking on its own life as a solid thriller that tells a tight, self-contained story.While nobody would want another season of that -- after all, how unlucky could one guy be? -- it is the kind of polished production that as Hart spreads his dramatic wings makes you eager to see what he'll do for an encore.""True Story"" premieres Nov. 24 on Netflix.",2
139," (CNN)Jennifer Lawrence has revealed that she is ""nervous"" about returning to the spotlight after taking a step back when she felt ""everybody had gotten sick of me.""The Oscar winner spoke to Vanity Fair magazine for its December issue cover story in a wide-ranging interview, touching on the challenges of fame, a near-death experience, the trauma of having intimate photos leaked online and the gender pay gap.Lawrence, who is expecting a baby with husband Cooke Maroney, is due to make her return to the screen with Adam McKay's comedy ""Don't Look Up.""Speaking to Vanity Fair, the 31-year-old star said: ""I'm so nervous... I haven't spoken to the world in forever. And to come back now, when I have all of these new accessories added to my life that I obviously want to protect.""The interview touches on the movies Lawrence worked on before she took a step back from the spotlight, which included ""Passengers,"" ""Mother!"" ""Red Sparrow"" and ""Dark Phoenix.""""I was not pumping out the quality that I should have,"" she said. ""I just think everybody had gotten sick of me. I'd gotten sick of me.""Lawrence said she had started to think she couldn't do anything right.""If I walked a red carpet, it was, 'Why didn't she run?'... I think that I was people-pleasing for the majority of my life,"" she said.Now Lawrence is pregnant and, although she declined to talk about how she feels about becoming a mother, she did share her thoughts on protecting her child.""Every instinct in my body wants to protect their privacy for the rest of their lives, as much as I can. I don't want anyone to feel welcome into their existence. And I feel like that just starts with not including them in this part of my work,"" she said. In 2014, a hacker leaked nude photos of Lawrence and other female celebrities. The actress spoke about the impact this has had on her.""Anybody can go look at my naked body without my consent, any time of the day,"" she said. ""Somebody in France just published them. My trauma will exist forever.""She also recounted an experience from 2017 when a small private plane she was traveling on had to make a hard emergency landing after both of its engines failed.""Flying is horrific and I have to do it all the time,"" she said, explaining how she had started leaving ""little mental voicemails"" to her family as the plane hurtled towards the ground.Lawrence, previously named the world's highest-paid actress, also touched on the reported pay discrepancy between her and ""Don't Look Up"" co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. ""Look, Leo brings in more box office than I do. I'm extremely fortunate and happy with my deal. But in other situations, what I have seen -- and I'm sure other women in the workforce have seen as well -- is that it's extremely uncomfortable to inquire about equal pay,"" she said. ""And if you do question something that appears unequal, you're told it's not gender disparity but they can't tell you what exactly it is.""The film airs on Netflix next month and CNN has reached out to the streaming service for comment.Read the full cover story ""A Happy New Year"" by Karen Valby in Vanity Fair's December issue and on VanityFair.com.",2

143," (CNN)Sandra Bullock has shared the big screen with Keanu Reeves twice -- but she's down for a third and even has an idea. Speaking to Esquire magazine for a profile on her ""Speed"" co-star, Bullock said she'd ""love nothing more than to do a comedy with Keanu before we both die."" (Grim, but OK.) ""He's funny. We can be seventy-five—it'll be even better then, like an old-people 'Cocoon' thing,"" she told the publication. ""We play two funny old people. A road trip. Just put us in an RV as old people. It'll be the bookend of 'Speed'! We'll just be driving really slowly. Pissing the world off. There's our movie.""While waiting 18 years for this to happen doesn't sound appealing, the spirit of the idea is solid. Hollywood, your move. Elsewhere in the profile, by writer Ryan D'Agostino, Bullock recounted working with the ""Matrix"" actor on the iconic action movie in the early 90s and the bond they shared after. (In 2006, they'd star together again in ""The Lake House."") Though they were never romantically involved, she said, Reeves was and remains and uniquely thoughtful person. She told one story about offhandedly mentioning in a conversation with Reeves that'd she'd never had Champagne and truffles, only to have him show up at her door days later with flowers, Champagne and truffles. ""That's what I mean that it drives you crazy,"" Bullock told the magazine. ""When I first met him, I would spend as much time as I could filling a silence, just to feel comfortable. And the more I jibber-jabbered on, the quieter he would get. And I thought, I don't understand what's happening! He's looking at me with eyes of confusion. He's quiet. Did I say something to offend him? And then a day or two later, he would arrive with a note or a little package, saying, 'I thought about what you said.' And he would have his response.""She added: ""How many people do you know like that?""One, Sandra. And the Internet would say, he's breathtaking. ",2
144," (CNN)""House of Gucci"" takes a seemingly can't-miss combination of talent and material and produces what feels like the knockoff version of a really grand drama. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver bring buzz to director Ridley Scott's dive into the dysfunctional family behind the fashion empire, but in a movie that doesn't rise to the level of delicious trash, winding up largely defined by its stylish accessories.Based on a book and covering nearly two decades from the late '70s into the mid-'90s, the film hinges on the relationship between Gaga's Patrizia and Driver's Maurizio Gucci. The heir was at first disowned by his father (Jeremy Irons) for marrying a lower-class girl, before being wooed back into the fold by his colorful uncle Aldo (Al Pacino), who sees Maurizio as having more potential to lead the family business than his foppish son, Paolo (Jared Leto, under the most unflattering makeup since Tom Cruise suited up for ""Tropic Thunder"").The story begins briskly enough, as Patrizia clearly sets her sights on Maurizio, making his father's suspicions that she's ""after your money, like they all are"" appear not all that far-fetched.Once together, he's happy as an outcast but she yearns for more, pressuring him to get back into the family's good graces and eventually to push for greater control at the expense of his relatives, despite frequent reminders that her claim to the ""Gucci"" name comes by marriage, not blood.""It's time to take out the trash,"" Patrizia says, in one of those lines seemingly written for use in the coming attractions.It's a very age-old story, but one that takes unexpected turns as the money rolls in, and the authorities take notice of the family's finances.Still, other than Leto's over-the-top, scenery-chewing performance ""House of Gucci"" really doesn't go the extra mile to stress the absurdity of it all, which makes the whole exercise at times feel more like a slightly bloated, inordinately star-studded Lifetime movie than either of the two obvious alternatives -- namely, a Coen brothers-esque farce, or a truly gripping tale of lust and greed.Instead, this old ""House"" can be enjoyed for the toothiness of its performances (although the accents, Driver's foremost, take a little getting used to) and the soapy situations without feeling like the attraction this mix of marquee names in front of and behind the camera was intended to yield.After her breakout work in ""A Star is Born,"" Gaga demonstrates she's not just a one-trick pony, capturing Patrizia's avarice and allure, which causes her father's male employees to simultaneously applaud and issue catcalls when she saunters into his business. As for Driver, his unusual year has included the bizarre musical ""Annette"" and period drama ""The Last Duel"" (also with Scott directing), reflecting just how in-demand the actor is without fully bolstering the case as to why.Certainly, the detailed touches that went into the movie's look and sound prove impeccable, from the disco music in the early going (you might walk out humming Donna Summer tunes) to the flashy fashions and runway shows.Go in with the right attitude, in other words, and ""House of Gucci"" can still be a good deal of fun. It's just that despite all its extravagant furnishings, it's built on a shaky foundation.""House of Gucci"" premieres Wednesday, Nov. 24 in US theaters. It's rated R.",2
145," (CNN)Eddie Redmayne has addressed the controversy surrounding his Oscar-nominated role in ""The Danish Girl,"" calling his decision to play transgender pioneer Lili Elbe in the 2015 drama a ""mistake.""  The ""Fantastic Beasts"" star, who is preparing for a new West End production of ""Cabaret,"" was speaking to UK publication the Sunday Times. ""The Danish Girl,"" directed by Tom Hooper, is inspired by the story of Elbe, one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Although Redmayne was nominated for a string of awards for his performance, his casting as Elbe  prompted complaints, with many critics arguing that the role should have gone to a trans actor.At the time, trans writer Carol Grant described his casting as ""regressive, reductive, and contributes to harmful stereotypes."" She said: ""What should've been a celebration of a very complex, compelling transgender figure is instead transmisogynist, and just plain-old misogynist in general."" In his interview with the Sunday Times, Redmayne said the criticism was justified, admitting that while he had the best intentions, taking the role was a ""mistake"" and he wouldn't accept it if it were offered today. ""No, I wouldn't take it on now,"" the 39-year-old star said, adding: ""The bigger discussion about the frustrations around casting is because many people don't have a chair at the table. There must be a levelling, otherwise we are going to carry on having these debates."" Redmayne can next be seen playing the Emcee in ""Cabaret,"" opposite ""Chernobyl"" actress Jessie Buckley as Sally Bowles. Liza Minelli famously played Bowles and Joel Grey was cast as the sexually ambiguous Emcee in the 1972 film adaptation Redmayne asked those who might criticize his decision to take on a role often played by LGBT actors to suspend judgment. ""Of all the characters I've ever read, this one defies pigeonholing. I would ask people to come and see it before casting judgment,"" he said. ""Cabaret"" opens opens at London's Playhouse Theatre on December 12.",2
146," (CNN)An arbitrator has ordered Kevin Spacey to pay almost $31 million to Media Rights Capital, the production company behind ""House of Cards,"" the Netflix series in which the actor starred for five seasons until he was fired in 2017.The revelation came in a petition filed Monday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, in which MRC is asking the court ""to confirm the award in its favor and enter judgment against Spacey and his loan-out and producing companies.""Spacey and MRC have been battling in the years since the actor was dismissed from the production over allegations of misconduct on and off the set.In its filing, MRC states that in October of 2020, an arbitrator found Spacey ""repeatedly breached his contractual obligations"" while starring as Frank Underwood on the Emmy-winning show and that his behavior ""rendered him (and his affiliated entities) liable"" for the millions of dollars lost by MRC.  MRC says the company suspended Spacey following CNN's report in 2017, in which several current and former members of the ""House of Cards"" production staff came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. One person also accused Spacey, who was an executive producer on the series, of sexual assault. ""MRC had no knowledge whatsoever of any such conduct by Spacey with any cast or crew associated with the Show,"" the filing states. Shortly before CNN's report, actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed News that the actor made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986 when he was 14 years old. MRC says it halted the production ""to address any concerns of the show's cast and crew"" in wake of the allegations, according to the filing. Following Rapp's claims, Spacey issued a statement claiming he did not recall the incident and apologized for what he said would have been ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""After Spacey was terminated, the petition says that MRC had to ""rewrite the entire season to omit Spacey's character, and to shorten Season 6 from 13 to 8 episodes to meet delivery deadlines"" and suffered monetary losses as a result.Following the arbitrator's decision, MRC released a statement on the ruling, ""The safety of our employees, sets and work environments is of paramount importance to MRC and why we set out to push for accountability.""

152," (CNN)Adele is known for moving fans to tears with her music, but the Grammy award-winning singer shed some of her own after a surprise reunion with a former high school teacher.  The emotional moment happened during the British powerhouse's ITV concert special, ""An Audience with Adele,"" which aired in the UK on Sunday night. During the pre-recorded concert, the pop superstar took a question from Hollywood actress Emma Thompson, who asked whether there was anyone in her past who had supported her, inspired her or protected her from life's trials and tribulations.  In response, Adele opened up about the impact Ms. McDonald, her English teacher at Chestnut Grove Academy, had had on her. The London-born singer shared: ""I had a teacher at (south London high school) Chestnut Grove, who taught me English. That was Miss McDonald... She got me really into English literature. Like, I've always been obsessed with English and obviously now I write lyrics."" ""She was so bloody cool. So engaging,"" Adele added, recalling that McDonald often wore sequins and gold bracelets. ""She really made us care, and we knew that she cared about us."" Thompson then revealed that McDonald, whom Adele hadn't seen in 20 years, was in the audience. It was time for the singer, who is used to surprising fans at her concerts, to be left stunned. In the clip shared on ITV's Twitter account from the highly anticipated televised UK concert special, Adele embraced her former mentor after she was brought on stage. ""I'm so proud of you,"" McDonald said as Adele cried tears of joy. During their exchange, the ""Easy On Me"" hitmaker told McDonald: ""You really did change my life.""  ""Now, I've got to get my whole face re-done,"" the 33-year-old star joked while wiping away tears. She then called on host Alan Carr to step in and entertain the audience with a song while she stepped away to regain her composure After the special aired, Adele took to Twitter to share her excitement at the reunion.  ""Home Sweet Home. I've always dreamt of doing An Audience With..."" she wrote alongside a series of pictures from the TV special, adding: ""There was so much love in the room for each other, it felt like such a gig!

157," (CNN)Stage parents seldom fare well in movies and TV, but ""King Richard"" bucks that trend, placing Will Smith on center court in an overwhelmingly flattering portrait of tennis patriarch Richard Williams. Smith aces the performance, which is the main attribute in elevating the story above the standard sports-movie conventions.The film actually follows a fairly concentrated stretch in the formative years of Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams (Demi Singleton) under the watchful eye and tutelage of their father Richard, who speaks frequently of the 78-page plan he mapped out for conquering the nearly all-White tennis world before they were old enough to hold a racquet.""I'm in the champion-raising business,"" Williams announces as he makes the rounds looking for a coach, met with dismissive and vaguely racist replies, including ""You ever think about basketball?""Williams can be imperious (hence the title) and overbearing, much to the occasional chagrin of his daughters and wife (Aunjanue Ellis), who is no wallflower when it comes to the coaching chores or speaking her mind.The portrait that emerges from director Reinaldo Marcus Green and writer Zach Baylin consistently paints him as a heroic figure, protecting his daughters from dangers in the community, stressing their education as well as their ground strokes and working tirelessly to advance their careers, perusing tennis magazines while holding down a job as a night watchman.Any excesses, such as having the girls practice in a pouring rain, are filtered through that prism. And obviously, Williams' determination to ""stick to the plan"" paid off handsomely, despite the irritation and exasperation of tennis coaches (the most prominent played by Tony Goldwyn and Jon Bernthal) riled by his refusal to follow the customary script, including his decision to pull Venus out of juniors tournaments.Smith not only captures the cadence of Williams' voice but the unwavering confidence that he embodied, absolutely convinced that he knew what was best for his girls. It's down the movie's final stretch, as those plans begin to bear fruit, that ""King Richard"" feels more and more conventional, from the stirring music to the questions of how and when to cash in on Venus' prowess while the younger Serena is left behind, but as we all know, not for long.Smith (who also produced the film) is receiving a vigorous push for awards consideration, and he certainly nails the role in a way that belongs in that conversation, even if the movie as a whole seems unlikely to join him.Perhaps foremost, ""King Richard"" is framed as a response to the criticism and second-guessing that the outspoken Williams faced as his daughters took the tennis world by storm, which might explain why both signed on as executive producers.Indeed, it's hard to escape the sense that ""King Richard"" exists in part to let the Williams family set the record straight. And when it comes to giving Williams his due as both a tennis guru and a father, in this case, love means everything.""King Richard"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters and on HBO Max, from Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia.

158," (CNN)In a directorial father-son baton pass from Ivan Reitman to Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air""), ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is undeniably nostalgic and fairly sweet, while who-ya-gonna-calling directly back to the 1984 original. And yet with its focus on teenage heirs to that legacy, the movie simultaneously feels as much like the Disney Channel version of ""Ghostbusters"" as a long-delayed sequel.Happily, the kids are the very talented Mckenna Grace (""Gifted,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale"") and ""Stranger Things'"" Finn Wolfhard, the grandchildren of Egon Spengler (originally played by the late Harold Ramis). Egon has died, leaving a remote farmhouse to his estranged daughter (Carrie Coon), who for financial reasons finds the move timely.Moving into the place, Phoebe (Grace) and Trevor (Wolfhard) discover a lot of strange stuff happening around town -- starting with all those unexplained earthquakes -- and some nifty artifacts among grandpa's possesses. Phoebe possesses scientific acumen far beyond her years, while her brother mostly just crushes on one of his new classmates (Celeste O'Connor).Mom, meanwhile, strikes up a somewhat unexpected relationship with one of the kids' teachers (Paul Rudd, seemingly everywhere at once), adding to an adult component that produces some laughs but frankly rides in the passenger seat for much of the movie. (Coon is a gifted actress, but there's a bit of the ""E.T."" mom syndrome here, where she can't see all the weirdness happening her.)Cleverly, the film (written by Jason Reitman, Dan Aykroyd and Gil Kenan) does set up a dense mythology connecting this flurry of spectral shenanigans back to the 1980s, while playfully incorporating visual touches that recall the ""Ghostbusters"" of the past. There are also funny unrelated gags, such as Rudd's character getting through summer school by simply running wildly inappropriate horror movies.In some respects, ""Afterlife"" represents a rather conspicuous exercise in fan service, after the bizarre temper tantrum thrown by some in response to the female version of the concept that premiered five years ago. While that movie was flawed, the reaction seemed completely out of whack, elevating ""Ghostbusters"" to an overblown level of ""You ruined my childhood!"" exaltation.The elder Reitman serves as a producer on the movie, which -- with Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson promoting the movie -- isn't the only link to its Reagan-era roots. Still, this is one of those films that doesn't so much cross the streams as dip into a deep well of goodwill, hoping to bridge the gap between those who actually saw the original in a theater and kids and grandkids who will hopefully identify with the youthful protagonists.At its best ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" simply delivers a good time, combining the upgraded special effects with comedy and youthful angst, while taking a little too long to get to the good stuff.Broken down into those components, the younger Reitman has dutifully answered the call to carry on his family legacy, without quite conjuring the kind of sparks that would have made ""Afterlife"" completely rise to the occasion.""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.",2

160," (CNN)HBO has a storied history with female quartets, from ""Sex and the City"" to ""Girls."" Yet ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" carves out its own niche with a distinct voice and plenty of very funny material, capturing four young women from diverse backgrounds thrown together as roommates while coming of age as first-year college students.Co-created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, the HBO Max show actually has a lot to say, in part by uniting women whose differences in terms of race, class and geography are somewhat eclipsed by sharing the process of discovering themselves and carving out identities apart from their parents.""Mom, I'm not bringing my teddy bear to college with me,"" one complains during the moving-in stage at New England's Essex College, nicely capturing the middle ground between independence and childhood that this period uniquely represents. Cue the slow-motion shots of shirtless guys jogging, the skepticism about a boyfriend who wants to wait until marriage (""Boys are born ready, so something's up"") and issues about grappling with sexual identity.The producers have helped the process by assembling a very good cast, including Pauline Chalamet -- Timothee's sister -- as Kimberley, a wide-eyed arrival from Arizona who forever seems to be saying the wrong thing, and who lacks the connections and financial resources of her roommates. The remaining trio, Bela (Amrit Kaur), Leighton (Reneé Rapp), and (Whitney) Alyah Chanelle Scott, are equally good, with Kaur garnering the biggest laughs as a kid eager to cut loose out now that she's escaped her parents' supervision.While this is hardly new terrain, ""Sex Lives"" manages to be occasionally sweet in addition to funny, such as when a couple of them attend a ""naked party"" and get chided for looking down at others', um, nakedness.""So we're not supposed to look? What is this, a naked party under Taliban rule?"" Bela complains.Later, Whitney -- the daughter of a senator -- grudgingly attends a fraternity party along with the wealthy Leighton, telling the sea of blond girls that she meets, ""I look forward to seeing you all on 'Selling Sunset' one day.""Amid the jokes and uncomfortable situations (including a positively cringeworthy dinner during parents' weekend in a later episode), there's an almost palpable sense of the desperate desire to fit in, as well as how significant the college years are in defining people as they mature.In that sense, ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" is a rather simplistic, marketing-friendly title for a show that's refreshingly about a lot more than that.As it happens, the series will conclude the same day that HBO's ""Sex and the City"" revival hits the streaming service, a nod to the genre's past. If ""Sex Lives"" is in some respects a spiritual heir, it makes a strong case that meeting the next generation has more creative promise than revisiting an earlier one.""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" premieres Nov. 18 on HBO Max.

162," (CNN)Lin-Manuel Miranda is not throwing his shots, and in 2021, the creator of ""Hamilton"" has been getting a whole lot of them.After his earlier work ""In the Heights"" became a critically admired (if little seen) movie, Miranda has made his directing debut with ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!,"" a loving adaptation of ""Rent"" creator Jonathan Larson's coming-of-stage story, and written eight original songs for ""Encanto,"" a Disney animated film featuring a predominantly Latinx cast. That follows another animated movie, Netflix's ""Vivo,"" which he produced in addition to writing the music.Although he is working from a script by Steve Levenson (""Dear Evan Hansen""), Miranda has clearly approached ""Tick, Tick"" as a deeply personal ode to musical theater in general and in particular Larson, who tragically died on the eve of what would become ""Rent's"" record-breaking run at the age of 35.Deftly expanding the source material into a movie, the film is anchored by a sensational performance by Andrew Garfield as Larson, with the title referring to the sense that his bravado about becoming ""the future of musical theater"" is running dry, with timing running out, in his eyes, as he approaches his 30th birthday.Capturing the creative process on film also poses a tricky proposition, but Miranda mostly manages to do just that, while conveying the palpable anxiety that Larson feels about at what point he transitions from being a writer who waits tables to make ends meet to becoming ""a waiter with a hobby.""The echoes of ""Rent"" throughout are also everywhere, reflecting how Larson eventually went from trying to sell an esoteric concept set in the future to writing about subjects very close to home, including struggles to keep the lights on (literally) and the ravages of AIDS at the time.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" is filled with happy surprises, and Garfield receives able support from Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesus and Vanessa Hudgens, as well as Bradley Whitford as legendary composer Stephen Sondheim.If Larson took the right advice when he decided to ""write what you know,"" Miranda, as a director, has taken that advice to heart as well.As for ""Encanto,"" feeling like an outcast is one of the most durable themes in Disney animation, which has become more relevant as those movies have moved in a more progressive direction than ol' Walt's early days. ""Encanto"" reflects a more recent tradition, in a movie about what makes us special, seriously enlivened, again, by Miranda's musical gifts.Miranda did the same for ""Moana,"" and ""Encanto"" possesses many similar charms, with a sizable dollop of ""The Incredibles"" in its focus on a super-powered family. The main departure, and it's an interesting one, is the lack of a traditional villain, an absence that's felt but mostly overcome by the warmth and energy behind the execution, which effectively draws audiences into the story.Set in a magical town in Colombia, Disney's 60th animated feature begins with a nod to a particularly sober real-world phenomenon -- namely, the plight of refugees. But amid their loss comes the magic that has made the Madrigal family flourish, with each possessing a remarkable gift under the watchful eye of matriarch Alma (María Cecilia Botero).Everyone, that is, except Mirabel (""Brooklyn Nine-Nine's"" Stephanie Beatriz), who emerged empty-handed from the gifting ritual, still determined  to be as much a part of the family as her parents and sisters.""Gift or no gift, I am just as special as the rest of my family,"" Mirabel tells the local children, but she seems as doubtful of the truth of that as they are.Still, just as one of Mirabel's cousins comes of age and her sister is about to marry, strange things start happening, with signs that the family's magic is beginning to fade. Mirabel thus becomes the Cassandra warning of danger, something her grandma has no interest in hearing, merely reinforcing Miirabel's sense that it has fallen to her to save everyone.Directed Jared Bush and Byron Howard (""Zootopia"") and co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, ""Encanto"" compensates for the dearth of traditional conflict with a colorful world filled with powers and an abundance of music.""I will never be good enough for you,"" an exasperated Mirabel says at one point.Happily, ""Encanto"" is plenty good enough for families seeking a sprinkle of that Disney animated magic, just as is ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" brings theater into the home.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" premieres Nov. 19 on Netflix. ""Encanto"" premieres in US theaters on Nov. 24. It's rated PG.",2
163," (CNN)""Queens"" is an extremely familiar idea, elevated not quite to the level of royalty by being slickly cast, packaged and produced. Like Peacock's ""Girls5eva,"" the concept hinges on an all-girl group reunited and again pursuing stardom 20 years later, rediscovering the spotlight and its perils after years spent braiding hair and burning breakfast.Those last mundane activities are how we meet Brianna (Eve), once known as Professor Sex, who is now raising five kids. Methodically, the show goes about introducing the rest of the quartet once known as the Nasty Bitches (a name itself rooted in the past), who, as Jill a.k.a. Da Thrill (Naturi Naughton), notes, ""stood on top of the world for a hot minute.""The other members of the group, Naomi/Xplicit Lyrics (Brandy) and Valeria/Butter Pecan (Nadine Velazquez), had a sour falling out, with the former toiling away as a solo act -- ""still chasing the fame that you found 20 years ago,"" as she's told -- and the latter having successfully transitioned into morning TV, where her unbridled ambition is on full display.It's their manager (Taylor Sele) who suggests getting the band back together as part of a televised event, and the lure of a quick payout is enough to erode the resistance on several fronts. But this is a series, after all, so the reunion won't end there, with the challenge of mounting a formal comeback and all the soapy doings that go with it.As noted, the idea of one-time stars nursing old grudges and grasping for another few minutes of fame is hardly a new one (Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" is an ode to one-hit wonders), but the hip-hop backdrop and casting gives ""Queens"" a relatively fresh feel. The disclaimer would be that once you get past the premise, the series becomes another soap set against the backdrop of the music world, a la ""Empire,"" meaning it will only be as good as the situations that the writers can continue to conjure.Produced by ""Scandal"" alum Zahir McGhee (who wrote the pilot) and directed by Tim Story, ""Queens"" appears to be in pretty good hands on that score, even if the content and actually-not-that-explicit lyrics can only be as nasty as ABC's standards will allow. The show also figures to get a boost, in old-fashioned TV scheduling terms, from having ""The Bachelorette"" as its opening act.For now, ""Queens"" has done an admirable job assembling the pieces. Keeping them from flaming out the way that the show's fictional group did could be another matter.""Queens"" premieres Oct. 19 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.",2
164," (CNN)Success hasn't spoiled ""Succession,"" as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of ""Veep"" blush.Having become HBO's version of ""Game of Thrones"" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of ""fine wines"" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, ""Can I do this? Can I win?""Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.While Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by ""Succession"" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with ""Veep,"" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.""Succession"" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that ""Game of Thrones"" comparison, the battles on ""Succession"" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.""Succession"" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",2
165," (CNN)Pete Buttigieg is such a smooth political operator that even the fly-on-the-wall access to his 2020 presidential run granted the makers of ""Mayor Pete"" only produces so much insight into his historic campaign. Mostly, the documentary premiering on Amazon serves as a social-studies lesson in how campaigns operate, with the most candid moments coming from those other than the candidate.Seeking to become the first mayor to graduate directly to the White House, Buttigieg always appeared to be running for national attention and some intermediate position, given the hurdles that the mayor of South Bend would face winning a statewide race in deep-red Indiana. Yet his long-shot campaign captured the imagination of many and caused brief flickers of hope that he could actually go the distance.Directed by Jesse Moss, ""Mayor Pete"" captures all of that, including Buttigieg's status as gay man and his decision to openly discuss that, as he says, ""without it swallowing who I was and what our campaign was about.""Still, Buttigieg speaks in such perfect sound bites that it's difficult even in these casual moments to penetrate those barriers. As a consequence, some of the most telling insights coming from his husband, Chasten Buttigieg -- who recalls that ""Nobody was out"" when he was in high school -- and campaign communications director Lis Smith, who peppers her dialogue with expletives as she bluntly lectures the candidate for being too clinical in answering questions that call for displays of passion or emotion.For all that, some of the behind-the-curtain glimpses are fascinating, from a friendly exchange with Joe Biden, his current boss, as the two run across each other on the trail to the strategizing with staff, from messaging to debate prep.""It's not even a debate,"" Buttigieg corrects them at one point. ""It's a media opportunity.""The filmmakers also catch the group briefly (and comically) stranded in an elevator, dealing with a crisis involving a police shooting in South Bend and at the moment when Buttigieg accepts that his improbable pursuit of the Oval Office has reached its end. ""That's how you end a presidential campaign,"" he says, with a tilt toward the camera, before opting to endorse Biden.Currently serving as Secretary of Transportation at the ripe old age of 39, Buttigieg clearly has plenty of runway ahead of him in terms of pursuing future political ambitions.Depending on where that leads, ""Mayor Pete"" is perhaps most significant as a snapshot of a very specific moment, and potentially a road map for the journey to come.""Mayor Pete"" premieres Nov. 12 on Amazon.",2
166," (CNN)A wave of ""smash-and-grab"" crimes is plaguing upscale stores in major US cities, with mobs of thieves making off with expensive goods in brazen, nighttime raids. At least 18 people broke into a Nordstrom department store in Los Angeles Monday night and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise, the city's police chief said.The thefts followed a rash of similar incidents over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. A group of thieves swarmed the Southland Mall in Hayward on Sunday evening, wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry store before grabbing items and fleeing.Three suspects were arrested Saturday night after a mob ransacked a Nordstrom department store in Walnut Creek, east of San Francisco. Some 80 suspects were involved, and they fled the outdoor mall in at least 10 different vehicles, police said. That robbery came after similar raids Friday night near San Francisco's Union Square, where thieves targeted Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Bloomingdale's stores, a Walgreens and cannibis dispensaries. And California isn't the only place grappling with ""smash-and-grab"" crimes. Fourteen robbers barged into a Louis Vuitton store in suburban Chicago last week and fled with more than $100,000 in handbags and other merchandise. So why so many recent incidents? Are they linked to the holiday season? Is it pandemic restlessness?  ""This has nothing to do with the pandemic,"" said Pete Eliadis, a former law enforcement official and founder of security company Intelligence Consulting Partners. ""The pandemic is overused at this point.""But security experts cited a mix of several other factors.Such cases aren't always a priority for law enforcement San Francisco has seen a surge in crime since it reopened in the pandemic. In the Central district, for example, larceny and theft incidents are up almost 88% from a year earlier, and overall crime is up almost 52%, according to police statistics.Many of the store thieves wear masks or hoods, making them difficult to identify even when they're spotted on security cameras.Police in Los Angeles and San Francisco have made some arrests, but thieves often face few consequences, Eliadis said. One reason for this is law enforcement's lack of resources, which means theft cases sometimes are put on the back burner, he said. And, he added, the ""defund the police"" movement has sapped some officers' morale.""There's no political will to prosecute the people in this climate. Why should a police officer waste time getting into an altercation when the person is not going to jail because it's overcrowded and a prosecutor is not going to prosecute that case because it's not high on the priority list?"" Eliadis said. ""The takeaway is we need the political will, more prosecution and backing of law enforcement.""Thieves may face few consequences The decriminalization of low-level offenses in some states has created opportunities for criminals to manipulate the system, said Lynda Buel, president of Ohio-based security consulting firm SRMC. For example, Proposition 47, a California ballot initiative passed in 2014, sought to alleviate prison overcrowding by reducing the penalties for some crimes. The measure raised the threshold for felony theft from $500 to $950.""For the low-level criminal, the benefit far outweighs the risk, since the threshold for a misdemeanor offense is $950 -- meaning that a person can steal up to that amount and only be charged with a misdemeanor,"" Buel said.Organized crime rings are often behind these types of ""smash-and-grab"" operations and pay low-level criminals to steal for them, she said.  Security experts said dismantling these sophisticated crime groups must be a law enforcement priority.""People see the ability to commit these 'smash-and-grab incidents' knowing that there is little consequence, especially if the thefts are kept below the threshold of a felony offense,"" Buel said. ""It's easy, it's fast, and the payback is good.""   The holidays provide more opportunities for theftIt's not unusual for ""smash and grabs"" to increase around the Christmas holiday season, Buel said. Stores stock up before the holidays, which means there's a bounty of merchandise to pick from. That means more opportunities and more convenience for the smash-and-grabbers, she said. But retail theft by organized gangs is not limited to the holiday season. In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law reinstating a task force to investigate organized theft at stores. ""This is not new in the state ... We've been organized in a very deliberative manner to address the issue of organized retail crime for a number of years,"" Newsom said. ""We are doubling down on those efforts today.""In Illinois, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in September that crime rings are costing retailers across the country an estimated $45 billion in annual losses. He created a task force to crack down on organized crime rings that target stores.""These brazen, violent crimes are committed by sophisticated criminal organizations that are involved in drug trafficking, human trafficking and other serious crimes,"" Raoul said.There are numerous places to sell stolen itemsOnce items are stolen, there are several ways to sell them -- all extremely easy and with little regulation and monitoring from law enforcement, experts said. Most items grabbed in such cases have no serial numbers, making tracing them almost impossible, Eliadis said. ""It is incredibly easy to sell stolen merchandise online through e-commerce platforms,"" Buel said. ""E-commerce has really taken off as the place to sell stolen goods.""Other thieves don't need to sell their stolen goods on Craigslist or eBay. They can also use flea markets, pawn shops and street vendors.  Thieves can sell expensive items at slashed prices, meaning there's no shortage of buyers, Eliadis added.The result is a ruthless cycle that affects everyone, Eliadis said. Some affected stores will shut down or relocate. And retailers plagued by thefts see their insurance rates and private security costs increase -- costs that eventually get passed on the customer. ",2
167," (CNN)President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced the release of emergency oil reserves to combat high energy prices ahead of the busy holiday travel season, but it will be weeks before the barrels hit the market. The Department of Energy will release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the White House -- the largest release from the reserve in US history, Biden said.Biden on Tuesday noted that the administration's actions ""will not solve the problem of high gas prices overnight."" ""It will take time, but before long, you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank,"" he said during his remarks. ""And in the longer term, we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy."" The release is aimed at addressing the lack of oil supply around the world, but its actual effect may be limited. In 2019, US petroleum use averaged approximately 20.5 million barrels of oil per day and in 2020 the US used on average about 18.1 million barrels per day, according to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. The EIA reports petroleum usage was lower in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The barrels of oil involved in Tuesday's announcement will not hit the market until ""mid to late December, depending on market take up,"" according to a senior administration official.""We're taking action. The big part of the reason Americans are facing high gas prices is because oil producing countries and large companies have not ramped up the supply of oil quickly enough to meet the demand. And the smaller supply means higher prices globally, globally, for oil,"" Biden said during remarks at the White House. This release will be in coordination with several other countries, including China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom. Officials believe the coordinated effort could potentially have more of an effect on lowering gas prices.As of Friday, there were 604.5 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Department of Energy.The move comes as the White House faces mounting pressure to lower skyrocketing prices at the pump that are contributing to the biggest inflation spike in decades, causing frustration and anger among Americans. The President on Tuesday called the issue a ""problem"" both in the US and around the world, and stressed that while spikes in prices are usually temporary, ""it doesn't mean we should just stand by idly and wait for prices to drop on their own.""Thirty-two million barrels will be in exchange ""over the next several months,"" the White House said, and those barrels will eventually return to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ""in the years ahead."" Eighteen million barrels ""will be an acceleration into the next several months of a sale of oil that Congress had previously authorized.""""American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic,"" the White House said in a news release. ""That's why President Biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply.""CNN previously reported Biden hoped to announce his decision to release the oil reserves during a Tuesday speech at the White House, but that the timing of such a move was still contingent on other nations finalizing their agreements.The President made his remarks just hours before he is set to leave for a Thanksgiving break on Nantucket off the coast of Massachusetts.Biden had been privately advised in recent weeks that tapping into the reserve wouldn't do much to alleviate the current problems, but some Democratic lawmakers argued it could provide temporary relief at the pump. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was among the Democrats leading the charge.Despite being told the impact may be negligible, the option to release oil reserves remained on the table, given Biden had few others, and officials believed coordinating with other countries could potentially have more of an effect. One option was increasing domestic oil production, but the White House has been wary of the optics of the President and his aides pushing for more drilling at home on the heels of the major UN climate summit COP26, where Biden promised that the US would ""lead by example"" on clean energy initiatives.The national gas price average as of Tuesday is $3.403, according to AAA, which is significantly higher than the average at the same time last year when many people were not driving or traveling as much due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is unclear how much the White House effort would immediately affect prices.The move may instead largely act as a signal to OPEC nations and Russia that the US is serious about taking action to lower prices after those nations were reluctant to ramp up oil production to reduce prices.Biden officials have warned the Saudis for weeks that the US would find alternative solutions if the price of crude oil topped $85 a barrel, officials said, which it did late last month. But Saudi Arabia has stood firm in refusing to increase output and has priced in -- wrongly, in the view of US officials -- the possibility that the US reaches a nuclear deal with Iran, two US officials said. The Saudis' concern is that sanctions on Iran would then be rolled back, allowing the country to ramp up its oil production and compete with OPEC+.Given that reluctance, the Biden administration viewed coordinating with the other nations as an attempt to undermine the cartel's control of the market.""The thinking has been, we can do this alone, or we can do it internationally -- and the latter would be much more effective, especially when it comes to sending a message to the Saudis,"" said one senior official involved in the discussions.Biden has taken other actions as well. Last week, the President asked the Federal Trade Commission to ""immediately"" investigate whether illegal activity by oil and gas companies is pushing up gas prices. That move isn't likely to have an immediate effect on gas prices for consumers, but is another example that Biden is seeking to show he is working to bring prices down. The FTC's findings could also help in the long run if they find wrongdoing. The oil industry's top advocacy group slammed that move as a ""distraction.""Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said at Tuesday's White House press briefing that gas and oil companies have financially ""taken advantage"" of the high prices.""We have 250 fewer oil rigs that are functioning today than we did before the pandemic, and yet, the oil and gas industry has leases on 23 million acres of public lands on and offshore,"" Granholm said. ""Over 9,500 permits have been issued that are not being used. At the same time, the energy industry is making enormous profits. They're back up to above where they were before the pandemic started. So, they have taken advantage of that moment.""This story has been updated with additional information. ",2
168,"New Delhi (CNN)Gulpreet Singh begs for food from a dirty hemp mat spread on the sidewalk outside Delhi's South Campus metro station.Like millions of Indians who survive on handouts or daily wages, the 84-year-old says he has no choice but to be outside, breathing air thick with smog in the Indian capital.""I come here and wait. Sometimes, people give me food,"" said Singh, his voice straining over the noise of auto rickshaws and cars belching fumes just meters away.Delhi is often ranked among the world's most polluted cities, and air pollution there reached ""hazardous"" levels in early November, according to India's National Air Quality Index (AQI), which tracks the presence of harmful particles in the air.But some Delhi residents have become so accustomed to bad air that it's a part of daily life -- they barely notice it, they say.Others say it's making them sick.Choking on smog    A police officer directing traffic at one of Delhi's busy junctions says pollution levels have become ""unbearable"" this winter.""I've taken off my mask because I need to blow the whistle to stop traffic, but it's been horrible,"" said the 48-year-old officer, who didn't reveal his name because he is not authorized to speak to the media.Exhaust fumes flow from the rows of vehicles around him -- he says he finds it hard to catch his breath.""My eyes hurt. It's hard to breathe. It's not easy,"" he said.Social worker Neelam Joshi, 39, says she feels the pollution every time she steps out of her house to catch the train to work.""When you leave the house in the morning, that's the first thing which hits you,"" Joshi said. By the end of the day, she says her body seems to have adjusted, but the next day, it happens all over again.""In the last six years that I have lived in Delhi, there's never been a reduction in pollution,"" she said. ""It only increases every year. Every year we reach a different level, and during festivals it always becomes worse.""Amanpreet Kaur, 28, a flight attendant from Delhi's Rohini area, recently crewed a flight from the United States and was stunned by the difference in air quality.""When I landed back into India, after my flight from USA, it was horrible. I'm continuously coughing,"" she said.Kaur says the smog is so bad that you can see it at night as a dirty haze around street lamps and car headlights.""When the sun sets, all you see is smog, just smog all around,"" Kaur said.""It's very dangerous to live in Delhi.""'My right to breathe'Aditya Dubey, an 18-year-old environmental activist, has spent the past two years lobbying for urgent action against Delhi's pollution.Every year, the city is plagued by a throat-searing cloud of murky smog, but it's worse in winter when lower temperatures and a drop in wind speed trap particles in the air for longer.""Winter has become a torture and every day feels like a punishment,"" Dubey said. ""I have a burning sensation in my eyes and they start watering. I feel breathless.""Last month, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tried to control pollution levels by banning firecrackers for Diwali, the festival of lights, but celebrations mostly proceeded as normal.The smoke from Diwali was exacerbated by a spike in the burning of crop waste in surrounding farmlands.By November 5, most locations in Delhi were recording an AQI above 500 -- the highest level on the scale.At that point, Dubey had had enough.The activist filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking protection for his ""right to breathe.""On November 15, the court ruled in his favor and ordered the central government to do more. Subsequently, schools were shut, non-essential traffic was suspended, construction projects were halted, and six out of 11 coal-fired plants were ordered to close until the end of November.Construction projects resumed Monday as Delhi recorded a marginal improvement in air quality. But for many, the damage had already been done.The 'silent killer'Delhi is not the only Indian city choked by smog.Last year, nine of the world's 10 most polluted cities were in India, according to monitoring network IQAir.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths a year globally, mainly as a result of increased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory infections.Bad air could be reducing the life expectancy of hundreds of millions of Indians by as much as nine years, according to a recent study by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).The study also found that every single one of India's 1.3 billion residents endure annual average pollution levels that exceed guidelines set by WHO.In 2019, the central government announced a national clean air campaign, with an aim to reduce particulate pollution by up to 30% by 2024. Specific plans were created for each city; in Delhi, those plans included measures to reduce road traffic, burn-offs and road dust, and to encourage the use of cleaner fuels.But in the past few years, India's pollution problem has worsened, partly due to the country's dependency on fossil fuels -- and in particular, coal.At the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, India was among a group of countries that pushed for an 11th-hour amendment to the agreement to phase ""down"" coal rather than phase it ""out"".In Delhi, noxious air is claiming tens of thousands of lives each year, according to analysis of IQAir data by Greenpeace.But despite the worsening air quality, some Delhi locals have become so accustomed to it they don't seem to notice.Many roam the streets without a face mask and have developed a general complacency toward pollution levels.Omprakash Mali, a 50-year-old gardener, say the air pollution doesn't affect him or his work.""We work with mud and in dust as a gardener, so I don't feel anything additional,"" he said. ""I think the top priority for the government should still be Covid-19. Pollution happens every year.""Meanwhile, Shesh Babu, 18, a manual laborer, said he ""doesn't really care"" about Delhi's thick smog. His priority is earning money.Dubey, the activist, says air pollution is considered to be an ""elitist"" issue.""Air pollution is a silent killer,"" he said. ""There is a lack of awareness. People don't realize the seriousness of it.""",2
169,"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN)A jury has awarded more than $26 million in damages after finding the White nationalists who organized and participated in a violent 2017 rally here liable on a state conspiracy claim and other claims.But the jury in the federal civil trial said Tuesday it could not reach a verdict on two federal conspiracy claims.The violence during the Unite the Right rally turned the Virginia city into another battleground in America's culture wars and highlighted growing polarization. It was also an event that empowered White supremacists and nationalists to demonstrate their beliefs in public rather than just online.Though the jury deadlocked on the two federal conspiracy claims, it slammed the defendants on the other claims with major awards to the plaintiffs, who included town residents and counterprotesters injured in the violence four years ago.Some of the most prominent figures of the alt-right -- Jason Kessler, Matthew Heimbach, Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell -- were among the defendants.""We are thrilled that the jury has delivered a verdict in favor of our plaintiffs, finally giving them the justice they deserve after the horrific weekend of violence and intimidation in August 2017,"" plaintiffs' attorneys Roberta Kaplan and Karen Dunn said. ""Today's verdict sends a loud and clear message that facts matter, the law matters, and that the laws of this this country will not tolerate the use of violence to deprive racial and religious minorities of the basic right we all share to live as free and equal citizens.""One defense attorney called the verdict a win.""It's a politically charged situation. It's going to be hard to get 11 people to agree,"" said attorney Joshua Smith, who represented three defendants. ""I consider a hung jury to be a win, considering a disparity of resources.""The events surrounding August 11-12, 2017, saw White nationalists and supremacists marching through Charlottesville and the University of Virginia campus chanting, ""Jews will not replace us,"" ""You will not replace us"" and ""Blood and soil,"" a phrase evoking Nazi philosophy on ethnic identity. The violence -- which enveloped the rally to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee -- reached a crescendo when James Alex Fields Jr., who was protesting the statue's removal, sped his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Half of the $24 million in punitive damages awarded were against Fields. In addition, the jury awarded punitive damages against Kessler, Spencer and Cantwell at $700,000 each, and Heimbach for $500,000.Despite the large jury award, there's the question of whether the plaintiffs will see much of that money. Fields is serving multiple life sentences. Some of the other defendants -- individuals and White supremacist organizations -- have indicated they are financially stressed.""The defendants in the case are destitute, none of them have any money,"" Smith said. ""I don't know how any of the plaintiffs are going to get anything for any of this."" Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they intend to relitigate the two federal conspiracy charges.The first federal conspiracy claim was the most prominent against the defendants because it alleged the defendants conspired to commit racially motivated violence while the second alleged the defendants had knowledge of a conspiracy and failed to prevent it.""We intend to get a verdict on those counts in the future,"" Kaplan said.Amy Spitalnick, executive director for Integrity First for America, the group that funded the suit, called the multimillion dollar decision a message.""This verdict sends a very clear message that violent hate will not go unanswered,"" Spitalnick said. ""There will be very serious consequences for the sort of extremist violence we saw here four years ago. And that's incredibly powerful, particularly at a moment when we know that extremism is on the rise, when democracy is under threat, and when there has been so little accountability.""Millions in damages awardedA jury awarded the plaintiffs $11 million in punitive damages on a Virginia conspiracy claim. On that claim, each defendant is liable for $500,000 each. Five organizations are liable for $1 million each.The jury only awarded $7 to the plaintiffs in compensatory damages on the civil conspiracy claim.In general, compensatory damages compensate (or make whole) the injured party for their loss or injury. Punitive damages are considered punishment when the defendant's behavior is found to be particularly harmful, such as if the defendant intentionally engaged in willful misconduct.  For the claim that some defendants subjected plaintiffs to racial, religious or ethnic harassment, violence or vandalism, Kessler, Spencer, Cantwell, Elliott Kline and Robert ""Azzmador"" Ray were each found liable for punitive damages.Plaintiffs Natalie Romero and Devin Willis were awarded $250,000 each in compensatory damages.In the same claim, the jury also found Fields liable, but did not award any damages.It also found Fields liable for $12 million in punitive damages total for claims of assault or battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Jurors awarded $803,277 in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs for the assault or battery claim. On the other claim, the jury awarded $701,459 in compensatory damages.Fields didn't testify in the trial but was represented by an attorney.Lawsuit sought long-awaited consequencesA few criminal cases resulted from the events surrounding the rally -- including state and federal convictions of Fields, who is serving multiple life sentences for killing Heyer -- but there were no large-scale trials of organizers from the Justice Department under the Trump or Biden administrations.The civil lawsuit in federal court sought to impose consequences on those who planned the rally and Fields for the people he injured or traumatized when he ran his Dodge Challenger into the crowd. But even before the trial, the plaintiffs had won in some ways due to the national outrage over the violence. Richard Spencer stopped his public speaking tour and has called the case ""financially crippling."" Jeff Schoep and Heimbach renounced White supremacy and stopped organizing White power activity in public. Schoep gave the group he led for more than two decades, the National Socialist Movement, to a Black civil rights activist who died shortly thereafter. Identity Evropa, one of the groups named in the suit, rebranded under a new name twice before disbanding. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that even though the full verdict amounts likely won't be paid, the lawsuit will brings significant consequences. He compared the verdict with a decision in the 1980s in which a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center crippled the Ku Klux Klan.""It is a significant verdict,"" Toobin said of Tuesday's decision. ""It is important to realize as one of the defense attorneys said that these defendants don't have millions of dollars and they won't pay millions of dollars. But they will face consequences and they will face the prospect of having wages garnished, property taken.""Fourteen people and 10 White supremacist and nationalist organizations were originally named in the lawsuit that prompted the trial, but a few were not involved in the verdicts because they didn't show up for court and were the subjects of default judgments. In closing arguments last week, attorneys representing the plaintiffs told the jury that the defendants prepared for the ""Battle of Charlottesville"" and messages sent between them and their actions after the violence were proof of a conspiracy. Defense attorneys and Spence and Cantwell, represented themselves countered that none of the plaintiffs had proven the defendants had organized racial violence. The case was Sines v. Kessler.",2
170,"Berdyansk, Ukraine  (CNN)The Ukrainian naval patrol boat ""Kremenchuk"" churns out into the gun-grey waters of the Sea of Azov, one mounted machine gun pointing aft, another pointing fore into the drizzle.Commander Ivan Ovchar explains his ship's mission: ""To defend and maintain the sovereignty of Ukraine.""The threat, the officer and many of Ukraine's allies believe, comes from Russia.For weeks, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been expressing growing concern about Moscow's military activity on the Ukrainian border.""We don't know what President [Vladimir] Putin's intentions are, but we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said Saturday during a trip to Senegal, referring to Russian military incursions, acknowledged or not, into neighboring countries. ""We do know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and then using that as an excuse to do what Russia's planning to do all along.""The Kremlin has responded by accusing western countries of ""hysteria"" about Russia invading Ukraine.Strait jacketWith tensions high in the region, CNN joined the Ukrainian navy vessel departing from Berdyansk on Ukraine's Azov coastline. Usually, Commander Ovchar's crew comes across six or seven Russian coast guard patrol boats, he says, but on this mission, there were none.The sea he's patrolling borders Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow following a controversial referendum in 2014, in violation of international law.Since seizing Crimea, Russia has built a bridge linking it to its own territory. The Kerch Bridge over the Kerch Strait serves as the only direct connection between Russia and Crimea -- and gives Moscow de facto control of the sea's access to the Black Sea and Mediterranean beyond.But Ukraine has a plan to try to keep Moscow from taking complete control of the body of water that links Ukraine's two biggest ports, Berdyansk and Mariupol.Ukraine's new Defense Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced November 13 that the pace of building a new naval port in Berdyansk was to be increased. On Tuesday, CNN gained exclusive access to the ""Sehid"" or ""East"" base under construction.It was immediately clear that a lot of work still needed to be done for this base to be anywhere near completion.The aim was to complete the first phase of construction -- new living quarters, administrative buildings and a small medical facility on the site of a disused tin factory -- by the end of year. However, with less than six weeks to go, there was not even a roof on the main building.A special detachment of military builders toiled with masonry, slapping on cement and laying bricks, a Ukrainian flag billowing as they worked.The scale of the task at hand became even starker as we walked down onto the port, joined to a commercial port.""This will be the position of the docks,"" Capt. 2nd Class Alexander Serdiyk said, pointing to heaps of warped metal and boulders lying haphazardly in the sea. ""We plan to have this section completed in two years.""But Ukraine may not have two years to prepare for conflict.The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, Brigader General Kyrylo Budanov, told the US defense newspaper Military Times that Russia was increasing troop levels and weapons systems in Crimea for an offensive that could come at any time. The Kremlin has repeatedly said it has no plans to invade Ukraine. ""The American and Ukrainian media claim that Russia is preparing for an attack on Ukraine, and we are saying that Ukraine is planning hostilities against Donbas, against the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, said Tuesday. ""We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for an attempt to forcefully resolve the Donbas issue.""  Ukraine's allies have begun responding to what they see as a fresh threat from its neighbor to the east.On Monday, CNN reported that the Biden administration was weighing the possibility of sending military advisers and new equipment, including weaponry, to Ukraine. The package could include Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-armor missiles and mortars.The US is also considering sanctions with European allies if Russia invades Ukraine.Last week, British Defence Minister Ben Wallace visited Ukraine and signed an agreement to ""develop the capabilities of the naval forces of Ukraine."" CNN learned Tuesday that part of the deal will focus on Berdyansk.The same day, the Ukrainian navy announced the arrival of two ""Island-type"" boats named ""Fastiv"" and ""Sumy,"" delivered from Baltimore in the United States to Odessa in Ukraine.""Soon the boats will raise the Ukrainian navy flag and under the command of Ukrainian crews they will begin their combat journey to ensure maritime safety in the Black and Azov seas,"" Admiral Alexey Neizhpapa said.The bigger question is whether new Ukrainian ships and infrastructure, plus warnings from the West, will be enough of a deterrent.

171," (CNN)Many members within the House of Representatives have told CNN in recent days that they find themselves in a toxic work environment, wrought with bitter exchanges, threats and fears about what the erosion of decorum in the chamber will mean for a body that has still not recovered 10 months after the Capitol Hill riot.In interviews with more than a dozen members, CNN heard from Democrats and some Republicans who say things are as bad as they can remember, with no sign things will get better soon, and the fears and concerns aren't just coming from members, but their families as well.Last week alone, Democrats and two Republicans voted to censure Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican from Arizona, for posting an animé video depicting the killing of fellow member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York. Initially, Gosar took the video down, but he retweeted another tweet containing the video just an hour after he endured the highest form of rebuke a member can get in the House. As he took his punishment in the well of the House, he was surrounded by a group of colleagues rushing to his defense. His leadership never came to the floor to admonish him, only attacking the process Democrats were using. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado, defended Gosar on the floor by calling some of her progressive Democratic colleagues the ""Jihad squad,"" a term she defended to CNN on Friday. ""It is shocking to me that Leader McCarthy would stand for eight and a half hours spewing disinformation about a bill that is for the American people and yet not speak a word about the atrocity of his own member putting out a video that glorifies the murder of a colleague and threatens violence against the President of the United States,"" said Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania. ""I don't know where the next basement is.""It's all part of the challenge members are facing now in the House, and some have opted to retire rather than endure more caustic behavior. On the outskirts of the House chamber, metal detectors are still stationed at every door, a reminder of the fears that remain. And an effort to investigate the root cause of the attack on January 6 has been politicized and met with resistance by most Republicans. Some have even downplayed whether the events of that day were all that bad. It's a constant reminder for some members about the state of their workplace. ""January 6th made things so much worse. I was on the floor that day. That was a forever life-changing moment on a personal level, but it was also a moment that changed Congress,"" Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Illinois, told CNN. ""It started with the incessant lies that weren't challenged and were amplified to January 6th to a member of Congress threatening lives of friends and colleagues."" In an interview with Rep. John Garamendi, a Democrat from California, Garamendi's wife Patricia could be heard in the background during the interview responding along with her husband that yes, the threats were as bad as they had ever been. Patricia Garamendi, who works closely with other congressional spouses on events and provides guidance on how to navigate Congress, agreed to speak with CNN for the story. She said that it's the scariest time she can remember for the spouses of members who worry not just about their member of Congress, but their entire families.""It took away a lot of the fun. Service is hard. Travel is hard and the issues are hard, but when you are worried about your family, it has been difficult,"" she said. ""I mean some kids are being escorted to school."" 'I'm not running again'And those are just the security threats. A massive battle over Covid-19 has only exasperated the divisions. A handful of conservative members regularly defy the House speaker's mask mandate, racking up thousands of dollars in fines while some members publicly admit they aren't getting vaccinated. Standing on the steps of the US House Friday, Bustos told CNN that all of the bitterness and lies impacted her decision not to run for reelection. ""My interns are down there,"" she pointed. ""I always write them five pieces of advice and one of those is 'don't take things personally.' I've tried to live that in politics. This, you can't help but take personally. All of this has contributed to the fact that I'm not running again. I want to love what I do. I want to love who I work with. I want to respect the people I work with and that has been compromised in ways that I hope can be repaired at some point, but right now I do not feel like I can repair.""Some of the anxiety members feel stems from bitter disagreements with the opposite party, while others say the spiral of toxicity has metastasized even to how members within the same party engage with one another. For months, progressives and moderates in the Democratic party grappled with how to pass both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a Democrat-only bill to expand the social safety net. But the divisions within their ranks threatened both bills and resulted in sometimes public and pointed personal jabs.""Toxic is spot-on,"" Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from Florida, said. ""I think there is plenty of Dem-on-Dem violence as well as Republican and Democratic divisions. I think it is not conducive to a healthy legislative environment for colleagues to make these debates both so personal and caustic.""'People here need to get thicker skin'In a series of interviews with Republicans, many downplayed the divisions outright or blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for setting the wrong tone when she announced all members would need to walk through metal detectors to get to the House floor after the insurrection. ""I believe it is a consolidation of power in the Speaker's office in the House and an abuse of power by the Speaker because she has one-party control and she is completely shutting down the voices of the minority and hiding behind Covid to accomplish it,"" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers, a Republican from Washington state, told CNN. Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas who advocated ahead of January 6 to certify the electoral college results, told CNN that part of the problem is that members have not moved on from January 6th.""People here need to get thicker skin,"" Roy said. ""At some point here, you gotta let some things roll.""Asked if he was including the insurrection in the things that people needed to let ""roll,"" Roy said ""people here have got to get thicker skin about representing the people and doing their job and not making everything personal on the floor of the House.""'I feel safe, but it is incredibly concerning'But for some members, the threats are very personal. ""Congressman Boebert referred to us as the 'Jihad squad' on the House floor. What that does is it empowers and inspires people who want to do us harm, to actually go and do that harm. She is on the House floor spewing 'Jihad squad,' "" Rep. Jamaal Bowman said. ""I feel safe, but it is incredibly concerning that she is speaking this way and we have to respond to that in some way.""Ocasio-Cortez, who was the subject of Gosar's animé video, told CNN last week that sometimes it is impossible to separate the political from the personal, even as she has tried to build relationships with some Republicans. ""It is not just because they dislike me as a person. In fact, I have had many a Republican come to me on the House floor and say 'I tell folks back home that while I don't agree with you, I think you are a quite kind person.' I have had Republicans come up to me after the 6th, one of them even weeping and with guilt over what happened,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""So for some ... publicly, this is a performance. But it is also personal because I cannot separate myself from my gender, I cannot separate myself of how I was born, so their hatred of non-White people, their hatred of women is a hatred of me.""",2
172," (CNN)A NASA spacecraft that will deliberately crash into an asteroid is preparing to launch this week. Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.The DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, will lift off at 10:20 p.m. PT (1:20 a.m. ET) on November 23 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Live coverage of the event will air on NASA TV and the agency's site.But the true test for this asteroid deflection technology will come in September 2022, when the spacecraft reaches its destination, to see how it impacts the motion of a near-Earth asteroid in space.The mission target is Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting the near-Earth asteroid Didymos. This will be the agency's first full-scale demonstration of this type of technology on behalf of planetary defense. It also will be the first time humans have altered the dynamics of a solar system body in a measurable way, according to the European Space Agency. Near-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that place them within 30 million miles (48 million kilometers) of Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects, or NEOs, that could potentially cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.Asteroid Didymos and its moon DimorphosIn Greek, Didymos means ""twin,"" which is a nod to how the asteroid -- nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometer) across -- forms a binary system with the smaller asteroid, or moon -- 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter -- that was discovered two decades ago. Kleomenis Tsiganis, a planetary scientist at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and a member of the DART team, suggested that the moon be named Dimorphos, which means ""two forms.""It's the perfect time for the DART mission to occur. Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth -- within 6,835,083 miles (11 million kilometers) -- in September 2022. The spacecraft will come speeding in at about 15,000 miles (24,140 kilometers) per hour, targeting Dimorphos, said Nancy Chabot, DART coordination lead at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.A camera on the spacecraft, called DRACO, and autonomous navigation software will help the spacecraft detect and collide with Dimorphos. DRACO is short for Didymos Reconnaissance & Asteroid Camera for OpNav.The mission's aim is to deliberately crash into Dimorphos to change the asteroid's motion in space, according to NASA. This collision will be recorded by LICIACube, or Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids, a companion cube satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency. It's the Italian Space Agency's first deep space mission. The briefcase-size CubeSat will travel on DART and then be deployed from it prior to impact so it can record what happens. Three minutes after the impact, the CubeSat will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video.The video of the impact will be streamed back to Earth, which should be ""pretty exciting,"" said Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.""Astronomers will be able to compare observations from Earth-based telescopes before and after DART's kinetic impact to determine how much the orbital period of Dimorphos changed,"" said Tom Statler, DART program scientist at NASA Headquarters, in a statement. ""That's the key measurement that will tell us how the asteroid responded to our deflection effort.""A few years after the impact, the European Space Agency's Hera mission will conduct a follow-up investigation of Didymos and Dimorphos. While the DART mission was developed for NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office and managed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the mission team will work with the Hera mission team under an international collaboration known as the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment, or AIDA. ""DART is a first step in testing methods for hazardous asteroid deflection,"" said Andrea Riley, DART program executive at NASA Headquarters, in a statement. ""Potentially hazardous asteroids are a global concern, and we are excited to be working with our Italian and European colleagues to collect the most accurate data possible from this kinetic impact deflection demonstration.""A mission of firstsDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is relative to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth, but the double asteroid system itself is not a threat to Earth. The spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won't obliterate the asteroid.""This isn't going to destroy the asteroid, it's just going to give it a small nudge and deflect its path around the larger asteroid,"" Chabot said. This means there isn't a chance of changing the trajectory of the asteroid to make it more of a threat.The fast impact will only change Dimorphos' speed as it orbits Didymos by 1%, which doesn't sound like a lot -- but it will change the moon's orbital period by more than a minute. That change can be observed and measured from ground-based telescopes on Earth. Dimorphos completes an orbit around Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. If the impact is successful, it will change that period by at least 73 seconds, said Andy Cheng, DART investigation team lead at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.Measuring the momentum transfer between the spacecraft and Dimorphos will show how much is needed to change the course of an asteroid.""If one day an asteroid is discovered on a collision course with Earth, then we will have an idea how much momentum we need to make that asteroid miss the Earth,"" Cheng said. Planetary defense strategiesWhile there are currently no asteroids on a direct impact course with Earth, there is a large population of near-Earth asteroids -- more than 27,000 in all shapes and sizes.""The key to planetary defense is finding them well before they are an impact threat,"" said Lindley Johnson, planetary defense officer at NASA Headquarters. ""The principle with all of them is just to change the orbital speed of the asteroid just a small amount. Changing that speed of the asteroid in its orbit changes its orbit so in the future, it won't be in the same place it was going to be to impact the Earth.""Three years after the impact, Hera will arrive to study Dimorphos in detail, measuring physical properties of the moon, studying the DART impact and the moon's orbit. This may sound like a long time to wait between the impact and follow-up, but it's based on lessons learned in the past. In July 2005, NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft launched a 815-pound (370-kilogram) copper impact into a comet, Tempel 1. But the spacecraft was not able to see the crater that resulted because the impact released tons of dust and ice. However, NASA's Stardust mission in 2011 was able to characterize the impact -- a 492-foot (150-meter) gash.Together, the valuable data collected by DART and Hera will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially understanding what kind of force is needed to shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that may collide with our planet. After analyzing the results of the mission, ""this technique would be a part of a toolbox that we're starting to build of capabilities to deflect an asteroid,"" Johnson said.",2
173," (CNN)Brian Laundrie died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head, an attorney for the Laundrie family told CNN Tuesday.""Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide,"" said attorney Steven Bertolino. CNN has reached out to authorities for further comment, and has followed up with Bertolino regarding how Laundrie came to be in possession of a gun.Laundrie's remains were found in a Florida nature reserve last month after a weekslong manhunt. He disappeared just days after his fiancée Gabby Petito was reported missing.The couple had been traveling across the country over the summer in a converted van and documenting their travels on social media. The case gained national attention as authorities searched for both.Laundrie returned to his parents' house in Florida on September 1 without Petito. As police were trying to question the family about Petito's whereabouts, Laundrie went missing on September 13 or 14 after leaving home with a backpack, according to his parents. Petito's remains were found in Wyoming on September 19. Her death was ruled a homicide by manual strangulation.Petito's family says they are ""aware of the circumstances"" regarding Laundrie. But they are not making an official comment at the request of the US Attorney's Office and the Teton County Prosecutor's Office in Wyoming, according to a statement from the family.The family was asked not to make any comments while the investigation into her death is ongoing, the statement said.A Florida medical examiner's office confirmed Tuesday Laundrie had died of suicide by a gunshot wound to the head.The office won't make the autopsy report public ""until the law enforcement investigation is complete,"" the office said in a release.A timeline of the Petito caseWhat led to Petito's death remains a mystery. The FBI had described Laundrie as a ""person of interest"" in her murder, but he was not charged. He had, though, been indicted for allegedly using two accounts that belonged to someone else in the days after she died. Laundrie's remains were found October 20 in an area of Carlton Reserve that had been underwater during previous searches of the 25,000-acre nature reserve in North Port. Laundrie's father, who was searching with authorities the day his son's remains were found, discovered a notebook near where Laundrie's body was found. Experts said at the time the notebook could be key in providing answers. The notebook was wet at the time, and officials haven't yet said whether they have gained any information from it. Bertolini said in October Laundrie's parents had discussed ""several times"" the possibility their son had died by suicide. ",2
174," (CNN)The next presidential election is three years away. Recent reports about early concern over whether President Joe Biden will run for reelection in 2024 and about tension between potential 2024 rivals, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Vice President Kamala Harris are, to some extent, standard Washington gossip that can be safely ignored. Still, there may be something more than that.  Buttigieg is clearly very ambitious, ran an impressive presidential campaign in 2020 and has only strengthened his political skills since then. Harris, as the vice president, is a leading contender to be the face of the post-Joe Biden Democratic Party. Each may see the other as standing in their way as 2024 approaches. This is particularly important because the 79-year-old Biden, despite wisely sending signals that he will seek reelection in 2024, may decide that he doesn't want to run three years from now.If Biden does run, as an incumbent, he has an advantage. But if he chooses not to, that doesn't mean Democrats are doomed.A primary campaign between Harris and Buttigieg could pit two key Democratic constituencies against each other: African Americans, particularly African American women, and LGBTQ voters. The impact of that fight would be even worse if it began in 2023 and took over the second half of Biden's current term. Fortunately, this is a problem that can be easily solved without either politician having to give up anything lasting. Harris and Buttigieg instead could agree that, if Biden does not run again, they would run together in 2024, with Harris the nominee for president and Buttigieg for vice-president. This could put an end to whatever feuding exists between them now, while giving the Democratic Party a very strong ticket in 2024 that would seem like a natural continuation of Biden's first term. A Harris-Buttigieg ticket would showcase two dynamic politicians and represent the breadth and diversity of the Democratic Party, and indeed the whole country, while not veering too far left and alienating key swing voters who Biden won in 2020.This ticket would be balanced with regards to geography: Harris is unmistakably Californian while Buttigieg is from Indiana, and brings with him a deep understanding of the Midwest.  Harris would be 60 years old on Election Day 2024, while Buttigieg would be 42, so there would be generational balance there as well. Both nominees represent important Democratic Party constituencies -- Harris is an African American and Asian American woman, while Buttigieg is a gay man. This would help mobilize important parts of the Democratic base. However, both politicians are essentially moderates, so it would be hard for the Republican Party to effectively tar them as radicals, socialists or anything like that -- something they would undoubtedly try to do. During, and since, the 2020 election, the right wing has tried to paint Harris as being on the far left, but that attack never got much traction.A Harris-Buttigieg ticket would also have a fair amount of star power. Although Harris did very poorly when she ran for president in 2020, we have seen glimpses of what she can be,  including the first presidential debate of the primary season when she landed some very effective attacks on Biden. Later, during the vice-presidential debate, she more than held her own against a very polished Mike Pence. It's also visible in the easy and strong rapport she has with many voters. Buttigieg has shined in recent months, as well during the 2020 general election, due to his media skills, fast wit and sharp intellect.Not every faction of the Democratic coalition would be happy with this ticket. The left wing of the party has long viewed Buttigieg as too moderate and have been wary of Harris due to her work as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney general. These concerns are legitimate, but by the time they have served four years in the Biden's administration, what Harris did as DA almost 20 years earlier or as attorney general a decade ago will seem less relevant. Rather, the two will be seen as national leaders whose popularity will be tied to the Biden administration rather than anything they did before that. By taking the second spot on the ticket, Buttigieg would be putting his own presidential aspirations on hold, but he is so young that he would still have plenty of opportunities to run for president. One way to see this is that if Harris and Buttigieg ticket got elected in 2024 and reelected in 2028, Buttigieg would still be only 50 if he chose to run in 2032. Harris-Buttigieg could turn out to be a dream ticket for the Democrats while simultaneously avoiding a potentially damaging dynamic both within the administration and in a possible Democratic primary. However, a lot must happen between now and then to make it a reality. In addition to getting buy-in from both people directly involved, it is also important to avoid the appearance that a backroom deal is being made. This is something to which the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is particularly sensitive. The way to do this is to tamp down any speculation about a deal while at the same time bolstering Harris and making it clear to Buttigieg that the administration is not going to abandon the vice president in the face of media criticism. When Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, he indicated that she was the future of the Democratic Party. It is natural that other politicians who see themselves as that future might chafe at that. Nonetheless, regardless of how she is viewed by many now, Harris will be a strong frontrunner to succeed Biden. The best way to ensure victory for the party may not be a drawn-out effort to nominate another flawed candidate, but to put together a balanced ticket with two rising Democratic Party stars. ",2
175," (CNN)Jennifer Lawrence has revealed that she is ""nervous"" about returning to the spotlight after taking a step back when she felt ""everybody had gotten sick of me.""The Oscar winner spoke to Vanity Fair magazine for its December issue cover story in a wide-ranging interview, touching on the challenges of fame, a near-death experience, the trauma of having intimate photos leaked online and the gender pay gap.Lawrence, who is expecting a baby with husband Cooke Maroney, is due to make her return to the screen with Adam McKay's comedy ""Don't Look Up.""Speaking to Vanity Fair, the 31-year-old star said: ""I'm so nervous... I haven't spoken to the world in forever. And to come back now, when I have all of these new accessories added to my life that I obviously want to protect.""The interview touches on the movies Lawrence worked on before she took a step back from the spotlight, which included ""Passengers,"" ""Mother!"" ""Red Sparrow"" and ""Dark Phoenix.""""I was not pumping out the quality that I should have,"" she said. ""I just think everybody had gotten sick of me. I'd gotten sick of me.""Lawrence said she had started to think she couldn't do anything right.""If I walked a red carpet, it was, 'Why didn't she run?'... I think that I was people-pleasing for the majority of my life,"" she said.Now Lawrence is pregnant and, although she declined to talk about how she feels about becoming a mother, she did share her thoughts on protecting her child.""Every instinct in my body wants to protect their privacy for the rest of their lives, as much as I can. I don't want anyone to feel welcome into their existence. And I feel like that just starts with not including them in this part of my work,"" she said. In 2014, a hacker leaked nude photos of Lawrence and other female celebrities. The actress spoke about the impact this has had on her.""Anybody can go look at my naked body without my consent, any time of the day,"" she said. ""Somebody in France just published them. My trauma will exist forever.""She also recounted an experience from 2017 when a small private plane she was traveling on had to make a hard emergency landing after both of its engines failed.""Flying is horrific and I have to do it all the time,"" she said, explaining how she had started leaving ""little mental voicemails"" to her family as the plane hurtled towards the ground.Lawrence, previously named the world's highest-paid actress, also touched on the reported pay discrepancy between her and ""Don't Look Up"" co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. ""Look, Leo brings in more box office than I do. I'm extremely fortunate and happy with my deal.

176,"London (CNN Business)A British bank has adopted a four-day work week for all its employees without cutting pay, saying it's the largest UK company so far to make such a move. Atom Bank announced on Tuesday that it had also reduced the weekly hours of its 430 staff to 34 from 37.5 and expected most workers to take either Monday or Friday off. The change is voluntary and would mean staff working slightly longer days. The policy, which took effect on November 1, was introduced to support Atom's employees' ""mental and physical well-being,"" and improve productivity, the company said. The majority of its workers have switched to the new work week. ""A four-day week will provide our employees with more opportunities to pursue their passions, spend time with their families, and build a healthier work/life balance,"" Atom CEO Mark Mullen said in a statement.Mullen said that Atom's experience during the pandemic had ""exploded many of the myths of the modern workplace,"" including the need to work in an office. Atom launched in 2016 as a mobile bank. It offers savings accounts, business loans and mortgages via its app. Mullen told CNN Business that Atom did not trial the new schedule in smaller teams before implementing it.""Everyone had to do it in order for us to really truly understand whether it was going to work,"" he said.He added that, so far, he has not seen a drop in productivity or levels of customer service, but that it would ""take time for people to adjust.""""If you've just spent 20 years in one model and, all of a sudden, you're thrown into a new one, you wake up on a Friday morning you think 'what am I going to do with all this time?'"" Mullen said.Workers have long clamored for a greater work-life balance. Two studies in Iceland between 2015 and 2019 trialling a four-day work week at the same rate of pay found no corresponding drop in productivity among participants, and a dramatic increase in employee well-being. And as the pandemic pushed millions into remote work, calls for increased flexibility have only grown louder.  Elephant Ventures, a software and data engineering company in New York City, said it had permanently moved to a four-day work week after successfully testing it in August 2020.  Mullen said in a statement that the five-day work week, a relic of the 20th century, was ""no longer fit for purpose"" and he hoped that more companies would follow Atom's lead. ",2
177,"Rome (CNN)Rudy Guede, the only person to remain convicted over the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy, has been released from prison, his lawyer Fabrizio Ballarini told CNN on Tuesday.Kercher's body was found in the apartment she shared with roommate Amanda Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. The 21-year-old's throat had been slashed.Knox was arrested alongside her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. They, and Guede, were formally charged the following summer. All three were convicted, but Knox and Sollecito's convictions were overturned in 2015.Prosecutors argued that Kercher had been murdered after refusing to participate in a drug-fueled sex game played by Knox, Sollecito and Guede. Guede, originally from Ivory Coast, requested a separate fast-track trial, fearing that Knox and Sollecito had formed a pact against him. He was convicted of murder in October 2008, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. His sentence was reduced to 16 years on appeal in December 2009.Knox and Sollecito, who insisted they were away from the apartment on the night Kercher was killed, were found guilty of murder in December 2009; Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and Sollecito to 25. The verdicts marked the beginning of a lengthy legal saga for Knox and Sollecito.",2
178," (CNN)Steve Bannon turned the January 6 committee into a politicized spectacle but Alex Jones and Roger Stone could conjure a theater of the absurd out of the probe into one of the most jarring assaults on democracy in US history.The Infowars demagogue and the Nixonian self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" became the latest acolytes of ex-President Donald Trump to get hit by subpoenas by the House select committee on Monday.The move was another indication the panel is digging into the organization and funding of Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally, in which both men were allegedly involved, which mushroomed into the Capitol insurrection. Their testimony -- should they appear before the panel -- could shed light on the key question for the committee about whether the rally had a pre-ordained purpose to trigger an uprising designed to halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden's election win. The subpoenas underscored a fast-track strategy by a Democratic-led committee that is unlikely to survive if Republicans, who have long protected Trump, win the House in next year's midterm elections. The panel is working feverishly and has interviewed more than 200 witnesses, including many members of the Trump administration who came forward voluntarily.But given the penchant of Stone and Jones for histrionic legal fights, the committee is unlikely to expect quick cooperation. Past behavior is not always predictive, and Stone especially has just emerged from a costly legal fight after his conviction for lying to Congress in another Trump-related case, for which he was pardoned by the ex-President. But like Jones, he has a long record of using moments of accountability to stage political stunts and promote extremism.Stone said in a statement that he had ""no advance knowledge"" of the events at the Capitol on January 6 and that any claim or report alleging or implying he did was ""categorically false."" He later told CNN affiliate KOKI he would ""would probably assert my 5th Amendment right, decline to be interviewed.""The committee has also shown it is ready to hold recalcitrant witnesses to account, after the House cited Bannon, another longtime Trump political adviser like Stone, for criminal contempt. The Justice Department has initiated a prosecution. Like Bannon, neither Jones nor Stone appears to have a strong case to claim contacts with Trump are shielded by executive privilege since neither were serving as administration officials. But arguing the point in court could use time that the committee does not have given grim prospects for Democrats of keeping the House in 2022. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has a stronger claim to executive privilege, is locked in a standoff with the committee. He is refusing to testify but has not been cited for contempt.The reputations of Stone and Jones, who are both political bomb throwers who pushed the lie that Trump won the election, suggest that neither will be able to resist the notoriety of a public duel with the panel.""If you think Steve Bannon upped the drama queen value on responding to a charge of a misdemeanor, my guess is we ain't seen nothing yet,"" said Andrew McCabe, a former deputy director of the FBI who is now a senior CNN law enforcement analyst.But Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California -- a committee member who, as a law student worked in Congress on the Watergate scandal involving Stone's mentor, President Richard Nixon -- said that Stone and Jones had no option but to testify.""You don't lie to Congress or else you're going to fall into other trouble, criminal law trouble. They are characters, but they have to come in and tell the truth,"" she said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""Stone and Jones were not the only new witnesses targeted on Monday. The committee also sent subpoenas to Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, key players in the ""Stop the Steal"" movement, and Taylor Budowich, who currently serves as Trump's spokesman.A committee with a grave purpose A new round of exhibitionism by spotlight-hungry members of Trump's orbit will not disguise the critical purpose of the committee. Trump, after all, tried to use the powers of the presidency to violate the will of voters and to destroy democratic institutions based on a lie of a stolen 2020 election. And given that Trump could run again for the White House as an unmasked wanna-be autocrat, the panel's eventual findings could be vital reading for voters in 2024.The ex-President's selfish refusal to accept the will of voters was laid bare in a Washington court room on Monday. In a plea hearing for a Capitol riot defendant, federal Judge Reggie Walton compared Trump to former Vice President Al Gore after the Supreme Court decided the disputed 2000 election in George W. Bush's favor.""Al Gore had a better case to argue than Mr. Trump, but he was a man about what happened to him,"" Walton said. ""He accepted it and walked away.""In another stark reminder of the stakes for the committee, unsealed documents revealed an apparent threat to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from Mark Mazza of Indiana, who was charged with carrying a loaded firearm onto the Capitol grounds. Mazza told investigators that if he had reached the speaker's office on January 6, they'd ""be here for another reason.""Besides seeking testimony from officials and outside allies who were close to Trump and his campaign, the January 6 committee has been fighting him in court over his effort to assert executive privilege over memos, schedules, visitor logs and other documents related to the January 6 period. Lawyers for the House said in a court filing on Monday that the investigators needed the ex-President's private papers in order to consider legislation to prevent future repeats of the insurrection. ""Any inquiry that did not insist on examining Mr. Trump's documents and communications would be worse than useless—the equivalent of staging a production of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark,"" their filing said.Digging deep into 'Stop the Steal'Stone has rarely been far from controversy since Trump transformed American politics by launching his campaign in 2015. He was found guilty in November 2019 of lying to and obstructing Congress in a case that shed light on the extent of Trump's knowledge about the release of stolen Democratic emails in 2016 by Wikileaks. So he has already established his reputation as a witness who is unlikely to turn on the ex-President. In an unrelated tax case Monday, his attorneys argued he was being hounded over his support for Trump.""This case would never have been brought if it didn't involve Roger Stone,"" the filing said.The House select committee has previously issued several subpoenas to organizers of rallies in Washington, DC, on January 5 and 6 that preceded the insurrection. CNN has reported that the investigation has included questions about security forces at the rallies and those associated with Stone and others.Court records show prosecutors accused two members of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers of text messaging about providing security to Stone. An Oath Keeper who appeared to be protecting Stone on January 6 later joined an angry mob outside the Capitol, according to video and images reviewed by CNN and four sources who confirmed his identity.In its letter to Jones, the committee stated that he was denied a speaking spot at the January 6 rally but that his previous comments indicate he was designated to ""lead a march to the Capitol, where President Trump would meet the group."" The committee acknowledged that once at the Capitol, Jones told people ""not to be violent."" Trump never showed up on Capitol Hill.Jones' subpoena landed less than two months after he was found legally responsible in two lawsuits for damages caused by his false claim that the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 26 people including 20 young children died, was a hoax.Lofgren told CNN's Jim Acosta on ""The Situation Room"" that Stone had raised money for security for the ""Stop the Steal"" rally through his websites and that Jones had claimed to raise most of the cash needed to stage the January 6 event.There is nothing wrong with staging a political rally. Even Trump's lies about the election being stolen are protected free speech. But the committee appears to be trying to find out whether the Capitol riot was a direct mob reaction to those lies peddled by Trump at the rally or if the ex-President or those in his orbit specifically laid the groundwork for the protest turning into an insurrection.",2
179," (CNN)More than three months after he resigned in disgrace, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo exists in political limbo -- not completely written off as a spent force, but sidelined as the campaign to replace him heats up.Cuomo, who for a decade ran the Empire State and its Democratic Party apparatus, left his perch in August rather than face impeachment and removal from office following an inquiry by the state attorney general's office that found he sexually harassed multiple women and oversaw a toxic workplace. His departure capped a stunning fall from the national political stardom he achieved during the nightmarish first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Cuomo's handling of the crisis, lauded then, has since come under withering scrutiny. On Monday, the state assembly released a report of its own -- broader in scope than the attorney general's -- which concluded there was ""overwhelming evidence that the former Governor engaged in sexual harassment"" and that Cuomo and his senior staff were ""not fully transparent regarding the number of nursing home residents who died as a result of Covid-19."" The misleading data, the investigators said, was then used by Cuomo to burnish his image in a now infamous book, which was written and promoted with the help of government staffers, that initially stood to make him about $5 million.Cuomo has denied the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, said he did not intentionally misstate the nursing home death count and insisted the book deal and publication process followed ethical norms.  But 18 months on from Democrats semi-seriously chewing over his presidential prospects, Cuomo is now the subject of a criminal complaint in connection to one of the harassment allegations and grand plans for an easy election to a fourth term in office -- one more than his father, the late former Gov. Mario Cuomo -- have been replaced by a grittier calculus.Animating Cuomo's refusal to recede into retirement, or at least lay low in the aftermath of his resignation -- which was ultimately prompted by a state legislature that was poised to impeach, convict and remove him from office -- are twin struggles: to clear his name and, at the same time, make sure that New Yorkers do not forget it. 'I don't know that he is powerful, but I think he is feared'Today, Cuomo's public voice is mostly limited to his email list and Twitter account, a running feed of broadsides by his lawyer, Rita Glavin, and spokesman Rich Azzopardi against the investigation overseen by New York Attorney General Letitia James into Cuomo's alleged sexual misconduct. Cuomo frequently retweets sympathetic opinion articles, including a Newsday op-ed from September that described his downfall as an ""Albany coup d'état."" There's also a picture of the former governor and his dog, Captain, on a boat. For many in New York politics, from operatives to lawmakers, Cuomo's swapping of the executive chamber for an online echo chamber has been a welcome one -- and created a new dynamic they are keen to maintain.State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who represents a swing district in southern Brooklyn, described an ""era of good feelings"" on the Albany scene, with new Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul openly speaking about collaboration and partnerships with lawmakers who had largely been frozen out by the Cuomo team. But even in exile from the capitol, Cuomo casts a long shadow.""There's always the possibility of mischief and mayhem, especially with someone who is hellbent on retribution,"" Gounardes said, ""but I think that that will only get legs if we allow it to.""A Democratic consultant without ties to any of the gubernatorial campaigns underscored Cuomo's unique, if increasingly tenuous, hold on the party.""I don't know that he is powerful, but I think he is feared,"" she said. ""And there's power in that fear.""James' entry into the gubernatorial primary earlier this month, where she is widely regarded as Hochul's most formidable challenger, has been used by the former governor's small team as a means of seeking to undermine her office's report, which found that Cuomo had sexually harassed at least 11 women.Inside the campaigns, and in public comments on the trail, discussion of the former governor's future plans has been limited.  One Democratic operative who has spoken to multiple gubernatorial campaigns told CNN that Cuomo was a secondary issue in those discussions, with more tangible electoral issues -- like ""How is Brooklyn gonna go?"" -- taking up ""90% of the conversation.""""The one (Cuomo-related) variable that comes up is, 'What about the 18 million? Are we gonna see that 18 million? Are we going to see part of it? Where is that going to turn up?,'"" the operative said, referring to Cuomo's warchest. ""Because that's really the Cuomo question. He doesn't have a bully pulpit anymore. When he releases a statement, it gets less and less attention.""Azzopardi, Cuomo's spokesman, dismissed the chatter and insisted the former governor's only priority was to clear his name. ""Since the beginning of this ordeal, this has never been about politics for us it's been about getting to the truth,"" he said. ""There's a ton of idle speculation out there but we can't help it if we continue to occupy vital real estate in people's head.""A political comeback? One way for Cuomo to settle scores, re-enter political life in a more recognizable form and potentially raise even more money would be to launch a new campaign. Rumors about a potential bid for state attorney general, a job he held from 2007 to 2010, have been floating around for weeks. Though few are ready to fully dismiss the possibility, even some longtime Cuomo allies are doubtful.""When you're in a situation like (Cuomo's), I would imagine that you will continue to strive for not just relevance, but a role, and that's what he may want. Whether that's realistic at this time, or not, is something different,"" said Jay Jacobs, New York's state Democratic Party chairman. (Jacobs endorsed Hochul in October, when he said he last spoke to Cuomo.)There is also skepticism in some quarters over how deep Cuomo's pockets actually are -- or will be -- given his recent expenses.""I think he's got a lot less money than you and I think he has. Let's say he had 20 million or 19 million. He's now spent the last six months paying lawyers,"" said Chris Coffey, a New York political strategist and former co-campaign manager of Andrew Yang's mayoral bid. ""So I think he would be lucky to break double digits (millions), which is still a lot of money, but if you keep going at that rate, he's going to spend that money pretty quickly.""Monica Klein, a New York City-based progressive political consultant, said Cuomo's reliance on a barrage of alternately incendiary and inscrutable video and email statements underscored his difficult position.""This is a man who used his bully pulpit and the office of the governor to build and brandish his public image daily. Now, he can't rely on the constant coverage he once earned as the top state official,"" Klein said. ""There is no beat for 'former governor angrily tweeting from Westchester.'""Glavin on a livestream last week from Cuomo's website repeated a familiar series of accusations and demands, repeatedly expressing frustration that James had not engaged with the Cuomo team's public criticism or responded to its letters (before sending two more), and pointed to a recent New York Post report that amplified rumors about Cuomo's mulling a campaign as reason for James to recuse herself from further investigations into the former governor.""There's widespread speculation that the governor may run, may attempt a political comeback,"" Glavin said. ""I don't know what the answer to that is, but the very fact that there is speculation and people are talking about it, we have unnamed former advisors talking about it, means that it's in the head of anyone who's running for governor.""But the story cited by Glavin said ""several of Cuomo's confidants"" had been floating the idea, meaning she was effectively using a report fueled by allies of the former governor as fodder for attacking James. In a statement, James' office offered its sharpest rebuke to date, deriding the press conference as ""dramatics"" and ""faux outrage.""""To be clear, we stand by the report into multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Andrew Cuomo and, more importantly, we stand by the women who were brave enough to come forward and speak truth to power,"" a spokesperson said. ""If Andrew Cuomo didn't want to be accused of sexual harassment, he shouldn't have sexually harassed multiple women in the first place.""",2
180," (CNN)Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's willful manipulation of migrants, enabling their easy passage to and through his country toward the border of the European Union, is a classic assault on democracy by an autocrat who knows that any attempt to fight back risks undermining the bloc's sacred values.Lukashenko denies the condemnation made by the G7 group of the world's wealthiest democracies that he is orchestrating ""irregular migration"" in an ""aggressive and exploitative"" campaign -- just as he rejects the European Union's accusation that his re-election as president last year, his sixth consecutive five-year term, was a sham.Not for nothing is the aging autocrat known outside of Belarus as Europe's last dictator.For much of this month, the world watched as weary migrants, some with small children and mainly from the Middle East, were coaxed and coerced in freezing conditions to a forest border with the EU. Their rising anger at not being allowed to cross erupted at times as they hurled volleys of rocks at Polish border guards who eventually spewed water cannon fire back at them.In a revealing interview with CNN last week, Lukashenko's foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, exposed the psychology behind his boss's decision to launch a frontal attack on Europe's borders. ""Belarus has shown the dark side of the European democracy,"" he claimed.US President Joe Biden made it an early theme of his term in office, that democracy is under attack. ""We're at an inflection point,"" he told an audience in Germany in February. ""We must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That, in my view, is our galvanizing mission.""But how to deliver on that mission is something that has yet to be mastered. Biden promised a ""summit of democracies"" ""early"" in his presidency, it is due to take place next month, although details are sketchy.  Biden's leverage is waning among allies, due to diplomatic missteps such as the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan and the AUKUS security pact with Australia and the UK that marginalized France. Meanwhile, autocrats like Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin appear to be exploiting the opportunity to divide, discourage and sow dissent in the democracies closest to them, in Europe.When Belarusian foreign minister Makei told CNN that: ""Poland has violated all the possible international legal laws and democratic values,"" he turned logic on its head by ignoring Lukashenko's autocratic practices, such as what some governments condemned as the illegal ""hijacking"" of a commercial airliner that was diverted to Minsk, and arresting a Belarus opposition activist who was on board.Cynically crying wolf, while wilfully ignoring their own violations is a convenience that autocracies routinely use to cover their tracks. On the face of it, how can the EU that champions human rights turn its back on migrants, less still turn water cannons on them? Human Rights groups have criticized Poland for preventing journalists from having access to the border region, and for allegedly pushing migrants who had successfully made it across the razor wire fence back into Belarus.  It is the caring side of democracy, that values human rights and decency, that Biden and others fear autocracies exploit. At one point last week, Lukashenko's government proposed that Germany should take in 2,000 migrants and Belarus would handle the rest.According to Lukashenko's foreign minister, both his boss and Putin were pushing Merkel into some sort of deal. ""It was President Putin who tried to contribute to the settlement of this crisis. He had conversations with Chancellor Merkel, he had conversations with President Lukashenko and as a result of these conversations, the phone calls between Merkel and Lukashenko were organized.""Whatever the detail of those conversations, Merkel and her EU partners saw through the ruse and refused to play ball. Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer later said firmly: ""We will not take in refugees. We will not bow to the pressure and say: 'We are taking refugees into European countries,' because this would mean implementing the very basis of this perfidious strategy."" This, it turns out, is not ""the dark side of the European democracy,"" as Makei claims, but the EU's reality check on what it sees as Lukashenko's lies.But will that matter for Lukashenko and Putin? Of course not. They thrive in a hybrid of hubris and confusion where doubt replaces certainty, and besmirching democracy's moral purpose is a victory in and of itself.Exploiting democracyWhile the fabricated crisis has -- so far -- failed to divide the EU, little of what's happened is a waste for the two autocrats, in that it helps prop up their own illegitimate rule. For their home audiences, the whipped-up confection of half truths about alleged mistreatment by border guards and their water cannons is enough to mislead some people into believing that the other side is no better than them.Lukashenko is exploiting democracy's core value -- compassion -- by weaponizing migrant trauma to turn the EU's moral strength to vulnerability. Europe's real weakness, that he appears to assess, is not its physical borders but its principles. But the real pernicious injury of Lukashenko's ruses is inflicted on the heart of democracy itself. To fight off his assault on democracy, the EU is forced into taking a firm stand and rejecting the 2,000 migrants. It is logical, but only borderline moral. It stoops toward Lukashenko's level and treats those desperate people as pawns.It is this often complicated issue that Biden wants us to explore by illuminating what democracy has at stake in the fight ahead.Inside the European Union, the main effect of Lukashenko's machinations will be to risk raising the specter of migrants at the border even beyond the pre-existing vexing reality -- a situation that has already fueled populist nationalism.At his inaugural address Biden used the word democracy five times in his introduction, and 11 times during his whole speech. It was at the forefront of his mind as he spoke at the spot where, just two weeks earlier, the United States' first attempted coup had unfolded.  Looking out on Washington's flag-strewn Mall, his words broadcast into millions of living rooms and autocrats' offices around the world, Biden warned: ""We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile."" It has become even clearer since then that democracy's trials are far from over, both in the United States and around the world. Now, leaders must convert their well-meaning words into actions.",2
181," (CNN)After spending 43 years behind bars for a crime he said he didn't commit, a Missouri man's conviction has been set aside, according to a news release from Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker. Senior Judge James Welsh filed his ruling Tuesday morning to set aside the conviction of 62-year-old Kevin Strickland, who served 43 years at Western Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri, after he was convicted of one count of capital murder and two counts of second-degree murder in a triple homicide. He received a 50-year life sentence without the possibility for parole for a crime he maintained he wasn't involved in.Strickland, from a wheelchair, spoke shortly after he was released from jail Tuesday afternoon and said he's thankful for his attorneys and everyone who listened to him over the years while he maintained his innocence. All criminal counts against Strickland were dismissed. His release makes his confinement the longest wrongful imprisonment in Missouri history and one of the longest in the nation, according to The National Registry of Exonerations.""Still in disbelief,"" Strickland said. ""I didn't think this day would come.""Strickland said he found out the news of his release through a breaking news report that interrupted the soap opera he was watching.""To say we're extremely pleased and grateful is an understatement,"" Peters Baker said. ""This brings justice -- finally -- to a man who has tragically suffered so, so greatly as a result of this wrongful conviction."" Strickland testified during a three-day evidentiary hearing earlier this month -- which involved eyewitness testimony given under oath -- Strickland's legal team presented evidence and arguments to exonerate him.Four people were shot in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 25, 1978, resulting in three deaths, according to CNN affiliate KSHB. The only survivor of the crime, Cynthia Douglas, who died in 2015, testified in 1978 Strickland was at the scene of the triple murder.Douglas survived the shooting after sustaining a shotgun injury and told police Vincent Bell and Kiln Adkins were two of the perpetrators. But she did not identify Strickland, who she knew, at the scene until a day later, according to KSHB, after it was suggested to her Strickland's hair matched Douglas' description of the shooter. Douglas claimed her initial failure to identify him was due to the use of cognac and marijuana, according to KSHB.But over the past 30 years she said she made a mistake and falsely identified Strickland. According to KSHB, Douglas made efforts to free Strickland through the Midwest Innocence Project.The two assailants Douglas identified at the scene both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and each ended up serving about 10 years in prison for the crimes, according to Strickland's attorney, Robert Hoffman.""Most of us have heard the famous quotation that 'injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'"" Peters Baker said in an online statement posted in August. ""Kevin Strickland stands as our own example of what happens when a system set to be just, just gets it terribly wrong.""Strickland thanked the judge for reviewing all the ""non evidence"" against him and he appreciated the judge taking his time to listen and understand what really happened in 1978.Eventually Strickland said he wants to get involved in speaking and possibly influencing legislation, and added he has ideas on how to keep this from happening to someone else.A GoFundMe account has been set up by the Midwest Innocence Project to help him restart his life. They note the State of Missouri will provide no compensation for the time he spent in prison.In 2020, there were 129 exonerations nationwide. Defendants exonerated last year lost a total of 1,737 years behind bars, an average of 13.4 years per exoneration, according to a report from The National Registry of Exonerations. And 30% of wrongful convictions in the registry's database can be traced back to mistaken eyewitness identifications.",2
182," (CNN)At least 45 people, including 12 children, were killed when their bus crashed and erupted in flames in Bulgaria early Tuesday, authorities said. Authorities believe the bus was carrying a total of 52 passengers, most of whom were tourists from North Macedonia, when the incident occurred at around 3 a.m. local time Tuesday.The bus, which had a North Macedonian registration, was traveling on the Struma highway west of the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The bus driver was among the dead, according to Bulgarian National Television (BNT).After initially reporting 46 deaths, authorities later said it was unclear whether 45 or 46 people had died, BNT reported.Authorities said seven people -- two women and five men -- who were traveling in the back of the bus survived by breaking the windows to escape. They have been taken to Pirogov emergency hospital in Sofia and are in stable condition.Authorities added that identification of the dead would be difficult as the bodies were severely damaged by the fire, BNT reported. Bulgarian Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov, who visited the crash site, told reporters he saw bodies ""clustered inside"" and ""burnt to ash."" He said ""the picture is terrifying,"" adding ""I have never seen anything like this before."" The cause of the accident was unclear but the bus appeared to have hit a highway barrier either before or after it caught fire, Bulgarian officials said.Footage from Nova TV Bulgaria showed the charred remains of the bus on the side of the highway, with the mangled barrier wedged beneath the vehicle. Emergency responders were seen standing near fire trucks and a police van while an investigator in a white protective suit surveyed the scene taking photographs. Behind the vehicle, damage to the center divider was visible with debris strewn across both sides of the highway. Speaking alongside Rashkov, the director of Bulgaria's National Investigation Service, Borislav Sarafov, called the incident ""a huge tragedy"" and offered his condolences to the families of the victims. Sarafov said the bus was one of four belonging to a tourist company from North Macedonia that entered Bulgaria late Monday from Turkey, BNT reported. The bus was returning to Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, from Istanbul -- a journey of around 800 km (500 miles) -- when the accident occurred. At this stage in the investigation, Sarafov said officials were exploring two possible causes of the accident. ""One is a human error of the bus driver, the second is a sudden technical malfunction, which led to the accident,"" he said, according to BNT. BNT reported that Rashkov added: ""There is a guardrail here, which was simply taken away, which means that most likely for some reason the bus went to the right in the direction of travel and came into contact with the guardrail, which was simply destroyed. We heard all sorts of versions, including a fuel leak. I hope it will be clarified very soon and the colleagues from the investigation will do their job.""Authorities will also be investigating the stretch of highway where the accident occurred, which is prone to traffic incidents, according to BNT. 'Great grief'In front of the Ismail Qemali elementary school in Skopje, pupils cried after hearing news that five of their schoolmates, all from one family, had been killed, Reuters reported.""Ergin was my friend. He was a very good boy. Very nice. I am so sorry that they died,"" Blerim Bushi, 11, told Reuters.In Sofia, Adnan Yasharovski, 45, said his 16-year-old daughter Zuleikha called him to say she had survived the crash, and he traveled to see her in hospital.""She was crying. Her hands were burnt but otherwise fine,"" he told Reuters outside the hospital. ""She didn't say much, she was crying and she was in shock. I only saw her through the door as due to COVID, they did not let me into the room.""Some relatives gathered outside the Besa Trans agency in Skopje, whose Facebook page advertised twice-weekly trips to Istanbul, and which Yasharovski said ran the trip. The office was closed and its representatives could not be reached for comment.""This is a huge tragedy,"" North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev told reporters in Sofia and expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims. Zaev said the passengers were all from North Macedonia but appeared to include a Serbian citizen and a Belgian citizen. It was unclear whether the two were among the victims or injured.Zaev said he had spoken to one of the seven survivors who told him the passengers were sleeping when they were woken by the sound of an explosion.He said people sitting at the back of the bus were able to break a window and jump out.Zaev said the passengers were from various communities in North Macedonia, a country of 2 million that borders Bulgaria and is home to an ethnic Albanian minority.In Skopje, ethnic Albanian Osman, 31, told Reuters he had come to the office of the travel agency with his brother and sister seeking information about their parents.""We do not know if they were on the bus that crashed or not. We have no information about them. The agency is not answering the phone. Perhaps we will need to go to Bulgaria,"" he said.Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka said the passengers were from North Macedonia's ethnic Albanian community.""Great grief for the 45 lost lives of Albanians from Northern Macedonia during the tragic accident in Bulgaria,"" he said on Twitter.

183,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Ethiopian Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed has announced he will lead his country's soldiers on the front lines of the war against advancing rebel fighters, in the latest escalation of the year-long conflict between his government and rebel groups from the northern Tigray region. ""Starting tomorrow, I will head to the war front to lead the defense forces in person,"" he wrote in a statement on Twitter late Monday, urging citizens to ""lead the country with a sacrifice"" and join him. ""Those of you who aim to be one of Ethiopia's children who will be celebrated in history, rise up today for your country, let's meet at the war front.""""In the past and in the present, the needs and lives of each and every one of us is below [the needs of] Ethiopia,"" Abiy added. ""We would rather die to save Ethiopia than outlive Ethiopia.""Abiy referred to the push as the ""final fight to save Ethiopia"" from ""internal and external enemies"" who he claims are ""ready to build their strength on the weakness of Ethiopia.""   The statement comes after the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) -- the former ruling party of Tigray -- claimed its fighters had captured two towns as they advance towards the capital Addis Ababa, more than one year after the conflict erupted in the north of the country. The TPLF, which ruled the country for more than three decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, has been designated a terrorist group by the current government.One of the towns TPLF claims was captured on Saturday includes Shewa Robit, which is about 220 km (136 miles) northeast of Addis Ababa. CNN has not been able to reach the federal government for comment on the claim. TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda responded to Abiy's statement in a tweet, warning that ""our forces won't relent on their inexorable advance towards bringing his chokehold on our people to an end."" While the Prime Minister is on the battlefield, his duties and the duties of other administrators who have joined the fight will be done by federal and regional officials who will ""work to their fullest capacity"" to oversee the development and administration of the country. ""Ethiopia is the name of winners,"" Abiy concluded his statement, "" I never doubt that my generation shall pay the price in its name as an icon of freedom."" When Abiy received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for ending a 20-year war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, he was lauded as a regional peacemaker. Now, he is presiding over a protracted civil war with rebels in Tigray that by many accounts bears the hallmarks of genocide.In November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in the northern Tigray region and promised that the conflict would be resolved quickly. One year on, the fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people from their homes, fueled famine and given rise to a wave of atrocities.Awol Allo, an associate professor of law at Keele University in the UK who was among those nominated Abiy for the Peace Prize, wrote of his shock over the Prime Minister's statement on joining the front lines. ""The announcement is replete with languages of martyrdom and sacrifice. This is so extraordinary and unprecedented, it shows how desperate the situation is,"" he tweeted on Monday. Abiy has repeatedly used inflammatory language while urging supporters to rise up against Tigrayan forces. In late October, Facebook removed a post by Abiy that violated the company's policies on inciting violence.  ",2
184," (CNN Business)Apple on Tuesday sued NSO Group and its parent company, accusing the Israeli firm of violating a federal anti-hacking law by selling potent software that clients have used to spy on Apple customers. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, alleges that NSO's spyware, known as Pegasus, and other malware have caused Apple monetary and property damages, and violated the human rights of Apple users along the way. ""To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,"" Apple said in a statement. In a statement Tuesday, NSO Group did not address the specifics of the lawsuit and instead said the firm's technology saves lives.NSO Group provides ""lawful tools"" to help governments fight pedophiles and terrorists, the firm said.While NSO Group has long maintained that it only sells its software to authorized users for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes, researchers have for years uncovered evidence that Pegasus has been used to surveil dissidents and human rights activists. Researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September said that an unidentified party was using Pegasus, and a vulnerability in Apple operating software, to spy on a Saudi activist. The lawsuit is the latest setback for NSO Group, which cybersecurity analysts and human rights activists have long accused of doing business with repressive governments. The firm's easy-to-use spyware is capable of eavesdropping on a phone's communications and accessing other sensitive data on the device, according to researchers. The US Commerce Department this month added NSO Group to its so-called ""entity list,"" effectively banning the company from buying software components from US vendors without a license. Commerce accused NSO Group, and another Israeli firm known as Candiru, of providing spyware to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target"" journalists, embassy workers and activists.In a statement at the time, NSO Group said it was ""dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed.""""We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world's most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based [on] the American values we deeply share,"" according to the statement, ""which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts [sic] with government agencies that misused our products.""Candiru could not be reached for comment at the time.Apple is at least the second major US tech firm to sue NSO Group. Facebook (now known as Meta) in 2019 sued NSO Group for allegedly facilitating the breach of 1,400 phones running the WhatsApp messaging application. NSO Group has denied the allegations made by Facebook, and tried to block the case from moving forward. But a US appeals court this month ruled that the lawsuit could proceed.Apple said it would contribute $10 million, plus any damages from the lawsuit, to ""organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.""The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages from NSO Group, as well as ""compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.""NSO Group is just one of several firms that sell specialized hacking tools to break into different types of mobile phones.  In its lawsuit, Apple's lawyers reflected on what it called a ""continual arms race"" between Apple engineers and NSO Group's code-writers.""Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades,"" the complaint states.",2
185," (CNN)A daughter of slain Black civil rights activist Malcolm X, Malikah Shabazz, died Monday, the New York Police Department told CNN.Shabazz, 56, was found unconscious by her daughter at her home in Brooklyn, according to the NYPD.Police said the death appeared to be due to natural causes. The ""cause of death is pending the final results of additional testing, but the death does not appear to be suspicious following initial review,"" a spokesperson for New York City's chief medical examiner's office, Julie Bolcer, said.Bernice King, a daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr., offered her condolences.""I'm deeply saddened by the death of #MalikahShabazz. My heart goes out to her family, the descendants of Dr. Betty Shabazz and Malcolm X. Dr. Shabazz was pregnant with Malikah and her twin sister, Malaak, when Brother Malcolm was assassinated. Be at peace, Malikah,"" King said on Twitter.Shabazz is the youngest of Malcolm X's six daughters.CNN has reached out to the medical examiner's office and to the Shabazz family.Malcolm X was one of the most powerful voices in the fight against racism before his shooting death in New York in 1965.He remains a symbol of inspiration for Black men and others moved by his transformation from a street hustler to a historic figure the late African-American actor Ossie Davis eulogized as ""our own black shining prince.""The assassination came after a public feud between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam's founder, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm X had accused Muhammad of infidelity and left the Nation in March of 1964.Last Thursday, two men convicted of the assassination were exonerated during a court hearing.New York County Supreme Court Administrative Judge Ellen Biben granted the motion to vacate the convictions of Muhammad A. Aziz and the late Khalil Islam.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also offered his condolences Tuesday for the death of Shabazz.""This family has been through hell over and over again. ... I'm so sorry for (what) they're going through right now,"" de Blasio said.",2
186,"New York (CNN Business)Perhaps one of the greatest mysteries of Thanksgiving is the cranberry sauce — and we're not talking about why people eat it: Why are the labels on Ocean Spray cans upside down?Observant consumers have noticed that the labels on jellied cranberry sauce cans are flipped, meaning the rounded edge that's typically on the bottom of most canned goods is on top of Ocean Spray cranberry sauce cans. According to Ocean Spray, that's intentional: It creates a seamless serving experience. The cans are ""filled and labeled upside down with the rounded edge on top and the sharp can-like edge on the bottom to keep the jelly whole,"" an Ocean Spray spokesperson told CNN Business. That creates an air bubble on the rounded side (a.k.a. the top) so customers can ""can swipe the edge of the can with a knife to break the vacuum and the log will easily slide out.""This process has been in use since the early 2000s. Adweek, which recently reported this important can caveat, noted that about 67 million cans are sold between Thanksgiving and Christmas. But like other Thanksgiving meal staples, canned cranberry sauce might be hard to come by. The sauce has 79% availability across national retailers,  which is down from 89% in that same period, according to IRI, a market research firm that tracks US retail sales.Ocean Spray, a farmer co-operative that makes cranberry sauce and sells bagged cranberries, said that ""consumers may experience some availability issues at times on a variety of cranberry products,"" because of supply chain issues. The co-op noted that it doesn't expect ""significant impacts"" on the availability of its products.-- CNN Business' Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.",2

188," (CNN)Mammoths are long to be known as ancient land dwellers, so scientists were shocked to find remains from the animal at the bottom of the ocean. Pilot Randy Prickett and scientist Steven Haddock, researchers with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), discovered a Columbian mammoth tusk 185 miles offshore and 10,000 feet deep in the ocean in 2019, the institution said in a news release.At the time they were only able to collect a small piece of the tusk, so they returned in July 2021 to get the complete sample. ""You start to 'expect the unexpected' when exploring the deep sea, but I'm still stunned that we came upon the ancient tusk of a mammoth,"" said Haddock. ""Our work examining this exciting discovery is just beginning and we look forward to sharing more information in the future.""University of Michigan paleontologist Daniel Fisher, who specializes in the study of mammoths and mastodons, said it is unlike anything he has ever seen. ""Other mammoths have been retrieved from the ocean, but generally not from depths of more than a few tens of meters,"" Fisher said. A variety of research facilities are examining the tusk to determine a variety of information about it including the age of the animal at its death, the release said. The researchers said the cold, high pressure environment helped to preserve the tusk, so it can be studied in greater detail. The scientists believe it could be the oldest well-preserved mammoth tusk recovered from this region of North America, and the UCSC Geochronology Lab estimates it is more than 100,000 years old after analyzing the radioisotopes. Researchers hope the data collected can not only tell them more about the mammoth they found, but the species in general. ""Specimens like this present a rare opportunity to paint a picture both of an animal that used to be alive and of the environment in which it lived,"" said Beth Shapiro, lead researcher at the UCSC Paleogenomics Lab.""Mammoth remains from continental North America are particularly rare, and so we expect that DNA from this tusk will go far to refine what we know about mammoths in this part of the world.""",2
189," (CNN)An ancient human relative was able to walk the ground on two legs and use their upper limbs to climb and swing like apes, according to a new study of 2 million-year-old vertebrae fossils. An international team of scientists from New York University, the University of the Witwatersrand and 15 other institutions studied lower back bones found in 2015 that belonged to a female Australopithecus sediba, a type of ancient hominid.Together with previously discovered bones from the same individual -- nicknamed ""Issa,"" which is Swahili for protector  --  the fossilized remains form one of the most complete lower backs ever discovered in the early hominid record and give an indication as to how this human relative would have moved through the world.The researchers said the newly studied lower back fossils were a missing link that proved early hominins used their upper limbs to climb like apes, and their lower limbs to walk like humans.The fossils were first discovered in 2015 during excavations of a mining trackway running next to the site of Malapa in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, near Johannesburg. They were then virtually prepared -- to avoid the risk of damage -- and reunited with fossils recovered during earlier work at the site and found to articulate with the spine of the fossil skeleton, part of the original specimens of Australopithecus sediba first described in 2010.The discovery also established that like humans, sediba had only five lumbar vertebrae.  ""While Issa was already one of the most complete skeletons of an ancient hominin ever discovered, these vertebrae practically complete the lower back and make Issa's lumbar region a contender for not only the best-preserved hominin lower back ever discovered, but also probably the best preserved,"" said Professor Lee Berger,  an author on the study and leader of the Malapa project.The excellent preservation of Issa helped to show that curvature of sediba's spine was more extreme than any other Australopithecus yet discovered -- that kind of spine curvature is typically seen in modern humans and demonstrates strong adaptations to bipedalism. ""While the presence of lordosis (the inward curve of the lumbar spine) and other features of the spine represent clear adaptations to walking on two legs, there are other features, such as the large and upward oriented transverse processes, that suggest powerful trunk musculature, perhaps for arboreal behaviors,"" said Professor Gabrielle Russo of Stony Brook University, another author on the study.Arboreal behaviors refer to climbing and living in trees.""The spine ties this all together,"" added study author Professor Thomas Cody Prang of Texas A&M University, who studies how ancient hominins walked and climbed. ""In what manner these combinations of traits persisted in our ancient ancestors, including potential adaptations to both walking on the ground on two legs and climbing trees effectively, is perhaps one of the major outstanding questions in human origins.""The study concluded that Australopithecus sediba was a transitional form of ancient human relative and its spine is clearly intermediate in shape between those of modern humans and great apes -- meaning that the species would have possessed both human and ape-like traits in its movements.The study was published Tuesday in the journal e-Life.",2
190," (CNN)Sandra Bullock has shared the big screen with Keanu Reeves twice -- but she's down for a third and even has an idea. Speaking to Esquire magazine for a profile on her ""Speed"" co-star, Bullock said she'd ""love nothing more than to do a comedy with Keanu before we both die."" (Grim, but OK.) ""He's funny. We can be seventy-five—it'll be even better then, like an old-people 'Cocoon' thing,"" she told the publication. ""We play two funny old people. A road trip. Just put us in an RV as old people. It'll be the bookend of 'Speed'! We'll just be driving really slowly. Pissing the world off.

(In 2006, they'd star together again in ""The Lake House."") Though they were never romantically involved, she said, Reeves was and remains and uniquely thoughtful person. She told one story about offhandedly mentioning in a conversation with Reeves that'd she'd never had Champagne and truffles, only to have him show up at her door days later with flowers, Champagne and truffles. ""That's what I mean that it drives you crazy,"" Bullock told the magazine. ""When I first met him, I would spend as much time as I could filling a silence, just to feel comfortable. And the more I jibber-jabbered on, the quieter he would get. And I thought, I don't understand what's happening! He's looking at me with eyes of confusion. He's quiet. Did I say something to offend him? And then a day or two later, he would arrive with a note or a little package, saying, 'I thought about what you said.' And he would have his response.""She added: ""How many people do you know like that?""One, Sandra. And the Internet would say, he's breathtaking. ",2

192,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Xiaomi stumbled in the third quarter as it grappled with fallout from the global chip shortage and fiercer competition.  The Chinese company, which only recently became the world's second-biggest smartphone maker, fell back to third place behind Apple (AAPL) in the three months ended September, according to Counterpoint Research and Canalys.Posting earnings on Tuesday, Xiaomi said that its smartphone business had been severely affected by the ongoing shortage of semiconductors, which it expects to continue through the first half of next year.""This year, there is a very special background, and that is there is a shortage of components globally,"" Wang Xiang, Xiaomi's president, said on an earnings call. ""The shortage is a big challenge to us.""The company logged 43.9 million global smartphone shipments in the third quarter of 2021, down about 6% compared with the same period last year.Xiaomi has called smartphones ""the cornerstone"" of its business, which includes other connected devices such as home appliances. Lately, the company has also announced a push into electric cars, with plans to mass produce its first vehicle in the first half of 2024. It excited investors this summer after leapfrogging Apple to become the world's second best-selling manufacturer. The Beijing-based company's shipments had soared in the three months ended June, trailing only those of Samsung (SSNLF). Setbacks on supplySince then, however, Xiaomi has been hit hard by supply chain woes.Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint, said that while component shortages had affected virtually every vendor, Xiaomi had to contend with bigger headaches due to its extensive lineup.In the most recent quarter, the company offered more than 50 different smartphone models, compared to about 14 that Apple had on the market, he estimated. That adds complexity and ""becomes challenging,"" said Pathak. ""Because you have to deal with a range of components.""A relative lack of exposure to the problem helped Apple, in part, reclaim the second spot in the race in the third quarter, he added. The US giant also benefited from strong iPhone 13 sales, according to Canalys Research. In a recent report, the firm estimated that Apple had nabbed 15% of global shipments, just one percent more than Xiaomi.But don't count Xiaomi out, according to Pathak.He said the firm could well reclaim its runner-up position, particularly as it usually performs strongly in the first half of the year, with upcoming events such as Chinese New Year.Xiaomi's ultimate goal — of eventually getting to number one — isn't out of the question either, according to Pathak.He said the company would need to retain its lead in two of its most important markets, China and India, while working to carve out a greater presence in places such as the United States. ""If they [become] number one, it can't be just because of these two countries,"" Pathak said. ""The US has the number three [smartphone] market in the world, which is largely missing from Xiaomi's portfolio.""Xiaomi posted overall revenue of 78.1 billion yuan ($12.2 billion) in the third quarter. That represented an 8% increase compared to the same time last year, but was slightly less than analysts were expecting. Net profit climbed 25% to nearly 5.2 billion yuan ($814 million) during that period, slightly higher than analyst projections.",2

196,"London (CNN)People in the United Kingdom think that climate change, pollution and the environment are together the most important issues they face, well ahead of the pandemic, the impacts of Brexit and the country's troubled National Health Service, according to a poll from Ipsos MORI published on Wednesday.The poll showed the highest level of concern about the climate crisis since the agency began polling in 1988. Ipsos MORI publishes its poll monthly, and November's was carried out over a week during the COP26 climate conference. The event was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and received extensive national media coverage. Around 40% of people surveyed said climate change, pollution and the environment were among their top three concerns. The pandemic came second at 27% and Brexit was third, with 22%. Ipsos MORI interviewed more than 1,000 adults, who answered spontaneously and were not prompted with options as answers. Climate concern was 16 percentage points higher in November than October, when people expressed greater concern about Brexit, the pandemic and the economy. While there was a clear bump in interest during the COP26 conference, there has been longterm growth in concern about climate over the past decade, which has been confirmed by other polls, including from YouGov. The Ipsos MORI poll showed was a fairly even distribution of climate concern across age groups, genders and political affiliation.""[It's] very encouraging that climate change is no longer a preoccupation reserved to the young and the liberal,"" Gabriela Jiga-Boy, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Swansea, told CNN. ""It means that British society may not be very divided regarding climate change. This is very important in these times, when we discuss a lot about real or false polarization on issues, and we often exaggerate how polarized people actually are.""Climate a top concern for older people, tooMen and women considered the climate crisis a top issue almost equally, at 40% and 41%, respectively, the poll showed. And supporters of the center-right Conservative Party and center-left Labour Party were equal in their concern for climate issues.In the age group of 55 and over, 47% of people said it was a top issue. For the 35 to 54 age group, it was 43%. Among those 18 to 34 years old, just 27% said the same, though that age group was less likely to say they were worried about any particular issue.Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said that climate change is now a top priority among a majority of groups because the topic is ""becoming personal."" That's also true for how policies like net-zero emissions targets may affect them.Dozens of countries have set a net-zero emissions goal for mid-century, for which they plan to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions and ""capture"" excess, through actions like planing trees or using technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels. Such technology isn't fully developed and remains controversial.  ""We are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change -- from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy,"" Hiteva told CNN in an email.While concern about the climate crisis is fairly even among age groups, support for different types of climate action is more divisive.""Older people are more inclined to pay for investment in infrastructure to improve the experience of future generations, while people between the age of 18-25 are significantly less inclined to pay more for improvements that they will not experience in their lifetime,"" she said, citing her own research on climate action.""The only way for this to translate into action is to use the momentum of the moment and engage people with re-imagining how infrastructure investment can be designed and used in an innovative way which is not only kinder to the environment but is also more inclusive and fairer.""",2
197," (CNN)Human Rights Watch (HRW) has accused the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of sportswashing serious human rights violations in the case of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai.During a virtual press conference Tuesday, HRW China Director Sophie Richardson denounced the IOC's role in collaborating with Chinese authorities on Peng Shuai's reappearance.""In 2008 we were hopeful that they [the IOC] would show some spine and oblige Chinese authorities to live up to some basic promises,"" said Richardson, referring to when China first staged the Olympic Games.""I almost think fondly back to those days because, if nothing else, the IOC has shown in the last few days just how desperate it is to keep a Games on the rails no matter the human cost,"" added Richardson, referring to next year's Beijing Winter Olympics. Beijing is the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games.On Sunday, the IOC said in a statement that its president, Thomas Bach, had a 30-minute video call with three-time Olympian Peng Shuai, joined by a Chinese sports official and an IOC official.The statement said that, during the call, Peng appeared to be ""doing fine"" and ""relaxed,"" and said she ""would like to have her privacy respected."" The IOC did not explain how the video call with Peng had been organized.'Big surprise'HRW also suggested the IOC should have done more to protect the Chinese Olympian athlete.""it's a whole different order of magnitude to see Thomas Bach, in a photograph with a woman, Peng Shuai, under intense pressure, we can reasonably assume from other cases, to walk back her claims of sexual assault, rather than figuring doing everything in his and the organization's power to call that out and make sure that she is afforded the support and investigation and prosecution that may well be warranted,"" Richardson said.In response, the IOC told CNN that the ""Olympic Games are the only event that brings the entire world together in peaceful competition."" ""They are the most powerful symbol of unity in all our diversity that the world knows,"" said the IOC statement.""In our fragile world, the power of sport to bring the whole world together, despite all the existing differences, gives us all hope for a better future.""Given the diverse participation in the Olympic Games, the IOC must remain neutral on all global political issues.""At all times, the IOC recognises and upholds human rights as enshrined in both the Fundamental Principles of the Olympic Charter and in its Code of Ethics. ""We are responsible for ensuring the respect of the Olympic Charter with regard to the Olympic Games and take this responsibility very seriously.""All interested parties have to provide assurances that the principles of the Olympic Charter will be respected in the context of the Games, and both the Japanese and Chinese organisers have done so for the recent Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 and upcoming Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.""Ability to report in ChinaConcerns were raised during the HRW press conference regarding the ability to report in China and how that could impact Peng's ongoing situation.""It is very hard to report on what is happening in China,"" the Director of Global Initiatives for Human Rights Watch, Minky Worden, said.""Chinese officials are blocking not just a United Nations backed investigation into human rights violations, but also the journalists the world relies on to reveal new abuses. ""So, it was a big surprise on Sunday to see the International Olympic Committee president and senior officials interview Chinese three time Olympian and former world number one doubles tennis player Peng Shuai by video,"" Worden added.Peng, 35, went missing on November 2 after she said on Chinese social media that she had been sexually assaulted and forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang Gaoli, 75, who was China's vice premier from 2013 to 2018.The allegations were censored in mainland China. CNN's broadcast signal was also censored during Peng reporting.Earlier on Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the government hoped ""malicious speculation"" about Peng's well-being and whereabouts would stop, and that her case should not be politicized.Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, declined to comment on whether the Chinese government will launch an investigation into Peng's sexual assault allegations against former Vice Premier Zhang. He repeated previous comments made to reporters, saying Peng's situation ""was not a diplomatic issue.""Peng, a two-time grand slam doubles champion and one of China's top tennis players, publicly accused Zhang of coercing her into sex at his home, according to screenshots of a since-deleted social media post dated November 2.Her disappearance from public life for more than two weeks following the accusation prompted an outpouring of international concern, with the Women's Tennis Association and the United Nations calling for an investigation into her allegations of sexual assault.",2
198,"Seoul, South KoreaFormer South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, whose iron-fisted rule of the country following a 1979 military coup sparked massive democracy protests, died on Tuesday at the age of 90, his former press aide said.Chun had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer which was in remission, and his health had deteriorated recently, his former press secretary Min Chung-ki told reporters. He died at his Seoul home early in the morning and his body will be moved to a hospital for a funeral later in the day.A former military commander, Chun presided over the 1980 Gwangju army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators, a crime for which he was later convicted and received a commuted death sentence.His death came about a month after another former President and his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, who played a crucial but controversial role in the country's troubled transition to democracy, died at age 88.An aloof, ramrod-straight Chun during his mid-1990s trial defended the coup as necessary to save the nation from a political crisis and denied sending troops into Gwangju.""I am sure that I would take the same action, if the same situation arose,"" Chun told the court.Chun was born on March 6, 1931, in Yulgok-myeon, a poor farming town in the southeastern county of Hapcheon, during Japanese rule over Korea.He joined the military straight out of high school, working his way up the ranks until he was appointed a commander in 1979. Taking charge of the investigation into the assassination of President Park Chung-hee that year, Chun courted key military allies and gained control of South Korea's intelligence agencies to headline a December 12 coup.""In front of the most powerful organizations under the Park Chung-hee presidency, it surprised me how easily (Chun) gained control over them and how skilfully he took advantage of the circumstances. In an instant he seemed to have grown into a giant,"" Park Jun-kwang, Chun's subordinate during the coup later told journalist Cho Gab-je.Chun's eight-year rule in the presidential Blue House was characterized by brutality and political repression. It was, however, also marked by growing economic prosperity.Chun resigned from office amid a nationwide student-led democratic movement in 1987 demanding a direct electoral system.In 1995, he was charged with mutiny, treason and was arrested after refusing to appear at the prosecutors' office and fleeing to his hometown.At what local media dubbed the ""trial of the century"", he and coup co-conspirator and succeeding President Roh Tae-Woo were found guilty of mutiny, treason and bribery. In their verdict, judges said Chun's rise to power came ""through illegal means which inflicted enormous damage on the people.""Thousands of students were believed to have been killed at Gwangju, according to testimonies by survivors, former military officers and investigators.Roh was given a lengthy jail term while Chun was sentenced to death. However, that was commuted by the Seoul High Court in recognition of Chun's role in the fast-paced economic development of the Asian ""Tiger"" economy and the peaceful transfer of the presidency to Roh in 1988.Both men were pardoned and freed from jail in 1997 by President Kim Young-sam, in what he called an effort to promote ""national unity.""Chun made several returns to the spotlight. He caused a national furore in 2003 when he claimed total assets of 291,000 won ($245) of cash, two dogs and some home appliances -- while owing some 220.5 billion won in fines. His four children and other relatives were later found to own large swaths of land in Seoul and luxurious villas in the United States.Chun's family in 2013 vowed to pay off the bulk of his debt, but his unpaid fines still totaled some 100 billion won as of December 2020.In 2020, Chun was found guilty and received an eight-month suspended sentence for defaming a late democracy activist and Catholic priest in his 2017 memoirs. Prosecutors have appealed, and Chun had faced a trial next week.",2

200," (CNN)Having endured a bloody civil war from 1983 until 2009, Sri Lanka is now at peace and developing rapidly. That's good news for the country as a whole, but the island nation's leopards are under threat. Sri Lankan conservationist Anjali Watson says that as forests where leopards live are cleared to plant crops and build homes, the big cats are being squeezed into pockets of wilderness that don't connect with each other. ""We've lost a lot of leopards,"" says Watson. Nobody knows how many prowled the land before the war, but about 70% of the animals' habitat has been destroyed, and only 750 to 1,000 adult leopards remain, she says.Find out more about Call to Earth and the extraordinary people working for a more sustainable futureWhat's more, leopards are at risk of getting caught in snares. The wire traps are usually set for bushmeat species, including wild boar and deer, but they are indiscriminate in what they catch.As Sri Lanka's top predator, and its only big cat, the leopard ""plays a key role"" in Sri Lanka's ecosystem, says Watson. ""We call it an umbrella species,"" she says, because taking steps to save leopards protects all the other species that share their forest home. A passion for wildlife Watson grew up in the city of Colombo, but ""I loved being out in wild spaces ... I have a strong affinity with animals"" she says.(Video courtesy of Chitral Jayatilake) In 1994 she moved to Ontario, Canada, to study at McMaster University, and met her future husband, Andrew Kittle.A few years later the couple, who share a passion for wildlife, had settled in Sri Lanka. In 2000 they launched a pilot project to study leopards in Yala National Park in the island's southeast. At the time, very little was known about the elusive animals, says Watson. To protect them, it was vital to understand their lives -- and to count them. Watson and Kittle, who went on to establish the Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) in 2004, currently work in four locations around Sri Lanka. They are investigating the size of the leopard population using remote cameras that take photos when they detect movement. Leopards that are caught on camera can be identified because each one has a unique pattern of spots -- and famously, their spots never change. Read: Google-backed project is collecting millions of wildlife camera-trap imagesInstalling the cameras is often grueling work, says Watson. It can involve long drives on spine-rattling, rocky tracks, clambering up hillsides, bushwhacking through jungle, and occasional encounters with elephants, bears and snakes, as well as leeches and ticks.Out in the field, the team collects leopard scat to find out which animals they are hunting -- leopards are not picky eaters and their diet includes deer, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and hares. Watson hopes that WWCT's data will help to shape development plans that make space for leopards. If corridors between forest patches and buffer zones around protected areas are safeguarded, both humans and animals could thrive. Watson is dedicated to ensuring that these ""beautiful, fabulous creatures"" survive. ",2
201," (CNN)Nearly a decade after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area. Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.""Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,"" James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.Photographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited. In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people. Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones. Species considered to be ""in conflict"" with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.While the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted. The study was published Monday in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, was produced in addition to the team's research on Chernobyl, where wildlife has also thrived in the wake of the disaster.",2
202,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars for years. In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.On Thursday, AutoX, an Alibaba (BABA)-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside. This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin. It also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.""It's a dream,"" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. ""After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.""Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. ""We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,"" he said. ""The AI software is better [now.]""""From a technical point of view, the car is ready,"" Xiao said. ""It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.""AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called ""Professor X."" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.Race of the robotaxiWhile AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.This year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.Recently, Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) also announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba's Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app. The startup's latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.Some of the company's lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.""The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,"" he added. ""For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.""China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.""The bar is incredibly high,"" he said. ""It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy.""",2
203,"The former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism was sentenced on Tuesday to a total of 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering.Tony Chung, 20, was charged with secession, under a sweeping national security law, and money laundering in October 2020 and was denied bail. Local media reported at the time that he was detained along with two others at a coffee shop close to the United States consulate by unidentified men and was believed to be preparing for an asylum application.Chung had entered a plea bargain, admitting guilt on the charge of secession and one count of money laundering and pleading not guilty to a sedition charge and another money laundering accusation.The plea led to a 25% reduction in his sentence, to 40 months for secession and 18 months for money laundering. Only three months of the latter will be served separately, resulting in a total sentence of 43 months.""He actively organized, planned and implemented activities to separate the country,"" District Court Judge Stanley Chan said.Prosecutor Ivan Cheung has said the defendant acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the US branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party.Pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were also seized from his home, the prosecutor said. The money laundering charge was related to donations he received via PayPal.Like other anti-government organizations, Studentlocalism disbanded before Beijing imposed the security law in June 2020, to punish anything it deems as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The vast majority of Hong Kong people do not support independence, but any mention of the idea is anathema to Beijing.Since the enactment of the security law, Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn, with most democratic politicians now in jail or in self-exile.

204,"Almost half a metric ton of meteorites declared as pyrite ore on import have been seized by authorities in the southern city of Shenzhen, China's customs agency said on Monday.Officers inspected the material and determined it was inconsistent with the characteristics of pyrite, the General Administration of Customs said in a statement, adding that the company involved was unable to provide relevant certification.Pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulfide mineral used in the paper and jewelry industries.A professional appraisal revealed the 470-kilogram shipment consisted of 90% iron and 8.9% nickel but lacked the sulfur content that pyrite has, said the statement, which was accompanied by a video of customs officers inspecting a number of brownish rocks.The appraisal also found the rocks' composition was very similar to that of meteorites, and the owner of the shipment subsequently confirmed that is exactly what they were, customs said, adding that the case was under further processing.It was not immediately clear how the owner had come into possession of the meteorites.China is stepping up its space exploration program and last year brought back rocks from the moon in the first lunar sample retrieval mission since the 1970s.",2
205,"A US warship again sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, part of what the US military calls routine activity but which always riles China whose government believes Washington is trying to stir regional tensions.The US Navy said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Milius conducted a ""routine Taiwan Strait transit"" through international waters in accordance with international law.""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows,"" it added.There was no immediate response from China.Last month, the Chinese military condemned the United States and Canada for each sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait, saying they were threatening peace and stability in the region.China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the past year or so, provoking anger in Taipei.The United States like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.Beijing calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with Washington.US Navy ships have been transiting the strait roughly monthly, to the anger of Beijing. US allies occasionally also send ships through the strait, including Britain in September.",2
206,"Seoul, South KoreaFormer South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, whose iron-fisted rule of the country following a 1979 military coup sparked massive democracy protests, died on Tuesday at the age of 90, his former press aide said.Chun had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer which was in remission, and his health had deteriorated recently, his former press secretary Min Chung-ki told reporters. He died at his Seoul home early in the morning and his body will be moved to a hospital for a funeral later in the day.A former military commander, Chun presided over the 1980 Gwangju army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators, a crime for which he was later convicted and received a commuted death sentence.His death came about a month after another former President and his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, who played a crucial but controversial role in the country's troubled transition to democracy, died at age 88.An aloof, ramrod-straight Chun during his mid-1990s trial defended the coup as necessary to save the nation from a political crisis and denied sending troops into Gwangju.""I am sure that I would take the same action, if the same situation arose,"" Chun told the court.Chun was born on March 6, 1931, in Yulgok-myeon, a poor farming town in the southeastern county of Hapcheon, during Japanese rule over Korea.He joined the military straight out of high school, working his way up the ranks until he was appointed a commander in 1979. Taking charge of the investigation into the assassination of President Park Chung-hee that year, Chun courted key military allies and gained control of South Korea's intelligence agencies to headline a December 12 coup.""In front of the most powerful organizations under the Park Chung-hee presidency, it surprised me how easily (Chun) gained control over them and how skilfully he took advantage of the circumstances. In an instant he seemed to have grown into a giant,"" Park Jun-kwang, Chun's subordinate during the coup later told journalist Cho Gab-je.Chun's eight-year rule in the presidential Blue House was characterized by brutality and political repression. It was, however, also marked by growing economic prosperity.Chun resigned from office amid a nationwide student-led democratic movement in 1987 demanding a direct electoral system.In 1995, he was charged with mutiny, treason and was arrested after refusing to appear at the prosecutors' office and fleeing to his hometown.At what local media dubbed the ""trial of the century"", he and coup co-conspirator and succeeding President Roh Tae-Woo were found guilty of mutiny, treason and bribery. In their verdict, judges said Chun's rise to power came ""through illegal means which inflicted enormous damage on the people.""Thousands of students were believed to have been killed at Gwangju, according to testimonies by survivors, former military officers and investigators.Roh was given a lengthy jail term while Chun was sentenced to death. However, that was commuted by the Seoul High Court in recognition of Chun's role in the fast-paced economic development of the Asian ""Tiger"" economy and the peaceful transfer of the presidency to Roh in 1988.Both men were pardoned and freed from jail in 1997 by President Kim Young-sam, in what he called an effort to promote ""national unity.""Chun made several returns to the spotlight. He caused a national furore in 2003 when he claimed total assets of 291,000 won ($245) of cash, two dogs and some home appliances -- while owing some 220.5 billion won in fines. His four children and other relatives were later found to own large swaths of land in Seoul and luxurious villas in the United States.Chun's family in 2013 vowed to pay off the bulk of his debt, but his unpaid fines still totaled some 100 billion won as of December 2020.In 2020, Chun was found guilty and received an eight-month suspended sentence for defaming a late democracy activist and Catholic priest in his 2017 memoirs. Prosecutors have appealed, and Chun had faced a trial next week.",2
207,"Beijing (CNN)Chinese President Xi Jinping told leaders of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at a summit on Monday that Beijing would not ""bully"" its smaller regional neighbors, amid rising tension over the South China Sea.Beijing's territorial claims over the sea clash with those of several Southeast Asian nations and have raised alarm from Washington to Tokyo.But Xi said China would never seek hegemony nor take advantage of its size to coerce smaller countries, and would work with ASEAN to eliminate ""interference.""""China was, is, and will always be a good neighbor, good friend, and good partner of ASEAN,"" Chinese state media quoted Xi as saying.China's assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea has set it against ASEAN members Vietnam and the Philippines, while Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts.The Philippines on Thursday condemned the actions of three Chinese coast guard vessels that it said blocked and used water cannon on resupply boats headed towards a Philippine-occupied atoll in the sea.The United States on Friday called the Chinese actions ""dangerous, provocative, and unjustified,"" and warned that an armed attack on Philippine vessels would invoke US mutual defense commitments.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told the summit hosted by Xi that he ""abhors"" the altercation and said the rule of law was the only way out of the dispute. He referred to a 2016 international arbitration ruling which found China's maritime claim to the sea had no legal basis.""This does not speak well of the relations between our nations,"" said Duterte, who will leave office next year and has been criticized in the past for failing to condemn China's conduct in the disputed waters.ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.Myanmar no showXi told the summit that China and ASEAN had ""cast off the gloom of the Cold War"" -- when the region was wracked by superpower competition and conflicts such as the Vietnam War -- and had jointly maintained regional stability.China frequently criticizes the United States for ""Cold War thinking"" when Washington engages its regional allies to push back against Beijing's growing military and economic influence.US President Joe Biden joined ASEAN leaders for a virtual summit in October and pledged greater engagement with the region.The summit was held without a representative from Myanmar, Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said on Monday.

208,"Kabul, Afghanistan  (CNN)Women will be barred from appearing in television dramas in Afghanistan under the Taliban's new media restrictions, in the latest rollback of women's freedoms since the militant group seized power three months ago. All dramas, soap operas and entertainment shows featuring women are prohibited, according to the government guidelines issued to broadcasters on Sunday.The country's Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice issued eight directives concerning what is allowed to be broadcast, in the first restrictions of their kind  imposed on the country's media network.Among the directives, women news presenters must now wear headscarves on screen. Similarly, men on screen must wear ""proper clothes,"" although the guidelines do not specify which types of clothes are considered ""proper."" The ministry added that films in opposition to Islamic law and Afghan values should not be broadcast, nor should foreign and domestic films that ""promote foreign culture and values.""The rules also state that entertainment and comedy programs ""should not be based on insulting others,"" nor ""for the insult of human dignity and Islamic values."" Finally, TV shows depicting the ""prophets and companions"" should not be broadcast, it said.Under the previous Taliban government -- in power from 1996 to 2001 -- television was prohibited as well as most other forms of media. Monday's tough new media rules come despite pledges from the Taliban that they would be more moderate in exercising power this time around.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in mid-August as the United States and Western allies withdrew their forces. Women and girls were quickly instructed to stay home from work and school, and the restrictions on television appearances further limit women's freedoms under the new regime.

209,"Jodhpur, India (CNN)The Child Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA) of 1929 set out to ""eradicate the evil of child marriage"" in India. Almost a century later, the south Asian nation remains home to a third of the world's child brides. As of 2017, 223 million girls and women who were married off before their 18th birthday lived in India, according to the United Nations agency, UNICEF. Only a fraction of the children entered into child marriages are boys. Between April 2019 and March 2020, Childline India received nearly nine times more complaints about the child marriage of girls than of boys.Not only did the CMRA not eradicate child marriage, the law also failed to provide a way out for those children who had already been forced into marriage.  So in 2007 the CMRA was repealed and replaced by the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), which recognized that child marriages were valid but voidable. Thanks to the PCMA, a victim of child marriage has up to two years after reaching adulthood to annul their union should they wish to -- or know to.  It is difficult to say how many young women have benefited from the annulment provision of the Act. There is not publicly available information and the Ministry of Women and Child Development has not responded to CNN's multiple requests for the number of child marriage annulments.  What is known is that at least 43 child marriages have been annulled. And what all of those stories have in common is tenacious child rights advocate named Kriti Bharti.  Married off at one  Bharti helped secure India's very first child marriage annulment and told CNN she has assisted in 42 other cases since discovering the annulment provision in the PCMA.In March 2012 she met 18-year-old Laxmi Sargara. Bharti, whose surname means ""India's daughter"" in Hindi, was 24 at the time and had just formally registered her organization, Saarthi Trust. Both women lived, and continue to live, in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, famous for its regal history and architecture, and in 2017 was home to 15 million women and girls who were married as children.Sargara had been one of them. She'd been married off at the age of one to a 3-year-old boy in a different village, but only learned of the union many years later when her in-laws came to tell her that in a few days' time she'd be moving in with them. In Rajasthan, it is not uncommon for children as young as one to be married in traditional ceremonies such as the mausar -- where a wedding takes place on the 12th day of mourning after the death of a family member. The child continues to live with their parents until their gauna -- the ritual where they are then sent to their in-laws' home after puberty. Frightened, Sargara told her parents she was going to visit her older brother in the city of Jodhpur, an hour away from their village. With his help, they reached out to Bharti, who was a social worker then with a reputation for helping child marriage victims delay their gauna. ""When Laxmi approached me, she wanted something permanent, and she didn't want a divorce for a marriage that she never consented to,"" Bharti recalls. ""After poring over hundreds of judgments and legal documents, we finally realized that there is a provision of annulment that she could use.""  ""We were using a law that no one had used before, that courts themselves did not know about,"" Bharti continues. ""Today when we file a case it's much easier but back then we were setting the precedent."" Confronting tradition Three years after that historic first annulment, Bharti met Santa Devi. Devi grew up in Rohicha Kallan, a village two hours from Jodhpur. People here are farmers or make handicrafts and furniture. After her uncle died, Devi was married in a mausar ceremony at just 11 months to a boy who was 10 at the time. Like Sargara, she would continue to be raised by her parents.  In 2010 at 15, Devi learned she was married to the 25-year-old man who she said had been following her everywhere she went and showing up outside her school for weeks. It was only when she told her father about him that she learned of her fate. ""This is what our elders have always done,"" Devi recalls him saying.  Devastated, Devi was desperate for a way out. Her search would lead her to Bharti who she calls ""didi"" -- older sister. ""Back then I couldn't speak up, I didn't even know Hindi, I had never even left my village. But when the groom's family pressured me to perform gauna, I knew I had to do something. We [Devi and a friend] looked everywhere for a solution and ultimately came across news articles of Kriti didi who nullifies child marriages,"" Devi explains.  After speaking with Devi's friend, Bharti agreed to help. They had to move quickly: Devi traveled to Jodhpur to meet Bharti and fill in the paperwork just six days before her 20th birthday, the cut-off age for annulment applications for Indian women.  Legally seeking to annul the marriage was one thing. Going up against rural institutions of power was quite another. When Devi told her father about her wish to have her marriage annulled, he met with Bharti and after being counselled by her, agreed to support his daughter. But when the village heard about what Devi had done, a meeting of the jati panchayat or caste council (made up of ""leading men of a group [who meet] to deal with the problems that affect the group"") was called and a fine of 16 lakh Rupees (about US$ 21,521) was imposed on Devi's father for breaking up a marriage. Once the jati panchayat was involved, and facing a fine and the prospect of expulsion from their village, Devi's father withdrew his support. Devi says he gave her an ultimatum: ""Rip the [annulment] papers, otherwise you are not my daughter"". ""My case was probably the worst one that didi has had to deal with...the jati panchayats gave us a lot of trouble. They threatened to kill me. If didi had not kept me with her they definitely would have killed me,"" Devi says.Caste panchayats, such as the one that fined Devi's father, act as parallel systems of law enforcement, imposing penalties ranging from fines to excommunication and even so-called honor killings, a euphemism for the brutal murders of women and girls, in contravention of the country's current laws.  ""Courts were established later, but jati panchayats have long existed so they take decisions as per tradition,"" says Bharti, explaining how these institutions preserve harmful cultural practices such as child marriage.  ""The law has not been an answer to the problem of child marriage,"" says Bharti Ali, founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights. ""[Child marriage] continues despite the law being there for a long time now"". A 2021 study (available only in Hindi) conducted by HAQ found that of 20 cases where child marriages were broken off, in seven instances the decision was made by jati panchayats. India's traditional divorce law was applied in three cases, but on only one occasion was the child marriage annulled. In all the other cases, agreements were reached between the families involved. Bharti explains that people turn to jati panchayats not knowing the difference between an annulment and a divorce and expecting divorces to be expensive, laborious processes. The caste council is also known on occasion to allow for child marriages to end but families never anticipate having to pay the fine known as the jhagda -- a Hindi word which literally translates as ""fight"".  ""The study clearly points out that decisions are taken by the panchayats. If we want these provisions of law [such as the PCMA] to be used we will have to figure out what are the local mechanisms and how can we link them to the courts,"" says Ali. But Bharti is less willing to work with these traditional institutions of power, arguing that women, perceived as having a lesser status in a patriarchal system and are therefore not allowed to attend the council meetings, do not get a fair hearing.  While she acknowledges that the legal framework isn't perfect, with the justice system often failing to treat child marriage victims as victims, she argues that the courts are still fairer. ""When you look at [formal] courts, although I agree that there is a lack of sensitivity, at least they hear both parties. Jati panchayats listen to the one who holds greater weight in society and they promote child marriage so we don't want to create a bridge with them,"" she says. What gives the panchayat power to make rulings as it does on child marriage is the fact that the customary practice remains ""largely acceptable"" as Ali puts it, in vast swathes of urban and rural India. ""Everyone belongs to a certain community. They carry a social identity with them so they first look at the interests of the community and then any other cause,"" she adds. Even Lakshman Jandu, a father who turned to Bharti for help with an annulment only after the jati panchayat asked him to pay a 15 lakh rupees (about $ 20,124) fine, admits that if his daughter's suitor had turned out to be ""a decent boy"" he would not have opposed the union. ""We didn't intend to get her married then but there was a lot of pressure from the community because the other family had another son that they wanted to marry off, so we said we'd get her married so long as their son completes his education,"" Jandu explains. ""But he got into a lot of bad habits, theft, breaking into people's houses, drinking...he was completely out of his parents' control,"" says the 54-year-old father who earns a living as a chauffeur. ""I don't see child marriage as bad but when the situation ends up like this then it is bad."" Jandu's experience confirms what Bharti has seen: that despite policymakers seeing the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act as ""the exit policy"" for all victims of a child marriage, their families -- whose support is often essential -- only use it if there is some other problem in the marriage, and not because a girl was married off as a child. ""In the beginning the parents are usually against it, they worry about what the jati panchayats and the community will say. So the first thing we do is counsel the parents,"" says Bharti.  'I want girls to speak up for themselves'Child marriage rates have been declining In India. In 1970, 74% of girls were married off before their 18th birthday and 42% before they turned 15. In 2015, those percentages had fallen to 27% and 7% respectively. The trend has been attributed to access to education, and ""public messaging around the illegality of child marriage"". Despite the decline there are still a lot of girls Bharti describes as forgotten.It is also true that in India marriage offers women security and status, so Bharti knows that the young women she works with are going to need equipping to navigate life on their own, or until they chose to remarry on their own terms. ""I tell all the girls that I will only take their case if they promise to continue their education,"" she says. ""I want them to get to a place where they are able to speak up for themselves and protest if they are ever pressured to get married again against their will.""  Devi, whose marriage was annulled in 2015, had to live with Bharti during the process of annulment and later at the shelter that Bharti runs. She says continuing with her education -- and Bharti's reputation -- gave her the confidence to eventually start going back to her village home.  ""I wanted to study and work like all girls dream of growing up and working, and I got to do exactly that,"" says Devi, who now works at an insurance company. ""Now I go home often, because I've made something of myself. Initially, people were scared if they heard about me visiting; they thought I would call didi. Young girls often come to me if they think a child marriage is going to take place and I give them didi's number."" Helping young women imagine a life for themselves after child marriage and then supporting them as they build that life has been rewarding for Bharti but it has also been risky. ""I may not get breakfast, lunch or dinner on some days, but I definitely receive threats on a daily basis,"" says Bharti, who lives with her mother. ""I have also had instances of receiving fake tips about a child marriage taking place in attempts to lure me to a certain location. Call it a gut feeling or intuition, luckily I've avoided the worst,"" she adds. When asked if she has been to the police to report any of the threats she receives, Bharti says doing so would only make it harder for her to interact with the people she is trying to help because it would alienate her from them.   She knows the risks she is taking to help girls use a little-known law to fight a long-held tradition, yet she does it anyway. ""[The law had previously forgotten] about girls once they are married off, but they are the ones who need our help the most... No one is immortal, so if I can help even 10 girls along the way, I'm happy to take the risk.""  Read more from the As Equals series ",2
210,"Manila (Reuters)The Philippines' defense chief said on Sunday a military resupply mission for the country's troops stationed on an atoll in the South China Sea will resume this week, after it was aborted last week when it was blocked by Chinese coast guard.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he had instructed the military to send its resupply vessels back to the Philippines-occupied Second Thomas Shoal, and that China ""will not interfere"" this time.On Thursday, the Philippines condemned ""in strongest terms actions of three Chinese coast guard vessels that it said blocked and used water cannon on resupply boats headed toward Second Thomas Shoal, which is locally known as Ayungin Shoal.The United States called the Chinese actions ""dangerous, provocative, and unjustified,"" and warned that an armed attack on Philippine vessels would invoke US mutual defense commitments.""The Chinese will not interfere per my conversation with the Chinese ambassador (Huang Xilian),"" said Lorenzana.Lorenzana said he and Huang had been talking ""since the evening of the 16th while the incident was happening until yesterday, 20 November.""The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.There will be no navy or coast guard escorts for the Philippines' resupply boats when they sail back to Second Thomas Shoal, Lorenzana said.""They (China) have no right to impede, prevent or harass our ships within our EEZ (exclusive economic zone), whether we are fishing or bringing supplies to our detachment in the Sierra Madre (navy ship) in Ayungin Shoal,"" he said.The chief of the Philippine military's Western Command, Vice Adm. Ramil Roberto Enriquez, meanwhile said the number of Chinese coast guard vessels in Second Thomas Shoal had gone down to two as of Saturday night from three on Tuesday.He said the Chinese maritime militia vessels had also left the shoal. China has denied operating a militia.There were 19 vessels near Second Thomas Shoal recently and 45 near Thitu Island, another Philippines-occupied area, according to National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon.",2
211,"Hong Kong (CNN)In Shanghai's sprawling Jiangnan Shipyard, workers are fitting the catapults that will separate China's latest and most advanced aircraft carrier from its two older sister ships.Once launched, the high-tech vessel will be able to propel planes into the sky at the same speed as its US counterparts, another example of China's rapid military modernization.It's a trend that is putting the entire region on edge.In recent months, global attention has been fixed on rising tensions between Taipei and Beijing -- but the threat of conflict in Asia stretches far beyond the Taiwan Strait.Across the region, countries are engaged in their own quiet arms race to avoid being left behind. But experts warn that any miscalculation could lead to conflict in a region already riven by border disputes and old rivalries. In East Asia, Japan and South Korea are rapidly modernizing their militaries in response to threats from China and North Korea, whose leadership is particularly sensitive to signs of military progress nearby. Last month, after South Korea tested a new missile, Pyongyang admonished Seoul for its ""reckless ambition.""Meanwhile, India's increased military investment after clashes with China on their disputed Himalayan border risks inflaming tensions with its longtime rival, Pakistan.Similarly, countries with overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea may struggle to maintain a diplomatic status quo as Beijing aggressively stakes its claim to strategically valuable shipping lanes.The region is trapped in a ""security dilemma"" -- a geopolitical spiral where countries repeatedly reinforce their own militaries in response to the growth of their neighbors' forces, said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.""The potential for a major power war is increasing,"" he said. ""We are building up to a potential crisis.""The military rise of ChinaUnder President Xi Jinping, China's military has rapidly expanded.China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) now fields the world's largest navy, technologically advanced stealth fighter jets and a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons -- and the military modernization has only begun.China's military budget is growing every year, likely above $200 billion in 2021, and while it is still far below the estimated $740 billion 2022 US defense budget, the PLA is closing the technological gap with the American military.Along with the third aircraft carrier being built in Shanghai, the Pentagon claimed China recently tested a hypersonic missile.""What we saw was a very significant event of a test of a hypersonic weapon system. And it is very concerning,"" said Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. China said it wasn't a missile but a ""routine spacecraft experiment.""And it isn't just China's military buildup that is unsettling the region, but its attitude as well. Speaking at a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party in July, Xi said China would no longer be ""bullied, oppressed or subjugated"" and anyone who tried would ""find their heads bashed bloody against a great wall of steel.""In a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden this week, Xi said China would take ""resolute measures"" if separatist forces in Taiwan crossed a ""red line,""  according to a Chinese readout of the meeting.""Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,"" the statement quoted Xi as saying. Over the past few years, a new breed of combative Chinese diplomats, nicknamed ""wolf warriors,"" have been pushing back hard in press conferences and on social media against any perceived slights toward China.Arzan Tarapore, South Asia research scholar at Stanford University, said Beijing's aggressive posturing and diplomacy under Xi was alarming its neighbors. ""This is not just the brashness of ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy but an apparent willingness to press its territorial claims with force,"" he said.Since the end of World War II, the US has been a major guarantor of peace and stability in the region, particularly through its close security alliances with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.But the threat of a US withdrawal from the region under former US President Donald Trump, combined with his ""America First"" policies that saw the country turn inward, undermined trust in Washington's engagement in the region. Since being elected, Biden has affirmed his commitment to the Indo-Pacific, but the threat of a second Trump administration in 2024 and the chaos that resulted from the US withdrawal in Afghanistan, has led American security partners in Asia to beef up their own militaries against any eventualities, Tarapore said.""I fear there will always now be a little asterisk when regional countries consider the US -- that it is not immune from domestic instability or strategic madness,"" Tarapore said.Japan and South Korea build their forcesTwo of the countries with the most rapid militarization are those geographically closest to China: Japan and South Korea.Ahead of his election win in October, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida promised to double the country's military budget if he was reelected -- raising it to 2% of the GDP for the first time since World War II.There is no timeline for the unprecedented increase, but it would allow the Japanese government to quickly expand its forces at a time when Tokyo feels under growing pressure from neighboring North Korea and China.Japan recently announced plans to deploy more missiles in 2022 to its Okinawa island chain that sits just a few hundred miles from the Chinese mainland. Experts see the deployment as a deterrent to any moves by Beijing against Taiwan.It has also expanded its military in recent years with F-35 fighter jets licensed or purchased from the US, along with repurposed aircraft carriers to transport them. The country's Self-Defense Forces are also looking to add high-tech submarines, destroyers and stealth fighters to their arsenal.While Japan's neighbor North Korea is often in the news for its missile program, South Korea is also rapidly expanding its forces. Seoul is looking to build up its military, partly to make it less reliant on its longtime security partner, the United States.In September, Seoul announced it had successfully tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), one of the first major trials since Biden agreed to end a 40-year-old treaty limiting South Korea's weapons program.The limits were put in place in 1979 to prevent a missile development arms race between the two Koreas. The end of the treaty is another step by South Korea towards military independence, which could provoke a more intense arms race with the North. South Korea is already planning to commission its first aircraft carrier, for potential deployment in 2033.While both Japan and South Korea are longtime US security partners, with uneasy relationships with China and North Korea, their bilateral ties are at times marred by historical grievances and territorial disputes. The two governments regularly clash diplomatically over historic human rights abuses during the early 20th century, when Japan occupied South Korea, and experts said neither government is likely to want the other to pull ahead too far militarily.""Some right-wing leaders in Tokyo will say, 'look at South Korea, it has an aircraft carrier, a full-fledged aircraft carrier, we need to have one also ... as a matter of national pride,'"" Lionel Fatton, Indo-Pacific affairs expert at Webster University in Switzerland, said.The slow arms raceNot every country allied with the US is seeking more military independence. In a shock announcement in September, Australia tied itself more closely to Washington by forming a new security alliance with the US and UK in the Indo-Pacific. Under the agreement, known as AUKUS, the allies will share information, including US technology that could see Australia acquire its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. That would allow Australia to extend its reach into the South China Sea while also solidifying a foothold for London and Washington in the region.The decision made it clear that Australia was choosing the US over China, shifting the balance of the power in the Asia-Pacific.It also unsettled nations across Southeast Asia, which are struggling to maintain a cordial relationship with Beijing while protecting their own interests.Both Malaysia and Indonesia publicly voiced their reservations about the AUKUS deal, with Jakarta saying it was concerned it could lead to a regional arms race. The US ambassador to Indonesia, Sung Kim, said at the time that those concerns were unwarranted.Indonesia itself is in the midst of attempting a major military modernization. President Joko Widodo called for a $125 billion investment in June, and has increased military patrols of the South China Sea, where China claims a huge swathe of territory that overlaps areas claimed by other nations.But other claimants to the South China Sea -- including Philippines and Vietnam -- are struggling with their own military buildup, ASPI's Davis said. In July, Vietnam military expert Nguyen The Phuong wrote that Vietnam's military modernization had effectively ground to a halt, due to budgetary constraints and alleged corruption in the armed forces. And in September, Philippines Defense Minister Delfin Lorenzana blamed the US for refusing to provide high-tech weapons to his country, leaving them with ""Vietnam War-era"" castoffs.Davis said the traditional stance for ASEAN nations, including Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, has been to avoid conflict in favor of maintaining the status quo and remaining non-aligned.But he warned any further aggression by Beijing in the South China Sea could push countries to adopt a more militaristic stance. ""If the Chinese declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in the South China Sea or took additional territories or started creating additional artificial islands ... (it) could actually then generate the ASEAN states to actually make that step,"" he said.Military threats in South AsiaApart from Taiwan, most experts said the most dangerous military standoff in Asia is the border between China and India. As recently as June 2020, dozens of Chinese and Indian soldiers were killed in clashes in the Galwan Valley, in an area claimed as part of Xinjiang by China and part of Ladakh by India. Since then multiple unconfirmed reports suggest troops are being sent to the border by both Beijing and Delhi.India has the third-largest military budget in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, valued at around $72 billion, and fields an army of more than 3 million people.It has also been engaged in its own program of military modernization, purchasing new equipment, including 83 locally made fighter aircraft and 56 of Airbus' C295 transport aircraft. India has a homemade aircraft carrier, the INS Vikrant, in sea trials and is undertaking missile tests to improve its ballistic arsenal.But Stanford's Tarapore said the approach was still piecemeal. ""The Air Force as a whole is in dire need of recapitalization, and the Navy is retiring submarines faster than it is replacing them,"" he said.But any additional moves by India to beef up its armed forces may be viewed unfavorably by neighboring Pakistan, Tarapore said. The two nuclear powers have had an uneasy peace for decades, with multiple disputes across their land border.Tarapore said it was unlikely India could tailor its military growth in a way which wouldn't cause concern in Pakistan -- and so it may not attempt to appease Islamabad and carry on regardless.""Delhi knows that, short of some unlikely grand political bargain, the specific shape of its military modernization won't mollify Pakistan in any meaningful way, so it may as well do what's needed to meet its pressing military threats,"" he said.A safer Asia Pacific?China is showing no signs of halting its military growth, and Beijing has partially attributed that to one major factor -- the US.In recent years, the American military has been growing its presence in the Asia Pacific region, including undertaking frequent Freedom of Navigation Operations near Chinese-held islands in the South China Sea and sailing vessels through the Taiwan Strait.In July, the US sent more than two dozen advanced F-22 stealth fighters to Guam for exercises, while the USS Carl Vinson, the first US Navy aircraft carrier to be equipped with F-35C fighters, undertook drills with Japan's Self-Defense Forces in the South China Sea in September.The Chinese Foreign Ministry has regularly accused Washington of being responsible for the militarization in the Asia Pacific. And as China builds up its forces in response, so too do the country's neighbors.As a result, there is no end in sight for militarization in the region and most experts said it will likely speed up, increasing the chance for miscalculation and conflict.Politicians and experts around the region have compared the arms race and tensions in the Asia Pacific to Europe in the 1930s, shortly before the start of World War II.Peter Layton, visiting fellow at Griffith University's Asia Institute, said the chance of a war between major powers in the Asia region in the next 10 years is rising, but he hopes economic and trade interdependence between China and its rivals in Asia, as well as the US, could help to deter any military action. ""The question is whether the economic system is strong enough to avoid military conflict,"" he said. However Layton said while the economic interdependency might prevent war in Asia, it could spark growing economic coercion across the region, such as the trade restrictions China has leveled at Australia over the past year.""They can ... use positive or negative sanctions to control most people using the power of money,"" he said.ASPI's Davis said while he expects the arms race in Asia to make the region more dangerous, he doesn't think nations have ""much of a choice.""He believes the Chinese government's aggressive behavior and military modernization will continue no matter how its neighbors react. ""Even if we didn't respond, they would keep on going,"" he said.In fact, Tarapore said it is possible that military weakness in and of itself could provoke aggression, while military power ""may also be frightening to erstwhile aggressors and serve to deter rather than provoke war.""The time is coming, Tarapore said, when countries in Asia will have to choose ""what form of safety is most important to us"" -- the safety of a military deterrent or any protection offered by acquiescing to Beijing's expansion.  ""Arms races are costly. Losing them can be costlier,"" he said.",2
212," (CNN)Three construction workers have died after scaffolding collapsed in northern Taiwan on Saturday, Taiwan's official Central News Agency (CNA) reported. The incident, which left two others injured with leg fractures, occurred at a metro construction site in Sanxia, New Taipei City, according to CNA.The report did not say what caused the collapse.  New Taipei City mayor Hou You-yi said the municipal government postponed construction and ordered an investigation. Of the fatalities, one worker was from Thailand while the other two were from Taiwan, CNA reported. ",2
213,"The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has suspended a probe at Manila's request into suspected rights abuses during Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's crackdown on drugs.ICC judges approved a probe in September into the campaign in which thousands of suspected drug peddlers have died. Activists say many have been executed by law enforcement agencies with the tacit backing of the President.Philippine authorities say the killings were in self-defense and that the ICC has no right to meddle.Court documents released by the ICC and confirmed by Philippine officials on Saturday showed that Manila filed the deferral request on November 10, citing the country's own investigations into drug war killings.""The prosecution has temporarily suspended its investigative activities while it assesses the scope and effect of the deferral request,"" ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan wrote, adding that it would seek additional information from the Philippines.Governments can ask the ICC to defer a case if they are implementing their own investigations and prosecutions for the same acts.Duterte, 76, pulled the Philippines out of the ICC in 2018 and has said the international court has no jurisdiction to indict him. The ICC maintains it has jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed while Manila was a member and up until 2019.The Manila request for the deferral follows repeated statements by the Duterte government that it would not cooperate with the ICC.""We welcome the judiciousness of the new ICC prosecutor who has deemed it fit to give the matter a fresh look, and we trust that the matter will be resolved in favor of the exoneration of our government and the recognition of the vibrancy of our justice system,"" Karlo Nograles, acting spokesperson for Duterte, said in a statement on Saturday.A Philippine lawyers group called on the ICC not to remove the glimmer of hope for families of drug-war victims.""We ask the ICC not to allow itself to be swayed by the claims now being made by the Duterte administration,"" the National Union of People's Lawyers, which represents some victims' families, said in a statement.The Philippine justice system is ""extremely slow and unavailing to the majority of poor and unrepresented victims"", the statement said.Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the government's claim that existing domestic mechanisms afford citizens justice was absurd. ""Let's hope the ICC sees through the ruse that it is,"" Brad Adam, HRW Asia director, said in a statement.The ICC decision is a boost for Duterte, who this week launched a run for the Senate in elections next year. He is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election as president.""It will of course provide some relief in the raucous elections,"" political analyst Ramon Casiple, vice president of consulting and research firm Novo Trends PH, told Reuters. ""However, it may not enable (him) to do more after the elections, particularly if the incoming government chooses to cooperate with the ICC process.""In its nearly two-decade existence, the ICC has convicted five men for war crimes and crimes against humanity, all African militia leaders from Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali and Uganda.",2
214,"Chiayi Air Base, Taiwan (CNN)Taiwan on Thursday showed off its newest military hardware -- upgraded F-16 fighter jets that would be at the heart of the island's defense in the event of an air attack from China.The F-16s screamed across the sky at Chiayi Air Base on the island's southwestern coast as pilots performed aerial maneuvers to demonstrate the capabilities of Taiwan's first squadron of US-made F-16V, or Viper, fighter jets.The planes were upgraded from older F-16A/B fighter jets, originally acquired by Taiwan in the 1990s, and are equipped with advanced radar systems and new mission computers, according to the official Central News Agency (CNA). The island has plans to upgrade 141 fighters to the newer version by 2023, it added.That upgrade has already been done to more than 60 F-16s, Vice Defense Minister Wang Hsin-lung told Taiwan's Parliament on Wednesday.Taiwan has also purchased 66 new F-16Vs from manufacturer Lockheed Martin in the United States, and delivery is expected to start in 2023, CNA reported.  More than two dozen of the F-16Vs were on display at the Chiayi base on Thursday.During the commissioning ceremony, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said the formation of a new F-16V combat wing has demonstrated the deepening friendship between the island and the US. ""The Lockheed Martin team has provided us with a lot of assistance in completing the upgrade,"" she said. ""This not only signals the further progress of Taiwan-US friendship, but also represents a firm commitment to Taiwan-US relations."" Beijing's ruling Communist Party has been stepping up its military pressure on Taiwan, including sending 150 warplanes near the island in just five days in October, prompting Taipei to issue radio warnings and deploy air defense missile systems to monitor the activity.When the sale of the 66 jets to Taiwan was announced last year, analysts said they would provide a competent aircraft to compete with China's while boosting morale among the island's fighter pilots.""This is a very capable aircraft. It's small, it's nimble, it's easy to fly. Pilots love it,"" Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said.He noted the fighter can function in many roles, including launching missiles at ships, taking out enemy radar, as well as in air-to-air confrontations.Australian military analyst Peter Layton of the Griffith Asia Institute said last year that the F-16 sale could help stabilize the Taiwan situation, at least from a military standpoint.""The sale will act to broadly maintain the air combat balance"" between Taiwanese (ROCAF) and Chinese (PLAAF) air forces, Layton said.""The PLAAF has significantly more air combat aircraft than the ROCAF, but in a conflict the ROCAF will be defending and the PLAAF attacking. The difference in roles and that the ROCAF will be operating over its own airfields compensates for the difference in numbers,"" he said.""The additional F-16s will simply keep the balance into the early 2030s,"" Layton said.Communist authorities in Beijing have refused to rule out the use of force to take Taiwan despite having never ruled it. The democratic island has had its own government and military since the end of the Chinese Civil War more than seven decades ago.US military sales to Taiwan are authorized under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act as long as they are of a ""defensive character."" The act was signed into law after Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing with a caveat that Taiwan's future would be determined by peaceful means.The subject of Taiwan was high on the agenda during a virtual summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday. In the talks, Biden raised his concerns over Beijing's behavior in the region. While he reaffirmed the US ""One China"" policy, which recognizes Beijing's claim of sovereignty but allows for US defense ties with Taiwan, he voiced worry that China's actions were destabilizing the region.According to a readout of the meeting from China's Foreign Ministry, Xi blamed rising tensions across the Taiwan Strait on what he called Taipei's attempt to ""rely on the US to seek independence,"" and ""the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China.""In her speech Thursday, Taiwanese President Tsai thanked the air force for working ""day and night"" to protect Taiwan. ""Regardless of any intrusion, (our air force) can immediately take to the skies to intercept and expel the intruders. This has demonstrated our determination to defend our airspace."" ""I believe that, as long as we continue to defend our free and democratic values, more countries with similar ideals will stand with us,"" she added. ",2
215,"Manila, PhilippinesPhilippine leader Rodrigo Duterte declared on Thursday in a televised speech that an unnamed candidate for next year's presidential election was a cocaine user.Duterte, who waged a war on drugs that killed thousands of users and peddlers, did not name the candidate, nor provide evidence to support his allegation, but said he was ""a very weak leader"".Dozens of people have registered to run for President in next year's polls. Duterte, 76, is not eligible for re-election due to the constitution's one-term limit.""We have a candidate using cocaine,"" Duterte said in a speech in the province of Oriental Mindoro.""That is why I am wondering, 'What has this person done? What contribution has he made for the Philippines? Why are the Filipinos crazy supporting ... I am just asking,"" added Duterte, who will run for a seat in the senate next year.Reuters asked Duterte's acting spokesperson, Karlo Nograles, who the President was referring to and for more details, but received no immediate response.""He is a very weak leader,"" the outspoken Duterte said of the unnamed candidate. ""He might win hands down. If that is what the Filipino wants, go ahead,"" he said in the speech, confirmed by a transcript provided by his office.""I am not making intrigues. It is up to you. Find out who.""In the same speech he praised his chosen successor and longtime aide, Christopher ""Bong"" Go, a senator who is seeking the presidency.Other prominent presidential candidates include senator and retired boxing icon Manny Pacquiao, Vice President Leni Robredo, Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso, senator and former police chief Panfilio Lacson, and Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son and namesake of the late Philippine dictator, whose running mate is Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio.",2
216,"US prosecutors on Thursday announced sex-trafficking charges alleging that girls and young women were coerced to have sex with the founder of a Philippines-based church who is a friend and adviser to Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte.A 74-page indictment charges Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, founder of a church called Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name (KOJC) and other church officials, including two US-based church administrators, with running a sex-trafficking operation that threatened victims as young as 12 with ""eternal damnation"" and physical abuse.Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles said the new indictment expanded on allegations made last year against three church administrators based in the city. It charges nine defendants with participating in a scheme in which church members were brought to the United States using fraudulently obtained visas and forced to solicit donations to a bogus children's charity.Prosecutors said the donations were used to pay for ""lavish lifestyles"" of the church leaders.The latest indictment adds Quiboloy and five other new defendants to an existing indictment filed in 2020. Prosecutors said US authorities arrested three of the new defendants on Thursday, but three others, including Quiboloy, were believed to be in the Philippines.Lawyers for the new defendants could not immediately be identified and the Philippines embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The indictment alleges that Quiboloy and two other defendants recruited females aged 12 to 25 as personal assistants, or ""pastorals."" It said they were required to prepare Quiboloy's meals, clean his residences, give him massages and have sex with him during what they called ""night duty.""Quiboloy, a self-proclaimed ""Owner of the Universe"" and ""Appointed Son of God"", is a longtime friend and spiritual adviser of Duterte. The influential evangelist is followed by millions of Filipinos.In September, Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, a candidate for next year's presidential election who has frequently clashed with Duterte, sued Quiboloy for libel after he accused the multiple world champion of embezzling funds intended for a sports complex.Church leaders are highly influential in Philippine elections.Duterte is prevented by the constitution from running for a second term as president. He has reacted negatively in the past to attacks on allies and last year vowed to terminate a key military pact with the United States after a Philippine senator who was an ally was denied a US visa.",2
217," (CNN)A baby girl who was only 5 days old when she was found in a drain in India's financial capital of Mumbai has been discharged from hospital.The baby, who left hospital on Wednesday, was rescued after a ""good Samaritan"" called the Pant Nagar Police Station to report that a baby wrapped in cloth had been ""dumped in a drain,"" Mumbai Police tweeted Monday. ""He was alerted when the neighbourhood cats created a ruckus,"" Mumbai Police said.Senior Police Inspector Suhas Kamble told CNN that the baby was rescued Sunday by Sheetal Sonawane, a female constable who is part of one of Mumbai's women's safety units known as the Nirbhaya squad.The squads were established in every Mumbai police station after the alleged rape and murder of a 34-year-old woman in Mumbai earlier this year. The squads are named after the pseudonym used to identify the victim of a 2012 gang rape and murder in Delhi that shone a global spotlight on shocking rates of sexual assault in India.The baby was admitted to Rajawadi Hospital in Mumbai and was kept under observation before being discharged on Wednesday to the police, according to Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of the hospital.""She was completely fine when she was admitted but we were a little worried because she was abandoned and found in a drain, but she was fine,"" Thakur told CNN on Thursday. ""Our doctors immediately treated her... she was discharged yesterday, she is doing fine.""After being discharged from hospital the baby was handed over to Mumbai's Child Welfare Committee and is being taken care of at a shelter home, said Kamble.On Sunday the police registered a first information report (FIR) against unknown persons for ""exposure and abandonment of child under twelve years, by parent or person having care of it,"" according to the relevant section of India's penal code.""The investigation is ongoing,"" Kamble added.Gender inequality is pervasive in India, where a preference for sons has given rise to the birth of millions of ""unwanted"" girls who often face discrimination in their communities.A 2020 report by the United Nations Population Fund said, ""between 2013 and 2017, about 460,000 girls in India were 'missing' at birth each year."" ""Missing"" girls refers to the number of girls missing from the population within the time period as a cumulative effect of sex-selection practices.In October 2019 a 4-day-old baby girl was rescued after she was found buried alive in a cemetery in northern India.The infant was pulled to safety by an unsuspecting couple in Uttar Pradesh state as they were burying their own child who had died in hospital.",2
218," (CNN)Once more, tensions are rising in Ukraine.Reports that the Russians are moving military hardware some 250 kilometers from the border have raised eyebrows in Washington. And Ukrainian forces have deployed combat drones along the battle lines that separate them from pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region. The front lines of the conflict -- a standoff stretching hundreds of miles from northern Ukraine to the Sea of Azov -- have barely moved in five years.  On Monday, US Defense Department spokesman Admiral John Kirby said the Pentagon was ""aware of public reports of unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine.""  Satellite imagery has shown Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300km) from the border.But Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Monday it had recorded no ""additional transfer of Russian units, weapons and military equipment to the state border of Ukraine.""  On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry said an estimated 90,000 Russian troops were located ""near the border and in the temporarily occupied territories"" as well as in the Black Sea.Ukraine's Defense Ministry added that Russia had established a practice of ""transferring and accumulating military units for the purpose of maintaining tension in the region and political pressure on neighboring countries.""Kirby said the US was watching closely: ""I can't speak for Russian intentions, but we are certainly monitoring the region closely, as we always do. Any escalatory or aggressive actions would be of great concern to the United Sates.""  On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""The movement of our military equipment or army units across the territory of the Russian Federation is exclusively our business.""Russia has never threatened anyone, is not threatening, and does not pose a danger to anyone,"" he insisted.Observers say Russia's actions are worth keeping a close eye on.  ""At the moment it is a developing situation. It's not 'nothing happening' and it doesn't mean that there will be an offensive op tomorrow,"" says Michael Kofman, a fellow at the Wilson Center who researches Russia's military.  'Provocation' claimsWe've been here before -- several times -- since the separatists, with Russian backing, entered eastern Ukraine in 2014.Heightened tensions have, in the past, come to nought. Russian units gathered near the border last spring -- setting off alarm bells in western capitals -- but eventually returned to base. But hopes that the frozen conflict might be defused through negotiations sponsored by European governments and the US are moribund.  Russia has responded swiftly to Ukraine's use of Turkish-made combat drones for the first time in the conflict. One of those drones struck a separatist position last week.  ""We observe attempts to carry out provocations, elicit some reaction from the militia and drag Russia into some kind of combat action,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian state television Monday.  Popular Russian TV host Vladimir Soloviev went further, saying Ukraine was provoking the separatist-held ""Republics"" into taking ""retaliatory measures, which means a major war. Under these circumstances, Moscow will be confronted with a serious choice.""  Russian rhetoric towards Ukraine has hardened in recent months.  Both President Vladimir Putin and his predecessor, Dmitri Medvedev, have penned essays describing Ukraine as a vassal of the West -- even going so far as to suggest it is not a real country.  In a long article in July, Putin said ""the formation of an ethnically pure Ukrainian state, aggressive towards Russia, is comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us.""  ""True sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia,"" he wrote.Pivot from east to westMoscow's strategy is aimed at deterring Ukraine's flirtation with closer ties to NATO and the European Union, a pivot from east to west that would stoke historic Russian fears of encirclement.  Those fears deepened when the former Soviet Baltic states joined NATO, along with several ex-members of the Warsaw Pact, such as Romania and Poland.  Just last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated US support for Ukraine's ""reorientation,"" pledging ""continued US support for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.""  Ukraine joining NATO would be an ""extremely dangerous"" move that would trigger retaliatory measures from Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko retorted.  Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Peskov condemned what he said were ""aggressive expansionist tendencies, especially on the part of NATO and other countries,"" adding that ""Russia has always taken measures to ensure its security and will continue to do so.""  The US, which already supplies Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, also promised to support Ukrainian forces through security assistance, including efforts to enhance the country's maritime capacity. US warships regularly patrol the Black Sea -- much to Russia's ire.  Russia's latest weapon in the conflict is not camo-painted. Instead, it comes through a pipeline. The Nord Stream 2 (NS2) gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany is near completion, and that worries Ukraine -- which has been a transit route for Russian gas through its extensive network of pipelines.""Putin is telling everyone to their face: 'You allow NS2 to become operational or you won't get any more gas,'"" according to Yuriy Vitrenko, chief executive of Ukraine's Naftogaz.  Vitrenko told the Financial Times that ""[If] there will be no physical transit going through Ukraine, it increases the chances of a full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine.""The White House said at the weekend that US President Joe Biden had spoken with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about efforts ""to ensure that Russia cannot manipulate natural gas flows for harmful political purposes.""  As yet, there are no signs that all the adversarial language is translating into a higher level of hostilities along what's known as ""the line of contact,"" but Russian calculations are never easy to gauge.",2

""We do know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and then using that as an excuse to do what Russia's planning to do all along.""The Kremlin has responded by accusing western countries of ""hysteria"" about Russia invading Ukraine.Strait jacketWith tensions high in the region, CNN joined the Ukrainian navy vessel departing from Berdyansk on Ukraine's Azov coastline. Usually, Commander Ovchar's crew comes across six or seven Russian coast guard patrol boats, he says, but on this mission, there were none.The sea he's patrolling borders Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow following a controversial referendum in 2014, in violation of international law.Since seizing Crimea, Russia has built a bridge linking it to its own territory. The Kerch Bridge over the Kerch Strait serves as the only direct connection between Russia and Crimea -- and gives Moscow de facto control of the sea's access to the Black Sea and Mediterranean beyond.But Ukraine has a plan to try to keep Moscow from taking complete control of the body of water that links Ukraine's two biggest ports, Berdyansk and Mariupol.Ukraine's new Defense Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced November 13 that the pace of building a new naval port in Berdyansk was to be increased. On Tuesday, CNN gained exclusive access to the ""Sehid"" or ""East"" base under construction.It was immediately clear that a lot of work still needed to be done for this base to be anywhere near completion.The aim was to complete the first phase of construction -- new living quarters, administrative buildings and a small medical facility on the site of a disused tin factory -- by the end of year. However, with less than six weeks to go, there was not even a roof on the main building.A special detachment of military builders toiled with masonry, slapping on cement and laying bricks, a Ukrainian flag billowing as they worked.The scale of the task at hand became even starker as we walked down onto the port, joined to a commercial port.""This will be the position of the docks,"" Capt. 2nd Class Alexander Serdiyk said, pointing to heaps of warped metal and boulders lying haphazardly in the sea. ""We plan to have this section completed in two years.""But Ukraine may not have two years to prepare for conflict.The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, Brigader General Kyrylo Budanov, told the US defense newspaper Military Times that Russia was increasing troop levels and weapons systems in Crimea for an offensive that could come at any time. The Kremlin has repeatedly said it has no plans to invade Ukraine. ""The American and Ukrainian media claim that Russia is preparing for an attack on Ukraine, and we are saying that Ukraine is planning hostilities against Donbas, against the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, said Tuesday. ""We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for an attempt to forcefully resolve the Donbas issue.""  Ukraine's allies have begun responding to what they see as a fresh threat from its neighbor to the east.On Monday, CNN reported that the Biden administration was weighing the possibility of sending military advisers and new equipment, including weaponry, to Ukraine. The package could include Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-armor missiles and mortars.The US is also considering sanctions with European allies if Russia invades Ukraine.Last week, British Defence Minister Ben Wallace visited Ukraine and signed an agreement to ""develop the capabilities of the naval forces of Ukraine."" CNN learned Tuesday that part of the deal will focus on Berdyansk.The same day, the Ukrainian navy announced the arrival of two ""Island-type"" boats named ""Fastiv"" and ""Sumy,"" delivered from Baltimore in the United States to Odessa in Ukraine.""Soon the boats will raise the Ukrainian navy flag and under the command of Ukrainian crews they will begin their combat journey to ensure maritime safety in the Black and Azov seas,"" Admiral Alexey Neizhpapa said.The bigger question is whether new Ukrainian ships and infrastructure, plus warnings from the West, will be enough of a deterrent.

221,"Rome (CNN)Rudy Guede, the only person to remain convicted over the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy, has been released from prison, his lawyer Fabrizio Ballarini told CNN on Tuesday.Kercher's body was found in the apartment she shared with roommate Amanda Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. The 21-year-old's throat had been slashed.Knox was arrested alongside her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. They, and Guede, were formally charged the following summer. All three were convicted, but Knox and Sollecito's convictions were overturned in 2015.Prosecutors argued that Kercher had been murdered after refusing to participate in a drug-fueled sex game played by Knox, Sollecito and Guede. Guede, originally from Ivory Coast, requested a separate fast-track trial, fearing that Knox and Sollecito had formed a pact against him. He was convicted of murder in October 2008, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. His sentence was reduced to 16 years on appeal in December 2009.Knox and Sollecito, who insisted they were away from the apartment on the night Kercher was killed, were found guilty of murder in December 2009; Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and Sollecito to 25. The verdicts marked the beginning of a lengthy legal saga for Knox and Sollecito.",2
222," (CNN)At least 45 people, including 12 children, were killed when their bus crashed and erupted in flames in Bulgaria early Tuesday, authorities said. Authorities believe the bus was carrying a total of 52 passengers, most of whom were tourists from North Macedonia, when the incident occurred at around 3 a.m. local time Tuesday.The bus, which had a North Macedonian registration, was traveling on the Struma highway west of the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The bus driver was among the dead, according to Bulgarian National Television (BNT).After initially reporting 46 deaths, authorities later said it was unclear whether 45 or 46 people had died, BNT reported.Authorities said seven people -- two women and five men -- who were traveling in the back of the bus survived by breaking the windows to escape. They have been taken to Pirogov emergency hospital in Sofia and are in stable condition.Authorities added that identification of the dead would be difficult as the bodies were severely damaged by the fire, BNT reported. Bulgarian Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov, who visited the crash site, told reporters he saw bodies ""clustered inside"" and ""burnt to ash."" He said ""the picture is terrifying,"" adding ""I have never seen anything like this before."" The cause of the accident was unclear but the bus appeared to have hit a highway barrier either before or after it caught fire, Bulgarian officials said.Footage from Nova TV Bulgaria showed the charred remains of the bus on the side of the highway, with the mangled barrier wedged beneath the vehicle. Emergency responders were seen standing near fire trucks and a police van while an investigator in a white protective suit surveyed the scene taking photographs. Behind the vehicle, damage to the center divider was visible with debris strewn across both sides of the highway. Speaking alongside Rashkov, the director of Bulgaria's National Investigation Service, Borislav Sarafov, called the incident ""a huge tragedy"" and offered his condolences to the families of the victims. Sarafov said the bus was one of four belonging to a tourist company from North Macedonia that entered Bulgaria late Monday from Turkey, BNT reported. The bus was returning to Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, from Istanbul -- a journey of around 800 km (500 miles) -- when the accident occurred. At this stage in the investigation, Sarafov said officials were exploring two possible causes of the accident. ""One is a human error of the bus driver, the second is a sudden technical malfunction, which led to the accident,"" he said, according to BNT. BNT reported that Rashkov added: ""There is a guardrail here, which was simply taken away, which means that most likely for some reason the bus went to the right in the direction of travel and came into contact with the guardrail, which was simply destroyed. We heard all sorts of versions, including a fuel leak. I hope it will be clarified very soon and the colleagues from the investigation will do their job.""Authorities will also be investigating the stretch of highway where the accident occurred, which is prone to traffic incidents, according to BNT. 'Great grief'In front of the Ismail Qemali elementary school in Skopje, pupils cried after hearing news that five of their schoolmates, all from one family, had been killed, Reuters reported.""Ergin was my friend. He was a very good boy. Very nice. I am so sorry that they died,"" Blerim Bushi, 11, told Reuters.In Sofia, Adnan Yasharovski, 45, said his 16-year-old daughter Zuleikha called him to say she had survived the crash, and he traveled to see her in hospital.""She was crying. Her hands were burnt but otherwise fine,"" he told Reuters outside the hospital. ""She didn't say much, she was crying and she was in shock. I only saw her through the door as due to COVID, they did not let me into the room.""Some relatives gathered outside the Besa Trans agency in Skopje, whose Facebook page advertised twice-weekly trips to Istanbul, and which Yasharovski said ran the trip. The office was closed and its representatives could not be reached for comment.""This is a huge tragedy,"" North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev told reporters in Sofia and expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims. Zaev said the passengers were all from North Macedonia but appeared to include a Serbian citizen and a Belgian citizen. It was unclear whether the two were among the victims or injured.Zaev said he had spoken to one of the seven survivors who told him the passengers were sleeping when they were woken by the sound of an explosion.He said people sitting at the back of the bus were able to break a window and jump out.Zaev said the passengers were from various communities in North Macedonia, a country of 2 million that borders Bulgaria and is home to an ethnic Albanian minority.In Skopje, ethnic Albanian Osman, 31, told Reuters he had come to the office of the travel agency with his brother and sister seeking information about their parents.""We do not know if they were on the bus that crashed or not. We have no information about them. The agency is not answering the phone. Perhaps we will need to go to Bulgaria,"" he said.Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka said the passengers were from North Macedonia's ethnic Albanian community.""Great grief for the 45 lost lives of Albanians from Northern Macedonia during the tragic accident in Bulgaria,"" he said on Twitter. Bulgarian officials have launched an investigation into the incident, state media reported. ",2
223,"Paris (CNN)France's prime minister has tested positive for Covid-19, forcing five Belgian ministers to also go into self-isolation after meeting with the French politician Monday.Prime Minister Jean Castex, who is fully vaccinated, tested positive for the virus after returning to France from a visit with ministers in Brussels, his office confirmed to CNN.On his return from Belgium, Castex learned his 11-year-old daughter had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The Prime Minister then also tested positive and is self-isolating.His Belgium counterpart, Prime Minister Alexander de Croo, along with four other ministers, are now self- isolating following their meeting, according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBF.Castex is not experiencing any symptoms and was feeling good when the positive test came back Monday night, BFMTV reported.Despite being a ""contact case"" -- a person who had contact with someone else with the coronavirus -- multiple times before and his wife catching the disease, Castex had until now never caught the disease himself.The positive test results come as Europe battles a surge in Covid-19 cases that has pushed the continent back to the epicenter of the pandemic, causing governments to toughen restrictions and sparking violent protests from citizens.Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Brussels on Sunday over tougher government restrictions, with police firing water cannons and tear gas after the peaceful demonstration turned violent. The clashes near the European Commission headquarters came after Belgium on Wednesday tightened its coronavirus restrictions -- including broadening mask use and working from home -- amid surging cases.Neighboring France is also experiencing a rise in Covid-19 infection rates, though President Emmanuel Macron has said a lockdown of the unvaccinated is ""not necessary"" given the country's use of a ""health pass"" to access a wide variety of establishments.Elsewhere Austria on Monday became the first European Union country to go back into full lockdown this autumn amid a record number of cases. Last week Austria's seven-day incidence rate passed 1,000 per 1000,000 inhabitants for the first time during the pandemic, according to the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES).Austria now plans to become the first European nation to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for all eligible people from February 1, according to its Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.In a desperate attempt to encourage people to get their jabs, Austria's public broadcaster ORF said Monday it is offering a ""vaccination lottery"" to eligible residents -- with prizes including a family house, an electric car and smart TVs.Austria is not alone. Neighboring Germany is also battling record case numbers, particularly in its eastern states where health officials have warned overstretched hospitals could soon run out of beds for intensive care patients.Germany's Health Minister, Jens Spahn, didn't mince his words on Monday as he urged people to get vaccinated. Spahn told a press conference in Berlin he was certain that by the end of this winter, everyone in Germany would be ""vaccinated, recovered or dead,"" in relation to the Delta variant. The country now plans to introduce targeted Covid-19 restrictions on the unvaccinated.Even Ireland, which has one of Europe's highest vaccination rates -- with around 90% of eligible people immunized -- has not been spared the continent's surge in cases. Last week the country imposed a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs as it faces a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections.While the European Union as a whole has been a world leader on inoculations -- more than 76% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the ECDC -- the rollout has been extremely unequal across the bloc. On the eastern side, Romania and Bulgaria have fully vaccinated only 43% and 29% of their adults, respectively.A CNN team last week witnessed dozens of bodies in black plastic bags piled up in corridors of one hospital in Bucharest as the facility struggled with the influx of deaths caused by the virus.Medical workers and officials in Romania attribute the low vaccination rate to a variety of factors, including suspicion of the authorities, deeply held religious beliefs, and a flood of misinformation surging through social media.Protests turn violent  Fresh Covid-19 restrictions sparked violent protests across some European cities at the weekend, as many citizens face the prospect of their second Christmas under lockdown. Along with Brussels, rioting broke out at The Hague on Saturday over the Dutch government's new coronavirus measures. Video from the scene shows riot police deploying water cannons and charging groups of demonstrators.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Monday denounced the rioters as ""idiots"" who are using new Covid-19 restrictions as an excuse for violence.Elsewhere, an estimated 40,000 people also on Saturday crowded the streets of Vienna in the country's biggest coronavirus-related protest to date.In the Croatian city of Zagreb, around 15,000 people on Saturday demonstrated against the government's coronavirus measures.And on the same night, France sent dozens of elite police and counter-terrorism officers to its Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, following looting and arson in defiance of an overnight curfew.",2
224," (CNN)Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's willful manipulation of migrants, enabling their easy passage to and through his country toward the border of the European Union, is a classic assault on democracy by an autocrat who knows that any attempt to fight back risks undermining the bloc's sacred values.Lukashenko denies the condemnation made by the G7 group of the world's wealthiest democracies that he is orchestrating ""irregular migration"" in an ""aggressive and exploitative"" campaign -- just as he rejects the European Union's accusation that his re-election as president last year, his sixth consecutive five-year term, was a sham.Not for nothing is the aging autocrat known outside of Belarus as Europe's last dictator.For much of this month, the world watched as weary migrants, some with small children and mainly from the Middle East, were coaxed and coerced in freezing conditions to a forest border with the EU. Their rising anger at not being allowed to cross erupted at times as they hurled volleys of rocks at Polish border guards who eventually spewed water cannon fire back at them.In a revealing interview with CNN last week, Lukashenko's foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, exposed the psychology behind his boss's decision to launch a frontal attack on Europe's borders. ""Belarus has shown the dark side of the European democracy,"" he claimed.US President Joe Biden made it an early theme of his term in office, that democracy is under attack. ""We're at an inflection point,"" he told an audience in Germany in February. ""We must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That, in my view, is our galvanizing mission.""But how to deliver on that mission is something that has yet to be mastered. Biden promised a ""summit of democracies"" ""early"" in his presidency, it is due to take place next month, although details are sketchy.  Biden's leverage is waning among allies, due to diplomatic missteps such as the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan and the AUKUS security pact with Australia and the UK that marginalized France. Meanwhile, autocrats like Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin appear to be exploiting the opportunity to divide, discourage and sow dissent in the democracies closest to them, in Europe.When Belarusian foreign minister Makei told CNN that: ""Poland has violated all the possible international legal laws and democratic values,"" he turned logic on its head by ignoring Lukashenko's autocratic practices, such as what some governments condemned as the illegal ""hijacking"" of a commercial airliner that was diverted to Minsk, and arresting a Belarus opposition activist who was on board.Cynically crying wolf, while wilfully ignoring their own violations is a convenience that autocracies routinely use to cover their tracks. On the face of it, how can the EU that champions human rights turn its back on migrants, less still turn water cannons on them? Human Rights groups have criticized Poland for preventing journalists from having access to the border region, and for allegedly pushing migrants who had successfully made it across the razor wire fence back into Belarus.  It is the caring side of democracy, that values human rights and decency, that Biden and others fear autocracies exploit. At one point last week, Lukashenko's government proposed that Germany should take in 2,000 migrants and Belarus would handle the rest.According to Lukashenko's foreign minister, both his boss and Putin were pushing Merkel into some sort of deal. ""It was President Putin who tried to contribute to the settlement of this crisis. He had conversations with Chancellor Merkel, he had conversations with President Lukashenko and as a result of these conversations, the phone calls between Merkel and Lukashenko were organized.""Whatever the detail of those conversations, Merkel and her EU partners saw through the ruse and refused to play ball. Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer later said firmly: ""We will not take in refugees. We will not bow to the pressure and say: 'We are taking refugees into European countries,' because this would mean implementing the very basis of this perfidious strategy."" This, it turns out, is not ""the dark side of the European democracy,"" as Makei claims, but the EU's reality check on what it sees as Lukashenko's lies.But will that matter for Lukashenko and Putin? Of course not. They thrive in a hybrid of hubris and confusion where doubt replaces certainty, and besmirching democracy's moral purpose is a victory in and of itself.Exploiting democracyWhile the fabricated crisis has -- so far -- failed to divide the EU, little of what's happened is a waste for the two autocrats, in that it helps prop up their own illegitimate rule. For their home audiences, the whipped-up confection of half truths about alleged mistreatment by border guards and their water cannons is enough to mislead some people into believing that the other side is no better than them.Lukashenko is exploiting democracy's core value -- compassion -- by weaponizing migrant trauma to turn the EU's moral strength to vulnerability. Europe's real weakness, that he appears to assess, is not its physical borders but its principles. But the real pernicious injury of Lukashenko's ruses is inflicted on the heart of democracy itself. To fight off his assault on democracy, the EU is forced into taking a firm stand and rejecting the 2,000 migrants. It is logical, but only borderline moral. It stoops toward Lukashenko's level and treats those desperate people as pawns.It is this often complicated issue that Biden wants us to explore by illuminating what democracy has at stake in the fight ahead.Inside the European Union, the main effect of Lukashenko's machinations will be to risk raising the specter of migrants at the border even beyond the pre-existing vexing reality -- a situation that has already fueled populist nationalism.At his inaugural address Biden used the word democracy five times in his introduction, and 11 times during his whole speech. It was at the forefront of his mind as he spoke at the spot where, just two weeks earlier, the United States' first attempted coup had unfolded.  Looking out on Washington's flag-strewn Mall, his words broadcast into millions of living rooms and autocrats' offices around the world, Biden warned: ""We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile."" It has become even clearer since then that democracy's trials are far from over, both in the United States and around the world. Now, leaders must convert their well-meaning words into actions.",2
225,"Bucharest, Romania (CNN)""It's relentless -- relentless,"" sighed nurse Claudiu Ionita, standing in front of a line of gurneys in Bucharest University Hospital's morgue. On each gurney lay a body inside a black plastic bag.  The morgue has a capacity for 15 bodies, but on the day CNN visited, it had received 41. The excess bodies filled the corridor outside, while wails echoed from within the morgue. A woman had been allowed inside for a final glimpse of her father.  Bucharest University Hospital is the Romanian capital's largest medical facility treating Covid-19 patients and is struggling through the country's fourth wave, its worst yet.     ""I never thought, when I started this job, that I would live through something like this,"" said Ionita. ""I never thought such a catastrophe could happen, that we'd end up sending whole families to their graves."" Several floors above, all the beds but one in the hospital's now-expanded intensive care units were full. A nurse was changing the sheets on the one vacant bed -- empty, because the person who occupied it now lay in the morgue. Romania has one of Europe's lowest vaccination rates. Just under 36% of the population has been vaccinated, even though the country's vaccination campaign got off to a good start last December.  Medical workers and officials attribute this low vaccination rate to a variety of factors, including suspicion of the authorities, deeply held religious beliefs, and a flood of misinformation surging through social media.  When Dr. Alexandra Munteanu, 32, arrived for duty at one of Bucharest's vaccination centers after an overnight shift in hospital, she found turnout was low. She's perplexed that the gravity of the disease just doesn't seem to have sunk in. ""There are lots of doctors, myself included, who work with Covid patients, and we are trying to tell people this disease actually exists,"" she said.   One of the country's most vocal and high-profile anti-vaxxers is Diana Sosoaca, a member of the Romanian Senate. In one of her many public stunts she tried to block people from entering a vaccine center in her constituency in the northeast of the country.  ""If you love your children, stop the vaccinations,"" she says in a video clip on her Facebook page. ""Don't kill them!""  The vaccines on offer in Romania have been extensively tested for use in children and have proven to be safe and effective, but that hasn't stopped her and others from spreading wild rumors on social media and local television.     Officials and medical personnel are exasperated that public figures have done so much to undermine their efforts.  ""Look at the reality,"" said Col. Dr. Valeriu Gheorghita, an army doctor who runs the national vaccination campaign. ""We have our intensive care units full of patients. We have lots of new cases. We have, unfortunately, hundreds of deaths every day. So this is the reality. And more than 90% of patients who died were unvaccinated.""  In Bucharest, a huge banner has gone up, covering half the façade of a building on a major boulevard. ""They're suffocating. They're begging us. They're regretting,"" are the words printed in massive black letters above black-and-white photographs of medics struggling over Covid patients in an intensive care unit.  Down below, few passers-by glance up at the poster, and even fewer cared to share their thoughts with CNN. Soon, however, that banner will go up in other major cities in the country.   ""There's manipulation,"" said a woman who gave her name only as Claudia, adding: ""Some people don't believe in the vaccines."" Mayor: 'It's not a safe vaccine'Nowhere is that suspicion more apparent than in the countryside, where Covid-19 vaccination rates plummet to about half of those in urban areas.   Suceava County, an hour's flight northeast of Bucharest, has the lowest overall vaccination rate in the country.   Here, the manager of the main hospital, Dr. Alexandru Calancea, 40, talks about the particularity of this region, where he was born and bred.   ""This county is very religious. This is an area that has a strong religious tradition, and a lot of religious people. [...] Very few [priests] are pro-vaccine, and I definitely know some who are anti-vax. Most of them choose not to say anything, either for or against. We have proof, from the hospital, from patients who come from the same religious communities, where their priest, or their pastor, has advised them to not get vaccinated, just like that.""  Just outside Suceava, in the village of Bosanci, such a pastor also serves as the village mayor. Neculai Miron has been one of the most vocal anti-vax public figures in the country, and today is no different. ""We're not against vaccination, but we want to verify it, to satisfy our worries, because there have been many side effects,"" he told CNN. ""We don't think that the vaccine components are very safe. It's not a safe vaccine.""  The medical data doesn't sway him, and neither does the local GP, whom he took the CNN team to see.   Dr. Daniela Afadaroaie administers the vaccine to about 10 people every other day, using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The latest official records show that just under 11% of the village was vaccinated as of early November 2021. While she talked about the situation in the village, the mayor, Miron, hovered around the doctor's desk, peering down at the papers on her desk to see who had been vaccinated.  ""When are you going to get vaccinated, Mr. Mayor?"" asked Afadaroaie, laughing.   ""I don't need to get vaccinated,"" he shot back. ""I'm perfectly healthy."" The doctor's explanation that the vaccine helps keep you that way fell on deaf ears.   Pastor: 'I believe what I see, rather than what I hear'In rural villages like this, poverty and lack of education, together with local leaders' personal influence and traditional religious beliefs, can make for a deadly combination. But the local Pentecostal pastor, Dragos Croitoru, insisted he was unaware of any deaths from Covid-19 in the parish. ""Here in the church, we don't have any cases of people who are sick with coronavirus. We have a zero percent mortality rate, I don't know anyone who's died of coronavirus here in our parish. And I believe what I see, rather than what I hear,"" he said.   Despite hearing from CNN about the bodies of Covid-19 victims filling the morgue at Bucharest University Hospital, Croitoru was unconvinced. ""Bucharest is bigger than Bosanci, as far as I know,"" he chuckled. ""We haven't had any dead. Maybe we've had a few people who have been ill in the village, yes, as far as I know, yes. But the mortality rate in our church has been zero.""    The mortality rate is certainly high elsewhere in this mostly rural county. Suceava ranked third highest in Covid-19 mortality rates for the whole country as of early November, according to figures from the Public Health Unit, which monitors deaths.   A corner of the main cemetery in Suceava, the county seat that's about 10 minutes from Bosanci, is full of freshly dug graves. In the cemetery's chapel, a service is underway.  On the hill behind the chapel, mourners gather for a funeral. Nearby, another grave is being prepared.   The wooden crosses over each new grave don't indicate the cause of death, so it's unclear how many died from the virus. A man working on one of the graves, however, said the number of people being buried of late was far higher than usual.  ""Eternal regrets,"" reads a ribbon draped across one of the graves.  Back in the morgue of the Bucharest University Hospital, a medic hammered a nail into a wooden coffin. A colleague sprayed the coffin with disinfectant.   For those who die of Covid, there will be no open-casket funerals.  ""The vaccine means the difference between life and death,"" said Ionita, the nurse. ""People should understand that. Maybe in their last hour they should understand that.""For those shrouded in the black body bags before him, it is already too late. ",2
226," (CNN)Portugal shut down its last remaining coal plant over the weekend, ending the use of the polluting material for electricity generation and becoming the fourth country in the European Union to do so.Environmental group Zero said in a statement the Pego plant in central Portugal had been the country's second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, adding that ""freeing ourselves from the biggest source of greenhouse gases was a momentous day for Portugal"".The move comes nine years before Portugal's targeted end of the use of the fossil fuel by 2030.Belgium, Austria and Sweden are the other three European countries to have already stopped using coal for power generation.Although a hefty 60%-70% of its electricity comes from renewable sources, Portugal still relies heavily on imported fossil fuels to meet overall energy needs.There are concerns the Pego plant, run by the privately held group Tejo Energia, might now be converted to burn wood pellets.""The challenge now is to ensure utilities do not make the mistake of replacing coal with fossil gas, or unsustainable biomass,"" said Kathrin Gutmann, campaign director at Europe Beyond Coal.""Ditching coal only to switch to the next worst fuel is clearly not an answer,"" said Zero's president Francisco Ferreira. ""Instead, the focus should be on rapidly upscaling our renewable energy capacity in wind and solar.""A draft document seen by Reuters in June showed the EU was considering tightening rules on whether wood-burning energy could be classified as renewable.

227," (CNN)Octopuses, crabs and lobsters are capable of experiencing pain or suffering, according to a review commissioned by the UK government, which has added the creatures to a list of sentient beings to be given protection under new animal welfare laws.Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.The report by experts at the London School of Economics looked at 300 scientific studies to evaluate evidence of sentience, and they concluded that cephalopods (such as octopuses, squid and cuttlefish) and decapods (such as crabs, lobsters and crayfish) should be treated as sentient beings. Vertebrates, animals with a backbone, are already classified as sentient in new animal welfare legislation currently under debate in the United Kingdom. ""The Animal Welfare Sentience Bill provides a crucial assurance that animal wellbeing is rightly considered when developing new laws. The science is now clear that decapods and cephalopods can feel pain and therefore it is only right they are covered by this vital piece of legislation,"" said Animal Welfare Minister Lord Zac Goldsmith in a statement.The Bill, which isn't yet law, will establish an Animal Sentience Committee, which will issue reports on how well government decisions have taken into account the welfare of sentient animals. It is part of a wider government Action Plan for Animal Welfare.The report said lobsters and crabs shouldn't be boiled alive and included best practices for the transport, stunning and slaughter of decapods and cephalopods.Learning more about cephalopods and decapodsThe report used eight different ways to measure sentience including learning ability, possession of pain receptors, connections between pain receptors and certain brain regions, response to anesthetics or analgesics, and behaviors including balancing threat against opportunity for reward and protection against injury or threat. It found ""very strong"" evidence of sentience in octopods and ""strong"" evidence in most crabs. For other animals in these two groups, such as squid, cuttlefish and lobsters they found the evidence was substantial but not strong. However, the report said these varying degrees of evidence reflected disparities in the amount of attention different animals have received from scientists. ""Scientific attention has gravitated towards some (animals) rather than others for reasons of practical convenience (e.g. which animals can be kept well in labs) and geography (e.g. which species are available where a lab is located). Because of this situation, we think it would be inappropriate to limit protection to specific orders of cephalopod, or to specific infraorders of decapod,"" the report said. The recent Netflix documentary ""My Octopus Teacher"" showcased the unique abilities of octopuses. The brain structure of octopuses is very different from that of humans, but it has some of the same functions as mammal brains, such as learning abilities, including being able to solve problems, and possibly the ability to dream.

228," (CNN)Protests in European countries against new Covid-19 restrictions turned violent over the weekend as cases continue to rise in the continent.Rioting broke out at The Hague on Saturday over the Dutch government's new coronavirus measures. Video from the scene shows riot police deploying water cannons and charging groups of demonstrators.  The Netherlands re-entered three weeks of partial lockdown last Saturday and is now planning to ban unvaccinated people from entering some venues. Five police officers were injured during the clashes at The Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks, police said in a statement. ""The group started fires, committed destruction, assaulted motorists and threw rocks and heavy fireworks at police officers,"" police said, confirming that 19 arrests were made.They added that one demonstrator threw a stone through the window of an ambulance, which was transporting a patient to a hospital.Thousands of protesters attended a largely peaceful march in the capital Amsterdam on Saturday. Dutch public broadcaster, NOS also reported rioting in the town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province. The protests follow violent clashes on Friday night in the port city of Rotterdam, during which police were forced to fire gunshots to disperse the crowd, and 51 people were arrested. Elsewhere, an estimated 40,000 people on Saturday crowded the streets of Vienna in the country's biggest coronavirus-related protest to date. Police tried to de-escalate the protest and when the ""mood was about to tip,"" they stopped fining those not wearing facemasks, Franz Eigner, Vice President of the Vienna police said during a press conference on Sunday. Some police officers had ""unidentified liquid"" sprayed on them, and protesters were trying to blind a helicopter with a laser, Eigner said. A small number of protesters were ""extremely prone to violence,"" Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said during the press conference, which he associated with the ""right-wing extremist scene.""Austria will re-introduce a nationwide partial lockdown on Monday and make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory from February next year.  More than 1,400 police officers were deployed across the country to maintain public order, according to a police statement. Pepper spray was used in one ""heated"" protest in central Vienna, the police statement added. France sent dozens of elite police and counter-terrorism officers to its Caribbean island of Guadeloupe Saturday following looting and arson overnight in defiance of an overnight curfew. The island's prefect on Friday introduced the stay-at-home order after protests against the vaccine pass spiralled into violence the previous night. The interior ministry said 31 people had been arrested. Around 15,000 people on Saturday protested in Zagreb against the Croatian government's coronavirus measures. From Monday, only people with Covid passports can enter government and public buildings in Croatia. ",2
229," (CNN)It was clear who the losers were in the dispute between Poland and Belarus. The thousands of migrants who became stranded on the border in freezing conditions had their dreams of a new future in Europe dashed, and some are now being repatriated to their home countries. But for Poland's government, the crisis helped to divert attention from a series of uncomfortable issues.The nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), which won an outright majority in 2015, has seen its grip on parliamentary power weaken in the years since. It is also roiled in conflict with the European Commission over the rule of law and faces wide opposition, especially in urban areas, to its position on cultural issues.Earlier this month, the death of a pregnant Polish woman reignited debate over the country's near total ban on abortion, with protesters again taking to the streets.Set against this backdrop, the drama that played out on the country's eastern border with Belarus -- while unsolicited by Poland and serious for all involved -- can be seen as a helpful distraction for the ruling PiS. ""This migration crisis is quite useful from the perspective of the domestic political agenda for the party because they are at the moment in trouble. And they have been in trouble for quite a time already, with the parliamentary majority becoming slimmer and slimmer,"" Piotr Buras, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations' Warsaw office, told CNN. The right-wing party's ruling coalition narrowly controlled the lower house, the Sejm, until the summer, when three MPs defected, costing PiS its formal majority and forcing it to rely on the support of independents. The party had already lost control of Poland's upper house in 2019 elections, and President Andrzej Duda, backed by PiS, only narrowly won a second term last year.Meanwhile, rising inflation is causing financial pain for many in Poland, and polling indicates support for the government has dropped in recent weeks, said Buras.""I don't want to play down the situation because it is risky and serious, quite a difficult political situation because it involves a security conflict and a humanitarian crisis... but there is of course also an attempt to capitalize politically on this crisis,"" he said.Judy Dempsey, editor of the Strategic Europe blog for the thinktank Carnegie Europe, agreed that the crisis had been ""playing out very well"" for the ruling party.Support for the government had fallen, she said, amid protests over the death of the pregnant woman. But Dempsey added: ""With this whole crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border, Law and Justice now is seen as a champion of protecting Polish sovereignty and, of course, protecting Europe.""State of emergencyThe decision by Poland's government -- which also opposed taking in refugees during the 2015 migrant crisis -- to hold firm on border security appears to have won wide domestic support. Meanwhile, opposition politicians are in a difficult position because they cannot say they don't want to protect the border, Buras said, although they have criticized some of the measures taken by the government.Warsaw has tried to keep the crisis from view, blocking the Polish side of the border to journalists, aid workers and doctors amid an extended state of emergency. That has not always worked to the Polish government's benefit: Some of the most compelling images of the crisis, such as Polish border forces using water cannons on desperate migrants, were captured from the Belarusian side of the border, where international journalists were able to operate. The government is now trying to pass legislation that would give it new powers when the state of emergency expires next month.The crisis has also forced the EU to rally behind for Poland at a time of increasingly bitter dispute between the European Commission and Poland over the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.Late last month, the European Union's top court ordered Poland to pay a daily fine of €1 million ($1.2 million) for failing to suspend a disciplinary chamber for judges that the bloc says breaches EU law, just the latest in a series of conflicts.Now, the European Commission and key European powers are speaking out in support of Poland as the defender of the bloc's eastern border. In a call Wednesday with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany stands in ""full solidarity"" with Poland over the border crisis, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted.Members of PiS have openly expressed their hope that the European Commission ""will show more understanding for Poland and would apply a lighter approach to the rule of law issues because of this crisis on the border,"" Buras said. Nonetheless, the political situation is ""very volatile,"" he added, and the Polish government risks finding itself hemmed in by its fierce rhetoric on border security and unable to back down.If the crisis abates, with migrants repatriated or no longer on the border, the extent to which the Polish government continues to benefit from the nationalistic fervor it has whipped up will depend in part on how effective the opposition is, Dempsey said.Another factor to consider is those within Poland who do not share the government's desire to keep the migrants out, she said.""We mustn't forget that there are civil society movements and nongovernmental organizations and decent people who want these migrants treated properly, (want) access to the border to give them help,"" she said. ""Maybe this will backfire. The Polish government kept a lid on the reporting and didn't allow humanitarian agencies or the media to go to the border. So if this crisis does weaken, no doubt Law and Justice will try to keep the nationalist fervor going, but it cannot be sustained.""EU backs Poland on bordersThe clear losers in this crisis are the migrants, mostly from the Middle East, who paid large sums to traffickers on the false promise of an easy way to cross illegally into Poland and travel on deeper into Europe in search of a better life.An unlucky few have died of cold in the freezing forests along Belarus' border. Others have opted to return home having gained nothing except debt; an Iraqi Airways evacuation flight left Thursday from Minsk carrying more than 400 Iraqis back to the cities of Erbil and Baghdad.Belarusian border guards moved some migrants to shelter in a warehouse after tensions on the border flared into skirmishes Tuesday. The remainder followed on Thursday, leaving behind only remnants of the makeshift camp by the Bruzgi-Kuznica crossing where 2,000 or more people had been camped out.Lukashenko's spokeswoman, Natalya Eismont, said Thursday that about 7,000 migrants were in Belarus. Those who remain insist on a humanitarian corridor being opened to Western Europe, primarily to Germany, Eismont said, according to Belarus state news agency BelTA.According to the Polish Border Guard, there have been more than 35,000 attempts to cross illegally into Poland from Belarus since the beginning of August. Seven people had been found dead on the Polish side of the border as of Thursday.Poland has been criticized by international aid organizations who say it is breaching international law by pushing asylum seekers who make it over the border back into Belarus, instead of accepting their applications for international protection. Poland stands by its actions, however, saying they are legal.Meanwhile, some who have made it over the border into Poland have alleged brutal treatment at the hands of Belarusian security forces.Western officials have accused Belarusian strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko of manufacturing the crisis to destabilize the bloc as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses. The unanswered question is what Belarus now stands to gain from the standoff on the EU's eastern frontier.EU leaders agreed Monday to impose a new package of sanctions on Belarus targeting ""everyone involved"" in facilitating the situation on Poland's border, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said.The EU has also made clear its assistance will extend to humanitarian aid and help for migrants to return home -- but not to resettlement within its borders. In a phone call Wednesday with Lukashenko, Merkel underlined the need to ensure ""humanitarian care and return opportunities"" for the people affected, her spokesman said.Germany's caretaker Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has insisted that ""the EU will not be blackmailed by criminals like Lukashenko"" and says the bloc wants to find out the migrants' countries of origin in order to repatriate their citizens.Dempsey is critical of the EU response, saying the bloc failed to agree on a common, united policy on migration after the 2015 refugee crisis and is paying the price for it now.This crisis will doubtless be followed by another one, she said. ""Migrants or refugees looking for safety or a better life will be exploited again and the Europeans still will not put together a proper, humane, practical policy -- and pushing up very heavily fortified fences is not a solution.""Fallout for BelarusSome observers have pointed to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the most important ally of Belarus, as being involved in stoking the turmoil. A buildup of Russian military forces near Ukraine's eastern border has deepened concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis.Asked about any threat of war in an interview published Thursday by German newspaper Bild, Morawiecki said he hoped all parties would remain calm, but added that nothing could be ruled out.""Lukashenko and Putin are obviously following a strategy to unsettle the West, to destabilize it. We don't know what else they are planning,"" the Polish Prime Minister told Bild. ""It is also possible that the crisis on the border is only meant to distract from new military attacks that Putin is preparing in Ukraine.""Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday strongly rejected any suggestion that Putin had been using so-called ""hybrid warfare"" tactics in Europe. ""Russia does not wage any hybrid wars. We absolutely rule this out,"" Peskov told journalists.Putin, too, has denied Russian involvement in the Belarus-Poland border crisis. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it. Everyone is trying to impose responsibility on us for any reason and for no reason at all,"" Putin told state broadcaster Russia 24.Lukashenko's government has also repeatedly rejected claims it manufactured the border crisis.Interviewed by CNN on Thursday, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said accusations by European nations that Belarus had orchestrated the standoff were a ""false assessment of the situation."" He instead blamed the EU, saying migrants had heard about the ""privileges"" neighboring EU countries had offered ""migrants from Belarus"" -- a reference to opposition and dissidents who have fled Minsk since disputed elections last year.Radoslaw Sikorski, a member of the European Parliament and former Polish foreign minister and defense minister, told CNN's Hala Gorani that Lukashenko's gamble over the migrant crisis could backfire.""Lukashenko is trying to repeat what President Erdogan of Turkey did, except that Turkey really had millions of Syrian refugees, and it really was a huge drain on Turkey's resources, and that EU agreed to pay some of that cost. Mr. Lukashenko has imported his migrants on purpose,"" said Sikorski, who is also a senior fellow at Harvard.While Lukashenko would see the fact that he is receiving calls from Merkel as ""a success for him,"" Sikorski said, the crisis could eventually cost him more than any fleeting legitimacy he has gained. Actions taken by the EU and Middle East governments to stem the flow of migrants into Belarus are starting to have an effect and only small numbers are getting through to the EU, Sikorski said. ""I think, eventually, Lukashenko will have to conclude that it's a bigger problem for him than for the European Union,"" he said.",2
230," (CNN)Most of the 250 permanent residents of a volcanic Italian island have been told to evacuate after levels of carbon dioxide in the air spiked dangerously, causing respiratory problems to people and their pets.Carbon dioxide levels around the volcanic island of Vulcano in the Aeolian archipelago off the north coast of Sicily have risen from 80 tons to 480 tons, effectively reducing the amount of oxygen in the air, according to the Italian National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV). The gas levels started rising noticeably on October 21, when residents started reporting trouble breathing and health issues with their pets, which are often affected by decreased oxygen levels before humans.Marco Giorgianni, the mayor of Lipari, which includes all seven of the islands in the Aeolian archipelago, signed an ordinance ordering the evacuation of the port area and designating a ""red zone"" where non-researchers or non-civil protection officials are prohibited from staying. In so-called ""yellow zones,"" people can remain but will have to stay in the upper floors of their homes.The ordinance also prohibits all non-resident visitors and tourists from the island for one month. In a message on the Lipari Comune's Facebook page, Giorgianni explained Sunday that the evacuation is not because of the threat of an imminent eruption, but because of the dangerous emission of gases. ""The activity of the volcano gives us reason in this moment to pay attention even if almost all of the data points to a condition of stability,"" he said, referring to volcanic activity. ""The data that motivated my ordinance is the increasing gas emissions."" He added that authorities had been tracking gas emissions for the last month and they had risen to a level that is potentially dangerous for humans, especially at night when they are sleeping. ""My citizens must reside where the air is most secure and healthy in this region,""  he said.According to INGV's Palermo and Catania-Etneo Observatory website, four geochemical stations to measure CO2 from the soil are now operating. The observatory has also installed seven new seismic stations (six on Vulcano and one on Lipari) to supplement those already in place. A high-definition thermal cam has also been installed to monitor soil temperatures.According to the ordinance, residents will be given monthly allowances of €400 for single households, €500 for two-person households, €700 for three person households and €800 for households with more than four people to offset costs in finding alternative accommodation.Vulcano -- which is named after Vulcan, the god of fire, and from which the English word volcano is derived -- last erupted on March 22, 1890, according to the INGV.",2
231," (CNN)A 70-year-old man sustained a ""serious leg injury"" in southwestern France on Saturday after an encounter with a bear, according to a statement from the southwestern prefecture of Ariège. The hunter, who had been pursuing wild boars, was assisted by the high mountain gendarmerie team and promptly taken to a local hospital ""in a worrying condition,"" the statement said. A spokesperson from the French Gendarmerie was unable to confirm to CNN whether the hunter shot the bear, though the statement from the prefecture of Ariège read that gendarmes had ""located a bear carcass below the place where the victim was found, which could accredit the thesis of an accident linked to the encounter between the man and the animal.""A judicial investigation has since unfolded to examine the circumstances of the accident. The largest carnivore in Europe, brown bears had nearly disappeared from France until the French government began a program to reintroduce them in the Pyrenees mountains in 1996. That year, French authorities started to import bears from Slovenia belonging to the same species as Pyrenean bears and release them in the southwestern mountain chain.According to a report from the Brown Bear Network, part of the French Office for Biodiversity, there were 64 brown bears in the Pyrenees last year, all descendants of Slovenian bears reintroduced over the years.Their presence leads to increasing tensions with local farmers, because of the threat they pose to their livestock. The report shows Ariège is the French department that has the highest number of bears, and where the most bear-related damage has been measured last year -- with 329 bear-related attacks in 2020. ",2
232," (CNN)Thousands of people have been stranded at the border between Poland and Belarus for months, trapped at the center of an intensifying geopolitical dispute.The migrants -- most of whom are from the Middle East and Asia, and who are hoping to travel on from Poland deeper into Europe -- have been gathering on the Belarusian side of the Kuznica border crossing in terrible conditions. Authorities closed the crossing last week, and later cleared makeshift camps where thousands had gathered. But the ramification of the border crisis will continue to be felt in Europe and beyond, with uncertainty over what comes next.Here's what you need to know about the crisis that's unfolding on Europe's frontier.Migrants are facing dire conditionsCharities said people stuck in the border area have battled freezing weather and lacked food and medical attention, with reports of beatings and grueling conditions emerged. Polish police said Monday that around 3,500 people had gathered near the Kuznica crossing. On Friday, Belarusian border officials told CNN that 200 children and 600 women were among an estimated 2,000 people massed near the border crossing. Some of those are only babies or toddlers.One Syrian asylum-seeker, who recently arrived in Poland after his third attempt at crossing the border from Belarus, told CNN that on arriving at the border, guards caught him and three others in his group. He was beaten up, and suffered facial injuries, a broken nose and bruised ribs. Polish authorities said seven migrants have been found dead on Poland's side of the border, with reports of more deaths in Belarus.The makeshift camps where migrants had been been staying on the Bruzgi-Kuźnica crossing were finally cleared by Belarusian authorities on Thursday, with migrants moved to a nearby warehouse that has been converted into an ad hoc processing center.Although the shelter has offered a reprieve from below-zero temperatures and rough living conditions in the short term, Belarus has yet to lay out what comes next for migrants who flew to Minsk in the hope of making it to Europe, and a better life. Many now fear their new accommodation is just a first step in the deportation process.Since the beginning of November, there have been thousands of recorded border crossing attempts, according to Polish authorities. A spokesperson for Poland's border guards told CNN on Monday that there had been ""forced mass attempts to cross the border"" in Kuznica area by a group of people over the weekend and that the situation was ""very tense and very dangerous."" Last week, Polish border guard representatives told CNN that some of the migrants had been pushed toward the barriers by Belarusian services. Speaking on Monday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Belarus was doing everything to prevent people from accumulating at the border.Polish authorities have detained small numbers of people, allowing only small numbers of people the option of applying for asylum in Poland. Others have been immediately sent back to Belarus.Access to the border area has been tightly restricted. Journalists and aid workers have been blocked from traveling to the area by an exclusion zone.Poland's government is ramping up its nationalist rhetoricPolish President Andrzej Duda visited the border last Thursday in a show of solidarity with the military, police and border guards. Earlier in the day, Duda addressed thousands of Poles who marched through Warsaw to celebrate Independence Day.In a speech with nationalistic references in support of the government's strict policy of keeping the border with Belarus closed to migrants, he said: ""We have always been, we are and we will be part of a Europe based on Christian values, which are also the foundations of our tradition and culture.""""The time has come when you need to defend your homeland. But we need to guard its borders more than before,"" Duda said, adding: ""It must be done with dedication, with sleepless nights, in coldness, in hardship, in a very ungrateful situation to which we were forced by the hybrid actions of the Belarusian regime against Poland and against the European Union.""Humanitarian groups are accusing Poland's ruling party of violating the international right to asylum by pushing people back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Under article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries. Poland says its actions are legal.A larger political crisis is brewingLukashenko has been accused of manufacturing the migrant crisis on the border by the prime ministers of neighboring Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, leading Poland to adopt a bill in October for the construction of a wall along its border with Belarus.NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also pointed the finger at Belarus, saying last week that ""Belarus using migrants as a hybrid tactic is unacceptable.""Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied such claims, instead blaming the West for the crossings and treatment of migrants.Russia, Belarus' largest (and most important) political and economic partner, has defended Minsk's handling of the issue and has denied any involvement in the crisis.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Russia had ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the crisis at the border.Russia underlined its support for the Lukashenko regime by performing joint military exercises over Belarusian airspace last week.On Wednesday, two long-range Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 supersonic long-range bombers practiced ""issues of interaction with ground control points"" with armed forces of both countries, the Russian Ministry of Defense said. On Thursday, they carried out those flights over Belarus' airspace for a second time.The two nations then held joint paratrooper drills near the Polish border on Friday.Meanwhile, Ukraine is also scaling up security around the border with Belarus. On Thursday, it announced it would hold military drills with some 8,500 servicemen and 15 helicopters in an area near its borders with Poland and Belarus to counter a potential migrant crisis.Speaking to ""Axios on HBO"" last week, Stoltenberg said the alliance was closely monitoring ""unusual"" Russian troop movements near the Ukraine border and would be ready to address what may happen.Following talks in Brussels with Ukraine's foreign minister, Stoltenberg said on Monday: ""We again call on Russia to de-escalate, to reduce tensions and be transparent on their military activities in and around Ukraine."" Stoltenberg has promised NATO's ""support"" to Ukraine, which is not a NATO member.The crisis at the Poland-Belarus border is continuing to test a fragile political order, with allegations from the United States on Russia's military buildup deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last Wednesday that the US was ""concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity"" and mentioned the possibility that Russia may be ""attempting to rehash"" its 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Last Friday, Russia said any allegations that it could invade Ukraine were ""empty, groundless escalation of tensions.""Belarus faces new sanctionsEuropean leaders have accused Belarus of manufacturing the migrant crisis on the EU border as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses, a claim the Belarus government has repeatedly denied.In response to the escalation, the United States and the European Union announced new sanctions against Belarus last week. On Monday, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was going to extend sanctions further.""Today we are going to approve a new package of sanctions against Belarusian people responsible for what's happening ... and we are going to launch a framework in order to implement other sanctions to other people, airlines, travel agencies and everybody involved on this illegal push of migrants in our borders,"" he said.The White House's National Security Council said last week the US was preparing ""follow-up sanctions"" designed to hold Belarusian leaders accountable for ""ongoing attacks on democracy, human rights and international norms."" The spokesperson did not specify when the new sanctions would come into place. ""We are deeply concerned by the Lukashenka regime's inhumane actions and strongly condemn their callous exploitation and coercion of vulnerable people,"" the spokesperson said.This is the second round of sanctions announced by the US in recent months. In August, the White House announced a sweeping executive order targeting those in the Belarusian regime involved in the repression of human rights and democracy.The executive order was released on the one-year anniversary of Belarus' election, which sparked widespread protests throughout the country and which the US -- and much of the international community -- declared fraudulent.",2
233," (CNN)Russian rescue dog Monika has a new spring in her step after being fitted with titanium prosthetic legs -- just months after doctors suggested she should be put down because of severe injuries. The operation was conducted by vet Sergei Gorshkov, who is based in the city of Novosibirsk and has fitted 37 animals with prosthetic limbs since 2015 -- although Monika is the first dog to benefit from his work. Two weeks after her operation, the pooch is adjusting well to her new mobility -- and Gorshkov says she will soon be leading a normal life, although he was ""surprised"" by the speed of her recovery.""I don't think we were optimistic about that,"" he told CNN. ""But on the third day she started standing up and walking around the clinic, going from room to room.""However, it wasn't easy getting Monika into the operation room -- she was initially found without her paws in December 2020 by workers in the village of Plastunovskaya, and the volunteers who rescued her suspect she had been abused.Monika was brought into the care of animal rescue volunteers Marina Gapich and Alla Leonkina, based in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where she had her damaged limbs amputated and received a blood transfusion. Gapich told CNN she and Leonkina had ""sleepless nights"" over Monika, and disagreed with veterinary advice to have her euthanized. The two women got in touch with Gorshkov and raised 400,000 Russian rubles (over $5,400) for the operation.Monika's prosthetics then had to be printed by a 3D printer in the town of Troitstk, not far from Moscow and then biocoated at Tomsk Polytechnic University before Gorshkov carried out the procedure. For the vet, much of his work has taken on a new significance during the last 18 months, with the ""pandemic pet"" being especially important to some.""I'm happy to give a new life to the animals since especially now during Covid,"" Gorshkov said. ""People find some consolation in animals and so by treating animals, I treat people.""And Monika has already found her way into the hearts of the volunteers who rescued her. Asked whether the pooch would be staying in Novosibirsk, the answer from Gapich was a definite no.""We are her carers, we are responsible for her!"" she told CNN, adding that she and Leonkina were in touch with a London-based animal behaviorist who might now be consulted on Monika's case.

234," (CNN)Elijah Lewis, a 5-year-old found dead in a Massachusetts state park after being missing for more than a month, died by homicide, officials said Monday. An autopsy found the boy's cause of death ""was determined to be violence and neglect, including facial and scalp injuries, acute fentanyl intoxication, malnourishment and pressure ulcers,"" the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office said in a news release.Elijah's remains were found by state police on October 23 in Ames Nowell State Park in Abington, about 20 miles southeast of Boston. His body was discovered in what investigators referred to as a grave, the attorney general's office said at the time.Elijah's disappearance was brought to the attention of authorities by New Hampshire's Division for Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) on October 14. He wasn't reported missing prior to this time, officials said.Police in Merrimack, New Hampshire, began investigating and were joined by New Hampshire State Police and the New Hampshire Department of Justice, according to the attorney general's office. New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell told CNN affiliate WMUR last month that investigators believe they narrowed down the time frame Elijah went missing back to September 1.Elijah's mother, Danielle Dauphinais, 35, and her boyfriend, Joseph Stapf, 30, were arrested on charges of child endangerment and witness tampering on October 17 and are being held without bond, the attorney general's office said.Witness tampering charges against Dauphinais and Stapf stem from evidence showing the pair allegedly asked people to lie about Elijah's whereabouts and where he was living, knowing child protection services were searching for the boy, the attorney general said in an October statement.CNN has reached out to the attorneys for Dauphinais and Stapf for comment but did not immediately hear back.",2
235," (CNN)There is a common thread between the 1995 acquittal of O.J. Simpson and the 2021 acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse -- a jury and trial consultant named Jo-Ellan Dimitrius.She developed the jury profile in Simpson's case and now, decades later, worked ""hand in hand"" with Rittenhouse's attorneys to help build a profile for the ""right"" juror in his case.""In O.J.'s case because we had done so much pretrial research, we knew that there was a certain demographic that was going to be more open to what our defense was,"" she told CNN.At the time, it was a female African American with a high school education or less, she recalled. In Rittenhouse's case, however, she said, ""We didn't find anything that was predictive.""So, they dug. ""Familiarity with guns was an important thing to explore,"" she told CNN. ""Generally getting a sense if somebody was a supporter of the Second Amendment, supporter of the First Amendment as well."" That included both in real life and from their ""digital footprints"" on social media.""In looking at profiles of jurors, it's looking for individuals who are going to be most receptive to whatever the evidence is that comes out,"" she added.Ahead of the trial, Dimitrius and the Rittenhouse team tested that in the form of three sets of mock jurors.The defense knew video would be paramount, but a central question quickly became whether Rittenhouse would actually testify. ""There were concerns by everyone involved in the case,"" according to Dimitrius, especially given his age and the attention on his every move.""We had three separate groups of twelve mock jurors. One of them saw only the video testimony and the other two saw not only the video testimony but they saw Kyle actually testify,"" said Dimitrius. ""As a result of that it was very, very clear that his story needed to be told about what happened that night.""Mark Richards, defense attorney for Rittenhouse, told CNN, ""He scored much worse [with those who did not hear his story] than the people who did hear his story.""""That was subject to cross examination by a trained ex-prosecutor. And that made the decision, I don't want to say easy, but it made it the right call...he needs to tell his story,"" he added.On November 10, Rittenhouse eventually took the stand in his own defense, at times emotional, describing how August 25, 2020, ended with him killing two people and wounding a third.  According to Dimitrius, the ""perfect juror"" in the Rittenhouse case was someone who was willing ""to listen to what was presented in court and to make their decision based solely on that evidence.""""The rest is history,"" she said.'Very frustrating' jury selection processOut of the 179 prospective jurors who arrived for the Rittenhouse trial, the final 20 needed for trial were whittled down in a day.""Judge (Bruce) Schroeder did not allow us the use of a written questionnaire, juror questionnaire, which is highly unusual in a high-profile case,"" Dimitrius told CNN. ""Number two, he limited the voir dire to an hour apiece...generally to get in the questions you want to ask, that's a very, very short period of time.""The jurors were sorted dozens at a time, and the pace made it difficult at times to keep up with what was actually in play.""It was very frustrating,"" Dimitrius said.She was hired months ahead of the trial and was present during jury selection, jury monitoring, and trial assistance and was often seen sitting next to Wendy Rittenhouse, the defendant's mother.The jurors in the Rittenhouse trial were overwhelmingly White not only in the original pool of 179 prospects but also in the final deciding panel of 12, where there was only one person of color.""It should be reflective of the community in which the trial will be held,"" Dimitrius told CNN. ""I saw the demographic representation very accurate to what Kenosha has.""As of 2019, about 79 percent of Kenosha's population was white, according to the US Census.""I do believe in my heart of hearts that we ended up with a jury that would be very fair,"" Dimitrius said.Rittenhouse faced homicide and reckless endangerment charges for the killings of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, and for shooting at the man commonly known in court as ""jump kick man."" The shootings happened after the police shooting of Jacob Blake sparked protests in Kenosha.During their deliberations, jurors requested to rewatch much of the video evidence of the shootings. In the end, they agreed with Rittenhouse's testimony that he feared for his life and acted in self-defense. He was acquitted of all charges on November 19.After the verdict, lead prosecutor Thomas Binger told the court, ""The jury has represented our community in this trial and has spoken.""Binger, in a statement, said, ""While we are disappointed with the verdict, it must be respected."" The judge praised the jurors, saying he ""couldn't have asked for a better jury.""  Rittenhouse vs. SimpsonThere are undoubtedly many differences between the 1995 OJ Simpson and the 2021 Kyle Rittenhouse murder trials, mainly, as Dimitrius put it, ""back in '95 people remember hopefully that the Internet wasn't front and center.""Another key difference, according to Dimitrius, was the lack of any demographic that was necessarily ""predictive"" in the Rittenhouse case like there was for Simpson.""We learned that African American women with a high school or less education, for whatever reason, they didn't believe that the next step from domestic abuse or domestic violence was necessarily murder,"" she told CNN. ""I couldn't explain it then, I can't explain it now, but for whatever reason they were the ones that were most, sort of open to that component.""At least half of the 12 jurors in the Simpson trial were Black women.That jury eventually acquitted Simpson of charges in the killing of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.The case was dubbed the ""trial of the century"" for its swirling themes of celebrity, race, criminal justice, trust in police and domestic violence. After nearly nine months of proceedings, jurors returned their not guilty verdict in less than four hours.Simpson was later found liable in a civil wrongful death lawsuit brought by the victims' families. On the stand, he denied killing Brown Simpson and Goldman. Dimitrius said one of the key similarities between the trials was the dynamic around the two being televised, including receiving ""important information because people were watching what was going on, on TV and then they may have known somebody, they may have felt compelled to come in to testify.""According to Dimitrius, that included Drew Hernandez as ""one of those people who reached out to us after he saw Richie McGinniss testify. The same thing happened in O.J."" Hernandez was a freelance commentator who was the 10th witness called by the defense during testimony.Hernandez, who shot video of the protests, testified that Rittenhouse tried to deescalate tensions at one point the night of the shooting. He told the jury that Rosenbaum -- the first person to be shot -- was ""physically aggressive"" even before his encounter with Rittenhouse. While jury selection is important in a trial, Dimitrius emphasized, ""I don't change the evidence,"" as she admitted she is not always right and views her position as ""supplemental to a good trial lawyer's experience.""Over her decades long career, she has been involved in many high-profile cases on both the criminal and civil side, including the estate of George Floyd's civil case with the City of Minneapolis, one that ended as one of the largest pretrial settlements in history. Many of the cases she has been involved with are polarizing in nature from Rodney King to Francis Ford Coppola, Kobe Bryant, and more.""What I've seen, particularly in OJ and in Kyle's case, is that sadly there are certain bodies of the public that find it an inconvenient truth if in fact there is an acquittal. And who those people are from trial to trial, issue to issue, is different,"" Dimitrius told CNN.She hopes the public learns from the results of Rittenhouse trial. ""Whether it's Kenosha, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, wherever. I believe everybody has that First Amendment right as well, to protest and let their opinion be known but where it crosses the line is where there's either destruction of property or destruction of life,"" she added.""I hope that there is something learned from these types of cases and that we can move forward as a country and still exercise those constitutional rights we have but also accept the responsibility when they step over the line.""",2
236," (CNN)Criminal charges against a St. Louis County police officer who shot a Black woman were dropped Monday after the victim requested a restorative justice mediation that focuses on repairing the harm caused by an offense. The St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office said Ashley Fountain Hall asked that assault charges be dropped against former Ladue, Missouri, police officer Julia Crews, 39. The charges stemmed from a dispute that took place on April 23, 2019, outside a Schnucks grocery store.   Crews mistakenly drew her firearm instead of using her Taser to restrain Hall and shot her in the torso, leading to critical injuries, the office said. Hall lost part of her spleen and suffers with post-traumatic stress disorder, prosecutors said.   The prosecutor's office said Crews immediately realized she drew her gun when she intended to use her Taser, then administered aid and apologized ""profusely."" Crews, who was captured crying in her booking photo, immediately resigned, and her response to the shooting ""all played a part in the push for mediation,"" the office said.  Hall, who has since recovered, received a $2 million settlement and pushed for a restorative justice program.  The prosecutor's office said Hall and Crews voluntarily participated in a ""successful"" face-to-face meeting with a mediator, Seema Gajwani, the chief of the Restorative Justice Program for Karl Racine, Attorney General for the District of Columbia.  St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell and Lisa Jones, the office's manager of Victim Services, also participated in the process. The method allows an offender to find rehabilitation through reconciliation with the victim.  ""This was a unique opportunity where the defendant immediately realized she had made a terrible mistake in shooting the victim, and both the defendant and victim reached places where they could see a resolution for this incident outside of the criminal justice process,"" said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell. ""In this instance, justice is served by Restorative Justice, and this doesn't happen without Ashley being 100% onboard.""  According to a 2002 United Nations resolution, restorative justice is a ""process in which the victim and the offender, and, where appropriate, any other individuals or community members affected by a crime, participate together actively in the resolution of matters arising from the crime, generally with the help of a facilitator.""   ""Too often, the criminal justice system gets in the way of resolution and healing, even though that is what these two women wanted and needed. Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell made it possible by offering Restorative Justice,"" said Gajwani. ""Ashley and Julia have the biggest hearts of anyone I have ever met. It was an honor to be a part of that conversation.""  ",2
237," (CNN)Three days after a gunshot set off a panic inside the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, police are still looking for the man they say brought the weapon through a security checkpoint and then managed to slip away in the ensuing chaos, firearm in hand. Kenny Wells, 42, is wanted on warrants accusing him of carrying a concealed weapon at a commercial airport, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, discharging a firearm and reckless conduct, Atlanta Police Department Airport Precinct Commander Reginald L. Moorman said Saturday.""We are actively pursuing this individual,"" Moorman added.Here's what we know about the incident that briefly grounded flights at one of the world's busiest airports:Discharged weapon sent holiday travelers scrambling for coverThe incident unfolded around 1:30 p.m., as holiday travelers were winding their way through lines at the airport's main security checkpoint, according to Robert Spinden, the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) federal security director for Georgia. A passenger's property was flagged for a ""secondary search"" after an X-ray screening detected a ""prohibited item,"" Spinden said during a news conference Saturday.""During that secondary search, the passenger lunged into his property, grabbing a firearm that was located inside, which ultimately discharged,"" Spinden said. ""The passenger then fled the security checkpoint through an adjacent exit lane with his firearm.""The incident left three people with non-life-threatening injuries, TSA officials said. A source familiar with the matter told CNN those injured were not shot; they were hurt while the airport was evacuated. The firearm was discharged into the property of the person who brought the weapon, the source said.All the injured were adults, two of whom were taken to the hospital, according to the source.""We're fortunate that when the firearm went off, nobody was seriously injured,"" Spinden said.Witnesses describe panicAirport spokesperson Andrew Gobeil characterized the discharge as accidental, adding the loud noise created a ""sense of chaos."" That chaos was captured in videos recorded by witnesses who describe terrified passengers running for safety, fearing a possible active shooter situation.In one video posted by Stephoń Stafford, line dividers are knocked down as people are lying on the ground in an apparent attempt to seek cover as someone is heard shouting, ""Get down."" Stafford said he was about to go through security with his child.Another video shared on Twitter by Haşmet Asilkan from outside the airport shows many people running in a frenzy as someone is heard urging people to run.Erika Zeidler, who was traveling from Atlanta to Anchorage, Alaska, said she was sitting in a restaurant in Concourse T when people began running down the hallway.""We thought they were late for a flight, and then more and more people started running,"" she told CNN's Jim Acosta. ""There was some screaming and then somebody stopped and said, 'There's a shooter, you need to go.'""Dianne Callahan was traveling with her son and had boarded her flight to New York. She said she heard screams outside of the plane when the crew closed the door. She also heard sirens, Callahan said, and didn't know what was going on.""It was an extremely tense situation,"" she said. ""People were pushing to get on the plane that were not even on our flight. That's how scared they were.""Callahan and her son were then sent to go back through security, she said.Guns pose a 'huge problem' for TSAIt is illegal for people to take firearms through security checkpoints at airports in the US, according to Page Pate, a Georgia criminal defense attorney and constitutional lawyer.According to TSA Administrator David Pekoske, the number of passengers bringing guns to airports has become a ""huge problem.""TSA reports catching 4,650 firearms at checkpoints in the first 10 months of the year -- and the vast majority were loaded. That number surpasses the full-year record of 4,432, set in 2019.At the Atlanta airport, 450 firearms have been detected at checkpoints so far this year, the TSA said Saturday.""We've had many more incidences where there are passenger disturbances both in checkpoints and onboard aircraft. That makes it more important that there are no guns involved,"" Pekoske said in an interview.",2
238," (CNN)New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not happy with her party.She made that abundantly clear in an interview with The New York Times over the weekend, suggesting that the passage of the infrastructure bill and the House approval of President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" measure are simply not enough to deliver on the expectations voters have for her party. And she also aptly diagnosed much of her party's current political problems.""Democrats have a trifecta and have been unable to pass voting-rights protections,"" said Ocasio-Cortez. ""And so people can wring their hands and say 'but Manchin' all they want, or 'but the filibuster' all they want, but at the end of the day, what people see are the results of their actions and the results of investing their time.""I think that's exactly right.The average voter likely knows one thing about our current politics: Democrats are in control of the White House, the Senate and the House. They are far less familiar with the narrowness of the Democratic majorities in those two chambers. Or with the filibuster rules that prevent any legislation from moving forward without 60 votes.That's not for a lack of trying by Biden, of course. He explicitly made the point about the narrowness of Democrats' margin in the Senate during a CNN townhall late last month. ""When you're in the United States Senate and you're President of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, every one is a president,"" Biden said to laughter. ""Every single one.""The reality, however, is closer to AOC's view. In voters' minds, they handed Democrats the keys to the kingdom, and they haven't been terribly happy with the results.Almost 6 in 10 Americans said that Biden wasn't focused enough on the nation's biggest problems, according to a CNN poll released earlier this month. That same poll showed that among those who believe the economy is the most important issue facing the country, almost 3 in 4 are not happy with the amount of attention that Biden has paid to it.While there is some broad agreement on the problem facing Democrats, the party diverges broadly on the solution.The view of most establishment Democrats -- including Biden and his White House -- is that they need to focus more on selling all that they have done to voters. ""I think the White House should do 25 presidential events in the next couple months just on infrastructure,"" said Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of House Democrats' campaign arm, earlier this month. ""And we should do 1,000 congressional events alongside those presidential events.""That is not the view of Ocasio-Cortez, however. Her belief is not that Democrats haven't sold their accomplishments well enough but rather that the party has been too timid to push the envelope legislatively in ways that get the party's base excited and engaged.""I think that if we pass the Build Back Better Act as the House passed it, that we have a shot to go back to our communities and say we delivered,"" said AOC. ""But that's not to say that this process has not been demoralizing for a lot of folks, because there were enormous promises made. Not just at the beginning, and not just during the election, but that continued to be made. And this is where I have sounded the alarm, because what really dampens turnout is when Democrats make promises that they don't keep.""If Ocasio-Cortez is right, the next few weeks/months hold little good for Democrats. The ""Build Back Better"" legislation is certain to be pared down in the Senate by the demands of moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona (among others). And then it will be sent back to the House for, effectively, a rubber stamp of approval -- a move that seems certain to further alienate AOC and her liberal colleagues from the process.Add it up and you get nothing good for Democrats as they try to find their footing ahead of the midterm battle for control of Congress.",2
239,"Washington (CNN)Democrat Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2018 and the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, announced last week that he is running for Texas governor in 2022.Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who announced Tuesday that he had filed to run for reelection, started attacking O'Rourke as radical and out of touch even before O'Rourke made his gubernatorial candidacy official. In a 30-second video ad released online in late October, Abbott's campaign drew attention to comments O'Rourke made on a podcast in June 2020 on the subject of the ""defund the police"" movement. Or, rather, Abbott's campaign drew attention to an altered version of O'Rourke's comments. Facts First: In three important ways, the Abbott ad deceptively edited O'Rourke's words about policing to try to make him sound more extreme. The ad's first deceptive edit deleted key O'Rourke words to make it sound like he had issued a broad, unreserved endorsement of Black Lives Matter activists for bringing attention to the idea of defunding the police. O'Rourke's actual words were narrower: he praised the activists for bringing attention to the idea of defunding ""line items that have overmilitarized our police.""The second deceptive edit deleted key words to make it sound like O'Rourke had called for ""dismantling"" police departments, end of story. He had actually called for dismantling ""and rebuilding"" departments in ""some necessary cases.""The third deceptive edit was especially egregious. This one mashed together phrases from three different O'Rourke sentences. The stitch job made it sound like an O'Rourke comment about the importance of Black Lives Matter activism, and how it is part of a tradition of civil rights activism, was a comment about the importance of defunding the police and dismantling police departments.  For emotional effect, the ad juxtaposed O'Rourke's altered words with a series of video clips of rioting and looting.The Abbott campaign's edits are extra notable because O'Rourke's actual, unedited comments in the June 2020 interview gave Republicans ample attack ammunition. Other O'Rourke opponents have highlighted his words about policing without altering them. Among other comments on policing, O'Rourke praised the city council of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for a decision that month to move toward dismantling the local police department and replacing it with a ""Department of Community Safety."" (Minneapolis voters rejected this idea when it was on the ballot earlier this month.) And because there is no single agreed-upon definition of what counts as ""defunding the police,"" Abbott could have tried to make an argument that O'Rourke's positive words about the notion of defunding certain police ""line items"" is evidence that he had supported the ""defund"" movement.But the Abbott ad did not include O'Rourke's comments about Minneapolis. And on police defunding, the ad sliced and diced O'Rourke's words instead of letting Texans evaluate them for themselves.Abbott campaign spokesman Mark Miner declined on Monday to directly address CNN's questions about the distortions in the ad, which the campaign promoted on Twitter last week. Miner said only: ""Beto O'Rourke clearly supports dismantling and defunding the police and he will need to explain his anti-law enforcement policies to the people of Texas.""O'Rourke campaign spokesman Joe Bowen said on Monday, ""Beto does not support defunding the police."" According to Texas Tribune political correspondent Patrick Svitek, O'Rourke told reporters last Wednesday, ""I don't think I've ever advocated for defunding the police.""We'll look at O'Rourke's position a little later. First let's walk through how the Abbott ad crafted its deception.The ad deleted essential wordsAfter showing clips of masked protesters, smoke on a street and a car on fire, the Abbott ad shows O'Rourke on camera saying: ""I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund..."" Then the screen cuts to a stylized shot of a man's moving mouth as O'Rourke's voice says, ""Completely dismantling those police forces.""But this is not a sentence O'Rourke actually uttered. In fact, the ad deleted two sets of important words, then strung the remaining words together to alter their meaning.Here's what O'Rourke said. The bolded words are the ones that the ad left out.""So I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund, you know, these line items that have overmilitarized our police, and instead invest that money in the human capital of your community, make sure that you have the services, the help, the support, the health care necessary to be well and not require police intervention. And then also in some necessary cases, completely dismantling those police forces and rebuilding them."" The ad moved a key phrase from one sentence to anotherThe end of the ad features O'Rourke's voice -- over video clips of rioting and looting -- saying this: ""Defund, dismantling police forces, it's the only way that things get better.""But that is not a sentence O'Rourke uttered either.So where did the supposed quote come from? The Abbott campaign was unwilling to explain, but it appears that the campaign took three separate O'Rourke remarks from the June 2020 interview and stitched them together as if they were one.O'Rourke made his comment about defunding certain police line items around the 34:46 mark of the podcast. About 30 seconds after that, he made his comment in favor of dismantling certain police forces and rebuilding them. It wasn't until more than a minute after that -- a full minute and a half from the ""defund"" comment -- that he uttered the words ""it's the only way that things get better."" And the context for these words was much different than the ad suggested. Here's the real context.O'Rourke praised the Minneapolis decision to move toward dismantling and replacing the police department, saying the only solution for such a problem-plagued department is ""completely dismantling that system and rebuilding it intentionally with the community members at the table."" He said that this notion might seem dangerous to some people but that ""any major change"" in US history has seemed dangerous to some. He noted that the activism of civil rights movement icon John Lewis and fellow Freedom Riders was dangerous to the status quo. Then O'Rourke said: ""So let's look at Black Lives Matter in that same context and from that same perspective. What they are doing right now is a very proud and necessary tradition of civil rights, and it's the only way that things get better.""The Abbott ad seems to have moved this quote -- ""it's the only way that things get better"" -- to an entirely different sentence with an entirely different meaning.O'Rourke's current positionWhen CNN asked O'Rourke's campaign on Monday for his current position on defunding the police, spokesman Bowen said he does not support it and never has. Again, O'Rourke himself said Wednesday, ""I don't think I've ever advocated for defunding the police.""Because of the haziness of the phrase ""defunding the police,"" O'Rourke's comments in the 2020 interview leave an opening for people to argue either way. Defenders of his position can accurately note that he didn't make a general call for all kinds of police funding to be removed. Opponents can accurately note that he spoke positively of taking away certain police funding and of dismantling (and rebuilding) some police departments.Bowen said that O'Rourke believes that police departments in Texas are now solving a lower percentage of violent crimes than they did when Abbott took office in 2015 because the departments are overburdened ""with responsibilities that may not require a law enforcement response."" ""We should allow other departments and community supports to respond to those challenges in order to allow police forces to focus on their most important job for public safety: addressing violent crime,"" Bowen said. O'Rourke said Wednesday, in the comments reported by Svitek of the Texas Tribune, that he doesn't want law enforcement to have to deal with ""issues where it's more of a mental health care challenge and incident that could be addressed with a social worker or someone who's not in law enforcement.""CNN asked Bowen if O'Rourke believes that some money should be taken away from police budgets and reallocated to these ""other departments"" that would handle the work O'Rourke thinks should be taken away from the police. Bowen said, ""That's a false choice. We cannot guarantee the safety of our communities focusing on one or the other, we must do both. We must invest in these additional services so that police departments can focus their resources on preventing and solving crime.""",2
240," (CNN)The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection issued five new subpoenas on Tuesday targeting right-wing extremist groups that were involved in the attack, including the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.The subpoenas went to the Proud Boys and its leader Enrique Tarrio, as well as the Oath Keepers and its leader Stewart Rhodes. Dozens of members of both groups have been charged in the attack on the US Capitol, and prosecutors have said they conspired ahead of time to disrupt the Electoral College proceedings. (Tarrio and Rhodes have not been charged.)The panel also subpoenaed Robert Patrick Lewis, chairman of 1st Amendment Praetorian, a group that the committee says provided security at ""multiple rallies leading up to January 6.""""We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the committee, said in a statement.Several dozen subpoenas have already been issued as part of the investigation, with mixed success. Investigators say they've spoken to more than 200 witnesses, but some key players from former President Donald Trump's world have stonewalled the probe and refused to testify or produce documents.Right-wing extremists played a major role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Leaders of the Proud Boys were involved in some of the early clashes that overpowered the police lines and breached the building. Members of the Oath Keepers were seen weaving through the crowd in military formation and entering the Rotunda. They're also accused of stashing weapons at a Virginia hotel before the riot.Dozens of members of these right-wing groups are now facing serious criminal charges tied to the January 6 riot, and judges have said many of them are too dangerous to release while they await trial.But so far, Democrats haven't been able to directly connect Trump to the violence that these groups perpetrated at the Capitol. There are plenty of connections between Trump associates and members of these groups, but there is scant evidence that Trump knew of any plan to violently disrupt Congress.The Justice Department has said Rhodes directed members of the Oath Keepers on January 6 while they stormed the Capitol and allegedly destroyed government property. He hasn't been charged with any crimes, even as prosecutors crack down on his followers. CNN reported in July that Rhodes gave a voluntary interview to the FBI and that investigators seized his cell phone. He has denied all wrongdoing.Tarrio is currently in jail after pleading guilty to burning a church's Black Lives Matter banner and bringing high-capacity rifle magazines into DC shortly before the January 6 insurrection. Those charges kept him out of DC on January 6. But he has remained defiant about the role that his organization played in the attack, saying the incident was worth celebrating, while nominally condemning violence.The committee has already issued subpoenas to dozens of people affiliated with the January 6 attack, including Trump White House advisers, Trump campaign officials, several key organizers of the political rally that preceded the riot, and pro-Trump provocateurs who were involved in ""Stop the Steal"" groups.The committee was established in July and has done most of its work in private. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat on the committee, told CNN on Saturday that the panel has already interviewed more than 200 witnesses, including many people who were ""part of the Trump administration."" But other Trump allies have followed Trump's directives to ignore the investigation altogether.Trump ally Steve Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress after defying the panel's subpoena for records and testimony. (He pleaded not guilty.) Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who played a key role in Trump's attempted coup, appeared for a deposition earlier this month but stonewalled the committee by refusing to answer questions, claiming the material was privileged.Proud Boys lawyer respondsA lawyer affiliated with Proud Boys International LLC said on Tuesday he plans to provide some already public documents about the group's formation and bylaws to the House. But he may not have Proud Boys records that speak to some of what the committee wants, such as documents about their activities late last year and around January 6. The lawyer and former Proud Boys chairman, Jason Van Dyke, said some of the documents he has about the group he also will try to protect under attorney-client privileges.Van Dyke received the committee's subpoena, he said, but hasn't had ties to the group since November 2018.""It's been a defunct entity since then. They're wasting their time,"" Van Dyke told CNN. ""They'll have to get it from Tarrio."" The committee acknowledged the Proud Boys International organization dissolved earlier this year.Attorneys for Tarrio and Rhodes have not responded to requests for comment.A spokesperson for the DC Department of Corrections, where Tarrio is still held, hasn't responded to several requests from CNN on whether the jail is allowing detainees to speak to the House select committee. Tarrio is set to be in jail into the new year.This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",2
241," (CNN)Sean Parnell, the Republican endorsed by former President Donald Trump for Pennsylvania's open US Senate seat, announced on Monday he is suspending his campaign. The decision comes after a judge awarded Laurie Snell, Parnell's estranged wife, primary physical custody and sole legal custody of the couple's three children, according to an order that was made public Monday. The judge also determined that Parnell committed some abusive acts toward his wife in the past.""There is nothing more important to me than my children, and while I plan to ask the court to reconsider, I can't continue with a Senate campaign,"" Parnell said in a statement.Parnell spoke with Trump on Monday to inform him of his plans, according to Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich. The former President had backed Parnell, an Army veteran and former congressional candidate, in September in the competitive Republican primary. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection, and Democrats see the seat as one of their top pickup opportunities heading into the 2022 midterms. But allegations against Parnell from his estranged wife had raised concerns among some Republicans about his viability as a candidate. Snell has accused Parnell of being physically abusive toward her and injuring their children on two occasions, claims that Parnell has denied.The judge wrote that he found Snell to be a credible witness when it came to her allegations of abuse -- although those allegations were not the most significant factors in the judge's custody decision.""I strongly disagree with the ruling today and I'm devastated by the decision. I plan on asking the court to reconsider this decision. In the order, two of the leading factors that weighed heavily in the judge's decision revolved around me being a leading U.S. Senate candidate,"" Parnell said in his statement. ""My focus right now is 100% on my children, and I want them to know I do not have any other priorities and will never stop fighting for them.""Parnell will still have partial physical custody of the children various weekends each month.""Ms. Snell is grateful that justice prevailed,"" according to a statement from the Gilliland Vanasdale Sinatra Law Office, which represented Snell. ""She has been awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of their children. She will continue, as always, to focus on their best interests."" 'A tumultuous relationship'   Court proceedings revealed a volatile relationship between Snell and Parnell, which ultimately hobbled Parnell's political aspirations.Snell has accused Parnell of throwing chairs at her; dropping her off on an interstate when she was six months pregnant and telling her to get an abortion; and choking and strangling her, according to court documents.""Upon consideration of the credible evidence, I find that Sean Parnell did commit some acts of abuse in the past,"" Judge James G. Arner wrote about the allegations of abuse regarding Snell. ""However, since the incidents involving Laurie Snell occurred so many years ago and did not involve the children, they are not relevant to this custody determination. I am not making a finding on specifically what did or did not happen.""As to the allegations that Parnell injured their children on two occasions, the judge concluded that the incidents occurred ""as described by Laurie Snell, but I am not placing weight on that evidence because a period of three and one half years has gone by without further incident.""The judge concluded that the incidents involving the children did not amount to child abuse and he noted that the children did not express concerns for their safety.""The fact that Laurie Snell has agreed that Sean Parnell can have substantial periods of unsupervised custody indicates she does not view him as a threat of harm to the children. The children have not expressed any concerns for their safety.""In evaluating the credibility of Snell and Parnell -- who often provided conflicting accounts in their custody trial testimony, particularly surrounding the abuse allegations -- the judge found Snell more credible.""She testified in a convincing manner. Her testimony was not uncertain, confused, self-contradictory, or evasive. Her testimony squares with Sean Parnell's testimony that they had a tumultuous relationship and fought a lot,"" the judge wrote.In contrast, the judge took issue with Parnell's demeanor in court, noting that Parnell dressed casually in jeans and untucked shirts. He also noted that Parnell looked at his attorneys and the news media during his testimony, rather than at the judge.""In evaluating Sean Parnell's testimony, I find it less credible. He simply denied that all of the incidents ever happened,"" the judge wrote. ""He was somewhat evasive. When weighing his position against Laurie Snell's statements of detailed facts about many incidents, Sean Parnell's position is less believable.""Senate campaign worked against Parnell In the judge's opinion, which followed a three-day custody trial, he concluded that both ""parents love their children and provide proper parental care for them,"" but he said the parents' failure to communicate and compromise prevented them from effectively sharing custody.The judge, who is required to consider 16 separate factors when determining custody, assigned the most weight to the children's need for stability and continuity, the parents' availability to care for the children and the level of conflict between the parents and their willingness to cooperate.Parnell's Senate campaign worked against him in the custody fight. The judge noted that Parnell would have been traveling frequently for a campaign and, if he had won, would have spent part of his time in Washington, DC.""These circumstances certainly restrict his ability to have primary physical custody of the children,"" the judge wrote.While Parnell had enjoyed Trump's endorsement in his Senate bid, the allegations from his estranged wife were taking a toll on his campaign, as CNN previously reported.Parnell had canceled fundraising events and ramped down his appearances in conservative media. Multiple Republican operatives in and out of Pennsylvania had told CNN they didn't see how Parnell's campaign -- which has leaned heavily on his children, including a large photo of him with them on his website's homepage -- could continue following the ruling.Earlier this month, Parnell staffers informed Trump's team that Parnell planned to suspend his campaign if he did not receive custody of his children.Budowich, the Trump spokesman, tweeted that the seat ""remains a top priority"" for Trump.This story has been updated with additional information.

242,"New York (CNN Business)The holiday travel season is off to a relatively smooth start, with good weather and few canceled flights. But many in the industry are worried that luck won't hold all the way until the holiday season ends just after New Year's. Major US airlines are operating with fewer pilots and flight attendants than they were before the pandemic. With domestic airline bookings nearly back to normal, airlines are trying to do more with less this holiday season.Service meltdowns in October at Southwest Airlines and American demonstrate what happens when schedules get disrupted without the staffing levels needed to rapidly recover from canceled flights. Problems quickly cascade, resulting in hundreds of additional cancellations.""I do think all of the airlines are stretched thin,"" said Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. ""A major blizzard or event could cause prolonged delays and cancellations.""And anyone who has their flight canceled is going to run into problems finding an alternative way to get where they're going.""If there are issues, reaccommodating people whose flights are canceled will be tough. The planes are very full,"" said Savi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James.Staffing shortagesThe airlines that have experienced recent service disruptions admitted they didn't have enough staff to deal with the problems.Bob Jordan, who is set to become CEO of Southwest early next year, told investors last month that weather and air traffic control issues caused ""a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position and then that took several days to recover.""""We inconvenienced thousands of customers and we further challenged our stellar employees,"" he said. ""And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees.""Jordan said Southwest is making additional trims to its schedule to make sure that doesn't happen again.When air traffic ground to a near halt during the early months of the pandemic, all the airlines used early retirement packages and buyouts to reduce staff voluntarily. All are scrambling to staff up now, but it takes time to hire, train and certify pilots and flight attendants, so much of the current hiring is being done with an eye toward next summer's travel season — not this fall and winter — said Syth.All the airlines say they're prepared to deal with disruptions caused by weather or other issues like air traffic control snafus.""To ensure we're providing certainty for both our customers and team members, we're doubling down on our efforts related to our schedule and staffing,"" said David Seymour, American's chief operating officer, in a note to the airline's staff. ""On the scheduling front, we've ensured that our November and December are built to meet customers demand and that they are fully supportable by our staffing.""But Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union at American and an active pilot himself, said he's concerned that American is stretching its staffing too thin.""We want to fly these flights. But the evidence from earlier this year shows what happens when things don't go as planned,"" he said. ""They're building the schedule right to the maximum number of flights possible and it provides no flexibility for when things go wrong. Airplanes don't fly on hope."" Southwest is trying to operate its current schedule with about 15% fewer pilots than it had before the pandemic, according to Murray, even though the number of flights hasn't been trimmed by nearly that much. That leaves much less ability to recover when issues do crop up.Fewer flightsOverall the number of domestic flights planned from last weekend to just after New Year's Day is down 12% compared to the same period in 2019, according to data from Cirium, an  airline data tracking service. Among the big four US airlines that handle about 80% of air traffic, Southwest and American have the most aggressive schedules compared to their pre-pandemic levels. The number of flights is down just 10% at Southwest and 9% at American, while Delta and United are both down more than 13% compared to 2019.Executives at United and Delta say their more limited schedule should allow them to avoid the service issues experienced at Southwest and American earlier this fall.""If we wanted to be bigger than we are, quite honestly we couldn't be. We could be a little bit, maybe, but not much bigger without risking the operational performance issues like you've seen at some of [the] other carriers,"" Delta president Glen Hauenstein told investors last month. ""So we want to stay where we're confident that we can actually fly the schedules that we put out there.""""Our North Star in this recovery is making sure we do the right thing for customers and if that means sacrificing some possible short-term profits to ensure a reliable operation, then so be it,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby in a letter to customers explaining his airline's reduced schedule.Murray, the head of the Southwest pilots union, says his airline has made changes in its operations since the service meltdown in October that resulted in 2,000 flights being canceled over a weekend, and tens of thousands of stranded passengers. ""I'm not as gravely concerned as I was throughout the summer,"" he said.",2
243,"New York (CNN Business)Expect to pay more for some of your favorite cereals, snacks, soups and cooking brands next year.General Mills (GIS) notified retail customers that it's raising prices in mid-January on hundreds of items across dozens of brands. They include Annie's, Progresso, Yoplait, Fruit Roll-Ups, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Cheerios, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charm's, Wheaties, Reese's Puffs, Trix and more, according to letters General Mills sent to at least one major regional wholesale supplier last week. For some items, prices will go up by around 20% beginning next year.The wholesaler shared General Mills' letters with CNN Business on the condition of anonymity to protect the company's relationship with its suppliers. A leader at the company said it plans to push along all of the increases to its grocery and convenience store customers. He expects they will then pass them down to shoppers.A spokesperson for General Mills did not provide a comment for this story.If more General Mills' customers — including the leading big box stores, supermarkets, drug stores and other chains in the United States — decide to do the same, these familiar brands will get more expensive for shoppers.General Mills' plans are the latest evidence that rising prices won't be going away anytime soon for some of the most recognizable food and household brands. The company is the latest consumer manufacturer to announce price hikes beginning next year, joining Tyson (TSN), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Mondelez (MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Kimberly Clark (KMB) and others.Rising pricesGrocery prices have increased sharply during the pandemic, after stagnating from 2015 through 2019. Prices climbed 1% in October from September and were 5.4% higher than at the same time last year, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Inflation on food, beverages and household basics will climb to 8% during the first half of 2022 before settling at 4% during the latter half of the year, projects IRI, a market research firm. IRI tracks prices, point-of-sale and volume data, promotions and trends at big-box stores, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, pharmacies and other consumer channels. Food manufacturers and grocery chains have faced higher costs for commodities, labor, transportation and other expenses during the pandemic. Those costs have escalated in recent months, prompting them to raise prices to minimize the impact.The producer-price index, which measures the price manufacturers receive for their goods and services, jumped 0.6% last month from September and rose 8.6% annually.General Mills said in the letters that it was responding to higher materials and labor costs. ""The current operating environment is as dynamic as we've experienced in at least a decade, resulting in significant input cost inflation, labor shortages, and challenges servicing the business,"" General Mills said. General Mills said in September that it expects its input cost inflation to be 7% to 8% for its 2022 fiscal year.Uneven impactRising inflation does not impact all shoppers equally. ""Inflation has been more painful for lower-income households,"" Bank of America economists said in a research report last week. That's because they are more exposed to the goods that are seeing prices rise the fastest, such as gas and rent, and they save less than higher-income groups. Some grocery chains are raising prices more quickly than competitors, depending on how much flexibility they have to handle higher costs. Walmart (WMT), the largest grocer in the United States, said its price gaps with competitors are wider than they were before the pandemic because the company is absorbing some costs instead of passing them on. Walmart accounted for 29% of General Mills' sales last year.",2

Its centerpiece is an 80-carat oval, flawless, D-color (highest grade and virtually colorless) ""Empire Diamond,"" named for the iconic jeweler's hometown. The Empire Diamond was ethically sourced in Botswana, cut and polished in Israel and set in Tiffany's workshop in New York City.Tiffany (TIF) said the necklace is its most expensive piece ever created.The good news for jewelry lovers with deep pockets is that this necklace is available for sale — unlike Tiffany's famous 128.54 carat ""Tiffany Diamond,"" which Tiffany said is priceless and not for purchase.The luxury retailer has not yet put a price on The World's Fair Necklace, but industry experts estimate its value to be between $20 million and $30 million.Tiffany's diamond jewelry is famous for adorning celebrities over the decades, from Audrey Hepburn to Beyoncé Knowles. Beyoncé made fashion history as the first Black woman to wear the iconic 128.54 carat Tiffany Diamond for Tiffany's new ""About Love"" campaign.The retailer said the design for The World's Fair Necklace is inspired by a Tiffany necklace made for the 1939 World's Fair held in Queens' Flushing Meadow-Corona Park. That design featured a 200-carat aquamarine stone and more than 400 diamonds. The reimagined World's Fair necklace can be worn in an unexpected way: The wearer can carefully pop out the Empire Diamond and mount it onto a platinum ring, with the aid of a Tiffany jeweler who will be on call whenever that service is required.

245,"New Delhi (CNN)Gulpreet Singh begs for food from a dirty hemp mat spread on the sidewalk outside Delhi's South Campus metro station.Like millions of Indians who survive on handouts or daily wages, the 84-year-old says he has no choice but to be outside, breathing air thick with smog in the Indian capital.""I come here and wait. Sometimes, people give me food,"" said Singh, his voice straining over the noise of auto rickshaws and cars belching fumes just meters away.Delhi is often ranked among the world's most polluted cities, and air pollution there reached ""hazardous"" levels in early November, according to India's National Air Quality Index (AQI), which tracks the presence of harmful particles in the air.But some Delhi residents have become so accustomed to bad air that it's a part of daily life -- they barely notice it, they say.Others say it's making them sick.Choking on smog    A police officer directing traffic at one of Delhi's busy junctions says pollution levels have become ""unbearable"" this winter.""I've taken off my mask because I need to blow the whistle to stop traffic, but it's been horrible,"" said the 48-year-old officer, who didn't reveal his name because he is not authorized to speak to the media.Exhaust fumes flow from the rows of vehicles around him -- he says he finds it hard to catch his breath.""My eyes hurt. It's hard to breathe. It's not easy,"" he said.Social worker Neelam Joshi, 39, says she feels the pollution every time she steps out of her house to catch the train to work.""When you leave the house in the morning, that's the first thing which hits you,"" Joshi said. By the end of the day, she says her body seems to have adjusted, but the next day, it happens all over again.""In the last six years that I have lived in Delhi, there's never been a reduction in pollution,"" she said. ""It only increases every year. Every year we reach a different level, and during festivals it always becomes worse.""Amanpreet Kaur, 28, a flight attendant from Delhi's Rohini area, recently crewed a flight from the United States and was stunned by the difference in air quality.""When I landed back into India, after my flight from USA, it was horrible. I'm continuously coughing,"" she said.Kaur says the smog is so bad that you can see it at night as a dirty haze around street lamps and car headlights.""When the sun sets, all you see is smog, just smog all around,"" Kaur said.""It's very dangerous to live in Delhi.""'My right to breathe'Aditya Dubey, an 18-year-old environmental activist, has spent the past two years lobbying for urgent action against Delhi's pollution.Every year, the city is plagued by a throat-searing cloud of murky smog, but it's worse in winter when lower temperatures and a drop in wind speed trap particles in the air for longer.""Winter has become a torture and every day feels like a punishment,"" Dubey said. ""I have a burning sensation in my eyes and they start watering. I feel breathless.""Last month, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tried to control pollution levels by banning firecrackers for Diwali, the festival of lights, but celebrations mostly proceeded as normal.The smoke from Diwali was exacerbated by a spike in the burning of crop waste in surrounding farmlands.By November 5, most locations in Delhi were recording an AQI above 500 -- the highest level on the scale.At that point, Dubey had had enough.The activist filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking protection for his ""right to breathe.""On November 15, the court ruled in his favor and ordered the central government to do more. Subsequently, schools were shut, non-essential traffic was suspended, construction projects were halted, and six out of 11 coal-fired plants were ordered to close until the end of November.Construction projects resumed Monday as Delhi recorded a marginal improvement in air quality. But for many, the damage had already been done.The 'silent killer'Delhi is not the only Indian city choked by smog.Last year, nine of the world's 10 most polluted cities were in India, according to monitoring network IQAir.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths a year globally, mainly as a result of increased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory infections.Bad air could be reducing the life expectancy of hundreds of millions of Indians by as much as nine years, according to a recent study by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).The study also found that every single one of India's 1.3 billion residents endure annual average pollution levels that exceed guidelines set by WHO.In 2019, the central government announced a national clean air campaign, with an aim to reduce particulate pollution by up to 30% by 2024. Specific plans were created for each city; in Delhi, those plans included measures to reduce road traffic, burn-offs and road dust, and to encourage the use of cleaner fuels.But in the past few years, India's pollution problem has worsened, partly due to the country's dependency on fossil fuels -- and in particular, coal.At the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, India was among a group of countries that pushed for an 11th-hour amendment to the agreement to phase ""down"" coal rather than phase it ""out"".In Delhi, noxious air is claiming tens of thousands of lives each year, according to analysis of IQAir data by Greenpeace.But despite the worsening air quality, some Delhi locals have become so accustomed to it they don't seem to notice.Many roam the streets without a face mask and have developed a general complacency toward pollution levels.Omprakash Mali, a 50-year-old gardener, say the air pollution doesn't affect him or his work.""We work with mud and in dust as a gardener, so I don't feel anything additional,"" he said. ""I think the top priority for the government should still be Covid-19. Pollution happens every year.""Meanwhile, Shesh Babu, 18, a manual laborer, said he ""doesn't really care"" about Delhi's thick smog. His priority is earning money.Dubey, the activist, says air pollution is considered to be an ""elitist"" issue.""Air pollution is a silent killer,"" he said. ""There is a lack of awareness. People don't realize the seriousness of it.""",2
246,"Berdyansk, Ukraine  (CNN)The Ukrainian naval patrol boat ""Kremenchuk"" churns out into the gun-grey waters of the Sea of Azov, one mounted machine gun pointing aft, another pointing fore into the drizzle.Commander Ivan Ovchar explains his ship's mission: ""To defend and maintain the sovereignty of Ukraine.""The threat, the officer and many of Ukraine's allies believe, comes from Russia.For weeks, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been expressing growing concern about Moscow's military activity on the Ukrainian border.""We don't know what President [Vladimir] Putin's intentions are, but we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said Saturday during a trip to Senegal, referring to Russian military incursions, acknowledged or not, into neighboring countries. ""We do know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and then using that as an excuse to do what Russia's planning to do all along.""The Kremlin has responded by accusing western countries of ""hysteria"" about Russia invading Ukraine.Strait jacketWith tensions high in the region, CNN joined the Ukrainian navy vessel departing from Berdyansk on Ukraine's Azov coastline. Usually, Commander Ovchar's crew comes across six or seven Russian coast guard patrol boats, he says, but on this mission, there were none.The sea he's patrolling borders Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow following a controversial referendum in 2014, in violation of international law.Since seizing Crimea, Russia has built a bridge linking it to its own territory. The Kerch Bridge over the Kerch Strait serves as the only direct connection between Russia and Crimea -- and gives Moscow de facto control of the sea's access to the Black Sea and Mediterranean beyond.But Ukraine has a plan to try to keep Moscow from taking complete control of the body of water that links Ukraine's two biggest ports, Berdyansk and Mariupol.Ukraine's new Defense Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced November 13 that the pace of building a new naval port in Berdyansk was to be increased. On Tuesday, CNN gained exclusive access to the ""Sehid"" or ""East"" base under construction.It was immediately clear that a lot of work still needed to be done for this base to be anywhere near completion.The aim was to complete the first phase of construction -- new living quarters, administrative buildings and a small medical facility on the site of a disused tin factory -- by the end of year. However, with less than six weeks to go, there was not even a roof on the main building.A special detachment of military builders toiled with masonry, slapping on cement and laying bricks, a Ukrainian flag billowing as they worked.The scale of the task at hand became even starker as we walked down onto the port, joined to a commercial port.""This will be the position of the docks,"" Capt. 2nd Class Alexander Serdiyk said, pointing to heaps of warped metal and boulders lying haphazardly in the sea. ""We plan to have this section completed in two years.""But Ukraine may not have two years to prepare for conflict.The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, Brigader General Kyrylo Budanov, told the US defense newspaper Military Times that Russia was increasing troop levels and weapons systems in Crimea for an offensive that could come at any time. The Kremlin has repeatedly said it has no plans to invade Ukraine. ""The American and Ukrainian media claim that Russia is preparing for an attack on Ukraine, and we are saying that Ukraine is planning hostilities against Donbas, against the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, said Tuesday. ""We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for an attempt to forcefully resolve the Donbas issue.""  Ukraine's allies have begun responding to what they see as a fresh threat from its neighbor to the east.On Monday, CNN reported that the Biden administration was weighing the possibility of sending military advisers and new equipment, including weaponry, to Ukraine. The package could include Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-armor missiles and mortars.The US is also considering sanctions with European allies if Russia invades Ukraine.Last week, British Defence Minister Ben Wallace visited Ukraine and signed an agreement to ""develop the capabilities of the naval forces of Ukraine."" CNN learned Tuesday that part of the deal will focus on Berdyansk.The same day, the Ukrainian navy announced the arrival of two ""Island-type"" boats named ""Fastiv"" and ""Sumy,"" delivered from Baltimore in the United States to Odessa in Ukraine.""Soon the boats will raise the Ukrainian navy flag and under the command of Ukrainian crews they will begin their combat journey to ensure maritime safety in the Black and Azov seas,"" Admiral Alexey Neizhpapa said.The bigger question is whether new Ukrainian ships and infrastructure, plus warnings from the West, will be enough of a deterrent.

247,"The former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism was sentenced on Tuesday to a total of 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering.Tony Chung, 20, was charged with secession, under a sweeping national security law, and money laundering in October 2020 and was denied bail. Local media reported at the time that he was detained along with two others at a coffee shop close to the United States consulate by unidentified men and was believed to be preparing for an asylum application.Chung had entered a plea bargain, admitting guilt on the charge of secession and one count of money laundering and pleading not guilty to a sedition charge and another money laundering accusation.The plea led to a 25% reduction in his sentence, to 40 months for secession and 18 months for money laundering. Only three months of the latter will be served separately, resulting in a total sentence of 43 months.""He actively organized, planned and implemented activities to separate the country,"" District Court Judge Stanley Chan said.Prosecutor Ivan Cheung has said the defendant acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the US branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party.Pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were also seized from his home, the prosecutor said. The money laundering charge was related to donations he received via PayPal.Like other anti-government organizations, Studentlocalism disbanded before Beijing imposed the security law in June 2020, to punish anything it deems as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The vast majority of Hong Kong people do not support independence, but any mention of the idea is anathema to Beijing.Since the enactment of the security law, Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn, with most democratic politicians now in jail or in self-exile. Dozens of civil society organizations have folded, and some international rights groups have left the city.Chinese and Hong Kong authorities deny the security law tramples individual rights and say the legislation was necessary to restore stability after mass street protests in 2019.The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise -- an allegation that Beijing vehemently denies.",2
248,"London (CNN)People in the United Kingdom think that climate change, pollution and the environment are together the most important issues they face, well ahead of the pandemic, the impacts of Brexit and the country's troubled National Health Service, according to a poll from Ipsos MORI published on Wednesday.The poll showed the highest level of concern about the climate crisis since the agency began polling in 1988. Ipsos MORI publishes its poll monthly, and November's was carried out over a week during the COP26 climate conference. The event was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and received extensive national media coverage. Around 40% of people surveyed said climate change, pollution and the environment were among their top three concerns. The pandemic came second at 27% and Brexit was third, with 22%. Ipsos MORI interviewed more than 1,000 adults, who answered spontaneously and were not prompted with options as answers. Climate concern was 16 percentage points higher in November than October, when people expressed greater concern about Brexit, the pandemic and the economy. While there was a clear bump in interest during the COP26 conference, there has been longterm growth in concern about climate over the past decade, which has been confirmed by other polls, including from YouGov. The Ipsos MORI poll showed was a fairly even distribution of climate concern across age groups, genders and political affiliation.""[It's] very encouraging that climate change is no longer a preoccupation reserved to the young and the liberal,"" Gabriela Jiga-Boy, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Swansea, told CNN. ""It means that British society may not be very divided regarding climate change. This is very important in these times, when we discuss a lot about real or false polarization on issues, and we often exaggerate how polarized people actually are.""Climate a top concern for older people, tooMen and women considered the climate crisis a top issue almost equally, at 40% and 41%, respectively, the poll showed. And supporters of the center-right Conservative Party and center-left Labour Party were equal in their concern for climate issues.In the age group of 55 and over, 47% of people said it was a top issue. For the 35 to 54 age group, it was 43%. Among those 18 to 34 years old, just 27% said the same, though that age group was less likely to say they were worried about any particular issue.Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said that climate change is now a top priority among a majority of groups because the topic is ""becoming personal."" That's also true for how policies like net-zero emissions targets may affect them.Dozens of countries have set a net-zero emissions goal for mid-century, for which they plan to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions and ""capture"" excess, through actions like planing trees or using technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels. Such technology isn't fully developed and remains controversial.  ""We are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change -- from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy,"" Hiteva told CNN in an email.While concern about the climate crisis is fairly even among age groups, support for different types of climate action is more divisive.""Older people are more inclined to pay for investment in infrastructure to improve the experience of future generations, while people between the age of 18-25 are significantly less inclined to pay more for improvements that they will not experience in their lifetime,"" she said, citing her own research on climate action.""The only way for this to translate into action is to use the momentum of the moment and engage people with re-imagining how infrastructure investment can be designed and used in an innovative way which is not only kinder to the environment but is also more inclusive and fairer.""",2
249,"A US warship again sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, part of what the US military calls routine activity but which always riles China whose government believes Washington is trying to stir regional tensions.The US Navy said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Milius conducted a ""routine Taiwan Strait transit"" through international waters in accordance with international law.""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows,"" it added.There was no immediate response from China.Last month, the Chinese military condemned the United States and Canada for each sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait, saying they were threatening peace and stability in the region.China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the past year or so, provoking anger in Taipei.The United States like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.Beijing calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with Washington.US Navy ships have been transiting the strait roughly monthly, to the anger of Beijing. US allies occasionally also send ships through the strait, including Britain in September.",2
250,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Paytm is starting to stage a recovery from its disastrous stock market debut last week, but the digital payments firm faces an uphill battle winning over investors worried about its ability to turn a profit in the face of growing competition. Shares of the Indian company — trading under the name of its parent, One97 Communications — plunged in the days since they began trading in Mumbai in the country's biggest IPO when measured in local currency.The stock edged higher on Tuesday, but it's still down more than 30% from its issue price, a loss of $5.7 billion in market value.Analysts expressed several concerns about Paytm in the run-up to its offering. The company lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year and seems far from ready to turn a profit. It's also up against growing competition from some of the biggest tech firms in the world. Companies such as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) are using an Indian government-backed technology called the Unified Payments Interface. ""Dabbling in multiple business lines inhibits Paytm from being a category leader in any business except wallets, which are becoming inconsequential with the meteoric rise in UPI payments,"" analysts at Macquarie wrote in a research note last week.""Most things that Paytm does, every other large ecosystem player like Amazon, Flipkart, Google, etc, are doing,"" the analysts added.Big questions remain about how Paytm can effectively profit off its massive customer base, according to Prashant Gokhale, chief operating officer at Aletheia Capital. Paytm said in its IPO filing that it had 337 million registered consumers and 22 million merchants. But Gokhale told CNN Business the problem is how the company can turn those consumers into revenue. ""They have a lot of subsidiaries. They have insurance, they have stock broking, they have financial services,"" Gokhale said, adding that the company wants to make money by selling those additional services to existing users of its payments app.But he said those businesses are all rife with competition, making it difficult to see how there's a pathway to profitability for Paytm.These kinds of IPOs ""remind a new generation of investors that there are risks,"" Gokhale added.Talking to CNN last week, Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma acknowledged his company's poor IPO performance, and said that if it had waited to announce a few more quarterly results, ""our execution plan would bring comfort to a lot more people.""Paytm ""is a new business model for many public market investors,"" he told CNN's Julia Chatterley, adding that numbers in subsequent quarters ""will explain this much better.""""I would say that it is very early days to say that we would not be profitable,"" Sharma added. ""Our numbers and revenues will do the job of talking.""— Diksha Madhok contributed to this report.",2
251,"New York (CNN Business)The Chinese economy presents some unique challenges for investors. On one hand, China is home to several of the most dynamic and rapidly growing companies on the planet, such as electric car makers Xpeng and Nio (NIO) as well as privately held TikTok owner ByteDance.But China's recent crackdown on the tech sector has slowed earnings momentum at big brand name firms including Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA) and WeChat owner Tencent (TCEHY). Continued human rights concerns, brought to the forefront once more following questions about the safety of tennis star Peng Shuai, are also a problem for some investors. So can (and should) you avoid the world's second largest economy? Some experts think that's exactly what investors should be doing.""Investors have underestimated autocracy risk,"" said Perth Tolle, sponsor of the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets (FRDM) ETF, a fund that has no exposure to Chinese stocks. ""You can't always factor in the risk of a government coming in overnight and saying to a company 'you can't really make a profit,'"" she said. Tolle told CNN Business that investors should be more concerned about capital flowing out of the country due to worries about Beijing exerting more control over companies in mainland China.That's why her fund has more exposure to other markets such as Taiwan and South Korea instead of China. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) are two top holdings in the FRDM ETF.Emerging markets funds doing better without China exposureTolle isn't the only one screening out China from emerging markets funds. Big fund companies such as iShares and Columbia Threadneedle also have emerging market ETFs that leave Chinese companies out of their holdings. The funds have outperformed broader emerging markets funds this year, too, showing that investing for social good can be profitable. The FRDM ETF, as well as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (EMXC) and Columbia EM Core ex-China ETF (XCEM), are each up between 6% and 8% in 2021. That's compared to a 2% drop for the broader iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which owns Tencent, Alibaba and Chinese food delivery service Meituan as top holdings. Other investing experts argue that Chinese president Xi Jinping's recent push to crack down on big tech firms is not a good sign for earnings in the short-term.""We like the longer-term view, but in the near- term, we're more cautious,"" said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. ""Some other emerging markets have better growth potential.""""The move from promoting more entrepreneurship to an equal growth sharing of the pie changes the equation,"" he added. ""We took some money off the table and reduced our exposure to China.""Another portfolio manager argued that trying to predict which companies or sectors will come under the ""Xi Jinping thought sphere of influence"" makes investing there a challenge. Major Chinese education stocks have taken a hit this year as well due to regulatory concerns. ""The investor perception of risk has risen in China, and it has risen with cause,"" said Paul Espinosa, portfolio manager with Seafarer Capital Partners.   Espinosa also said China isn't as attractive as other emerging markets simply because stocks outside of the country are better bargains. Companies in Brazil and others parts of Latin America are more compelling values than Chinese-based firms, Espinosa said. He's also looking at investment opportunities in the Middle East.""Everyone is so focused on China, and it is dominated by growth investors,"" he said. ""But there are more opportunities outside of China."" ",2
252,"The United Nations on Monday pushed for urgent action to prop up Afghanistan's banks, warning that a spike in people who are unable to repay loans as well as lower deposits and a cash liquidity crunch could cause the financial system to collapse within months.In a three-page report on Afghanistan's banking and financial system seen by Reuters, the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said the economic cost of a banking system collapse - and consequent negative social impact - ""would be colossal.""An abrupt withdrawal of most foreign development support after the Taliban seized power on Aug. 15 from Afghanistan's Western-backed government has sent the economy into freefall, putting a severe strain on the banking system which set weekly withdrawal limits to stop a run on deposits.""Afghanistan's financial and bank payment systems are in disarray. The bank-run problem must be resolved quickly to improve Afghanistan's limited production capacity and prevent the banking system from collapsing,"" the UNDP report said.Finding a way to avert a collapse is complicated by international and unilateral sanctions on Taliban leaders.""We need to find a way to make sure that if we support the banking sector, we are not supporting Taliban,"" Abdallah al Dardari, head of UNDP in Afghanistan, told Reuters.""We are in such a dire situation that we need to think of all possible options and we have to think outside the box,"" he said. ""What used to be three months ago unthinkable has to become thinkable now.""Afghanistan's banking system was already vulnerable before the Taliban came to power. But since then development aid has dried up, billions of dollars in Afghan assets have been frozen abroad, and the United Nations and aid groups are now struggling to get enough cash into the country.'Under the mattress'The UNDP's proposals to save the banking system include a deposit insurance scheme, measures to ensure adequate liquidity for short- and medium-term needs, as well as credit guarantees and loan repayment delay options.""Coordination with the International Financial Institutions, with their extensive experience of the Afghan financial system, would be critical to this process,"" UNDP said in its report, referring to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.The United Nations has repeatedly warned since the Taliban took over that Afghanistan's economy is on the brink of a collapse that would likely further fuel a refugee crisis. UNDP said that if the banking system fails, it could take decades to rebuild.The UNDP report said that with current trends and withdrawal restrictions, about 40% of Afghanistan's deposit base will be lost by the end of the year. It said banks have stopped extending new credit, and that non-performing loans had almost doubled to 57% in September from the end of 2020.""If this rate continues of non-performing loans, the banks may not have a chance to survive in the next six months. And I am being optimistic,"" al Dardari said.Liquidity has also been a problem. Afghan banks heavily relied on physical shipments of U.S. dollars, which have stopped. When it comes to the local afghani currency, al Dardari said that while there is about $4 billion worth of afghanis in the economy, only about $500 million worth is in circulation.""The rest is sitting under the mattress or under the pillow because people are afraid,"" he said.As the United Nations seeks to avert famine in Afghanistan, al Dardari also warned about the consequences of a banking collapse for trade finance.""Afghanistan last year imported about $7 billion worth of goods and products and services, mostly foodstuff ... If there is no trade finance the interruption is huge,"" he said. ""Without the banking system, none of this can happen."" ",2

""People don't have clean drinking water, indoor plumbing, electricity.""She wanted to do more to help bring these essentials to communities most in need. In 2015, with the help of friends, Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata. Today, the non-profit provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. ""We didn't know anything at first, but we had all the determination,"" Colpas said.Colpas, now 31, and her team of other young like-minded counterparts currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people. CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Colpas about her efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversationCNN: Who does your organization help?Jenifer Colpas: The communities where we are working, they are very diverse. You can find indigenous people, farmers, and most of the places where we are working now, they are a displaced population.Over 50 years of war have made Colombia the country with the highest internal-displaced population in the world.  These rural communities were taken over by the FARC and other paramilitary groups. Because of all the years that those communities were in a conflict zone, they were totally forgotten. They have been invisible to the government and for a lot of Colombians. They are the hardest to reach and less likely to have access to any basic service. These areas are so remote that there are no roads to get there. Nobody goes there. But we are going there to provide access to basic services. CNN: Why was it especially important for you and your team to put local women in leadership positions to assist with the projects? Colpas: We are working with women because, for us, it's very important to empower them and to re-signify their role inside the community. So they will be not just social leaders, but also problem-solvers.The leaders have different roles. One is that they are our main partners within the community. They are the first contact in case there is something we need to fix. If something happens with any of the families, they are our main contact. They are the ones that are working on the solutions in the long term. They help us to organize logistics before any installation. They help us understand how to reach the community, which is the best way we can organize the team to go there and to do the installation process. So, we train them and share our knowledge.CNN: What are you providing these communities on a deeper level?Colpas: We're covering their basic needs so they can start dreaming. My biggest dream for them is that they can wake up not just to survive, but they can make a step further and start fulfilling their dreams. Their stories, their inner power to go ahead even in a really bad situation, through all they are suffering, is what inspires me. They are very resilient. Every time I talk with them, they really motivate me, inspire me to go further. Because despite all the problems they face, they never give up. Want to get involved?

And now you can vote on who you think should be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause.To find out who is named Hero of the Year, you'll have to watch ""The 15th Annual CNN Heroes All-Star Tribute,"" hosted by Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa on Sunday, December 12, starting at 8 p.m. ET. CNN Heroes has been spotlighting the impactful work of people across the world since 2007. Here's a look at this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes:Jenifer Colpas: Bringing clean water and power to rural villages in her countryHer cause: Jenifer Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata in 2015, a non-profit that provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. Colpas and her team currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people.What inspired her: Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door. After college, she moved to India for a job in information technology. There, she became aware of vast social inequalities.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said. She decided to change her career path and return home, where she co-founded Tierra Grata, which means ""gratitude to the earth"" in Spanish.Read more about Jenifer Colpas and her workLynda Doughty: The seal rescuerHer cause:  For the past decade, Lynda Doughty's nonprofit, Marine Mammals of Maine, has provided response efforts, assistance and medical care for more than 3,000 marine animals.The group monitors 2,500 miles of coastline and operates a 24-hour hotline, responding to calls about distressed or deceased marine mammals, and it has federal authorization to provide temporary care for critically ill and injured seals. Data gathered on these animals allows Doughty and her team to monitor trends in diseases and human impact on marine mammal health.What inspired her:  Growing up in coastal Maine, Doughty developed a passion for the marine wildlife living along the coast and knew from an early age that she wanted to dedicate her life to protecting them.""I just remember being so amazed (by them) and wondering what's happening in their life,"" Doughty said.She also became aware that their livelihood was jeopardized by pollution, habitat destruction and other human-related activity.""I knew that I wanted to do something to help these animals,"" Doughty said.She became a marine biologist and worked for several years with organizations that provided emergency response and rehabilitation for sick and injured marine mammals. But as nonprofits and state agencies lost funding or closed their doors, Doughty decided to step in and fill the gap.Read more about Lynda Doughty and her workDavid Flink: Creating a new way to learnHis cause:  David Flink's Eye to Eye program pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference. Eye to Eye's 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school.What inspired him: Growing up, Flink had a hard time focusing in school, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. With the support of his parents and the right school, Flink graduated high school and went to Brown University.When he got to college, he found a community of students who also had learning differences. Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability.Read more about David Flink and his workDr. Patricia Gordon: Saving women from a preventable diseaseHer cause: Dr. Patricia Gordon operates CureCervicalCancer, which delivers screening, training and supplies to clinics around the world. The organization has since worked in 10 countries, including China, Haiti, Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Vietnam.The non-profit has screened more than 150,000 women and treated more than 8,600 to date. It has also established 106 sustainable clinics to screen and treat women in remote and underserved areas.""That there are 8,000 women who are alive and well and able to provide for their families is honestly the most rewarding thing that I could have ever imagined in my life,"" Gordon said. ""I think I'm the luckiest doctor that ever lived.""What inspired her: Gordon, a radiation oncologist, traveled with a group of doctors in 2012 to bring a new radiation device to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. While there, she saw how many women were needlessly being killed by a preventable, treatable disease: cervical cancer.""There are 350,000 women dying a painful, undignified death globally. And it's almost 100% preventable,"" she said.The team arranged to provide cervical cancer screenings for women in a remote and hard-hit area of Senegal. Using a method Gordon and others call ""See & Treat,"" screening can be done without needing electricity and with a few transportable supplies.It was a far cry from the way things operated in her Beverly Hills office, but the experience stayed with Gordon, whose own family history of breast cancer is a driving force in her work.After 27 years, Gordon left her private practice in 2014 to devote all her time to CureCervicalCancer. She takes no salary.Read more about Dr. Patricia Gordon and her workHector Guadalupe: Giving former prisoners a second chanceHis cause: Hector Guadalupe's non-profit, A Second U Foundation, helps formerly incarcerated men and women get certified as personal trainers and build careers in the fitness industry so they can support their families. Guadalupe and his team of volunteers offer a free eight-week program for 10-15 students every quarter to prepare for the national certification exam.In addition to study materials and exam fees, the program now also provides each student a free tablet with keyboard, transportation, new clothing, software classes and a $1,300 stipend. Coaches also mentor students, helping with far more than classwork.Once students have passed the exam, Guadalupe helps them get jobs. More than 200 people have graduated from the program since 2016 and only two have reoffended -- a recidivism rate of less than 1%.  What inspired him: By the time he was a teenager, Guadalupe had lost both parents and ended up spending 10 years in prison for drug trafficking. There he became obsessed with fitness and got certified as a personal trainer. When he came home, he was determined to work at one of Manhattan's elite gyms.""Six days out of the week, I'm literally at every corporate health club ... filling out applications,"" Guadalupe said. ""Nobody was calling me back ... and I knew why: because of my past ... But I didn't give up.""After nine months, he landed an opportunity and worked without a day off for four years to establish himself in New York's fitness scene. Now, he devotes much of his week to helping others do the same.Read more about Hector Guadalupe and his workMichele Neff Hernandez: Finding a way through grief togetherHer cause: Michele Neff Hernandez created Soaring Spirits in 2008, three years after her husband's death. Her nonprofit connects widows and widowers, allowing them to heal in a community that understands the pain of losing a partner. It has grown to include 70 regional chapters all over the US, as well as pen pals and programs specifically for the LGBTQ community.To date, the organization has reached more than 4 million people worldwide.""It's about helping widowed people live life in community with each other, so that someone who has borne witness to their pain also bears witness to their life as they continue making their way forward,"" Neff Hernandez said.What inspired her: Hernandez and her husband, Phillip, were enjoying the active life they built as a couple. But everything changed in August 2005 when Phillip went for a bike ride and was hit by a car and killed.""I didn't even know what to do with myself,"" Neff Hernandez said. ""Every single thing about my life changed.""While she had a great support system, none of their friends and family knew how to handle her grief.Hernandez realized she wanted to connect with other widows to learn how they dealt with their new reality.""I thought if I could bring these widows together, what a difference that would make,"" she said.Read more about Michelle Neff Hernandez and her workZannah Mustapha: Building a strong and peaceful future generation His cause: For more than a decade, Zannah Mustapha has devoted his life to providing hope and peace for children in northern Nigeria caught in the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. He and his staff educate more than 2,000 students from both sides of the conflict at the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School.The school offers psychological and social support to help children with trauma. Students, who all live nearby with relatives or family members, are also provided uniforms, books, meals and health services.Mustapha said 1,023 students have graduated, and many have gone on to college or careers.""These are children (who are) ravaged by the disturbances that Boko Haram has brought in,"" he said. ""Children ... are not even having this war.""What inspired him: Mustapha said he believes the way to achieve true and lasting peace in the devastated region is through education, and he has defied all odds to keep the doors to his three schools open.He started the program in 2007 with 36 orphans and expanded, even as others fled the region. As Mustapha continued to expand to meet the needs of children, he saw more and more women struggling when their husbands were killed in the conflict. So, he developed a program in which women could learn a trade to help support their families.A peace leader, Mustapha envisions a Nigeria where there is no more violence, where education and acceptance are encouraged for all.""(When I) see the faces of these children and how these children are dreaming, it gives me the hope that still there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""Read more about Zannah Mustapha and his workShirley Raines: Beauty 2 the StreetzHer cause:  For the past six years, Raines and her organization, Beauty 2 the Streetz, have been a mainstay on Los Angeles' Skid Row, providing food, clothing, hair and makeup services -- and most recently health and hygiene items -- to thousands of people.Rain or shine, she sets up ""shop"" weekly at the corner of 5th and Townes to serve those she calls ""Kings"" and ""Queens."" Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to downtown LA to feed and bring supplies to people.What inspired her: Raines' 2-year-old son Demetrius was staying with her grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized.He died on Sept. 6, 1990, just shy of his third birthday.""I blamed myself for not having stability. If only I'd had my own backyard. If only I'd had my stuff together,"" Raines said.  Soon after, Raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son's biological father to cancer.""I just fell apart. I lived a very unhappy life. I couldn't keep anything together,"" she said.After struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades, Raines' twin sister stepped in, urging her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,'"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Read more about Shirley Raines and her workDr. Ala Stanford: Bringing Covid-19 testing and vaccines to Philly's minority neighborhoodsHer cause: Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods.Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing.In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour ""Vax-A-Thon"" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people.The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers.What inspired her:  Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, Stanford's family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep her from dreaming big.""I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it,"" she said. ""That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what.""She became a pediatric surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.She was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia as a result of Covid-19. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent White areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.So, she gathered up protective supplies from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.""The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started,"" she said.Read more about Dr. Ala Stanford and her workMade Janur Yasa: A plastic clean-up program that's feeding familiesHis cause: Made Janur Yasa's non-profit, Plastic Exchange, allows local villagers in Bali, Indonesia, to exchange plastic trash for rice, a main food staple. This barter system benefits the environment and empowers the local people.  In May 2020, he hosted the first exchange in the village where he was born and raised. It was a success, and the concept quickly spread to other villages across Bali.Villages hold community exchange events once a month in which residents can bring in plastic to trade in for rice. Yasa says the organization has so far helped feed thousands of families and collected nearly 300 tons of plastic for recycling.What inspired him: Yasa owns a vegan restaurant on Indonesia's island of Bali, where tourism is the driving economic force. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many residents lost their jobs.""I saw people in my village start worrying about how they were going to put food on the table,"" he said. ""This concerned me.""Yasa said he wanted to find a way to help people in his community during the pandemic while also addressing the ongoing problem of plastic pollution on Bali's beaches.""I got to thinking, inside the challenge there is an opportunity,"" he said.Read more about Made Janur Yasa and his work",2
255," (CNN)Sudan's newly reinstated prime minister told CNN on Tuesday that he compromised in a deal with the country's military in order to ""avoid bloodshed"" and a civil war. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and other ministers were detained during a military coup last month that saw the country's power-sharing government dissolved; more than 40 people have since been killed in protests. But the country's military chief, General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, reinstated Hamdok on Sunday as part of a deal between the military and civilian leadership in the country, In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Hamdok said he ""regretted the bloodshed"" that had followed the October 25 coup; he said the agreement had been signed in order to ""avoid further killing.""""This a not a personal interest for me,"" he said. ""There is a motto that says you will die for country. I took the right decision.""Under the deal agreed by Hamdok and Al-Burhan, Hamdok again becomes leader of the transitional government, which was first established after strongman President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in 2019. The Council of Ministers, which was dissolved on October 25, will be restored and the civilian and military leadership will share power. The constitution will be amended to outline the partnership between civilians and the military in the transitional government.But the agreement also includes as yet unspecified restructuring, according to Mudawi Ibrahim, a prominent official in the National Forces Initiative (NFI) which helped mediate the talks, and it has been met with resistance in Sudan. Police fired tear gas at a large group of protesters near the presidential palace in Khartoum on Sunday, according to eyewitnesses on the ground.The deal was rejected by Sudan's Forces of Freedom and Change coalition (FCC), which insisted there was ""no negotiation, no partnership, nor legitimacy for the coup plotters.""On Monday, Ibrahim told CNN that the agreement was ""very humiliating for the Prime Minister,"" adding that it had been accepted ""for the sake of the country.""""There are so many people dying on the streets ... so the Prime Minister had to take this step and accept the humiliation,"" he said.But Hamdok, who had been held under house arrest until Sunday, refuted the idea he had been humiliated and insisted he had made the right choice.He called the agreement with the military imperfect and deficient, but said the decision to sign it was taken in order to avoid a catastrophe. ""There is a perfect agreement and there is a workable agreement. If you wait for a perfect agreement, you will be waiting too long and it will be too late,"" he said.He said he was confident in the military and pledged to work with them to ""establish a fair roadmap"" for the future of Sudan.The deal, signed on live television, calls for the release of all political prisoners arrested by security forces following the coup.Only nine prisoners out of 31 have been released so far, Hamdok said; he called for the immediate release of those still in detention.""This is the number one agenda item,"" he added. ""I will not rest until all of them are released.""",2
256,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Ethiopian Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed has announced he will lead his country's soldiers on the front lines of the war against advancing rebel fighters, in the latest escalation of the year-long conflict between his government and rebel groups from the northern Tigray region. ""Starting tomorrow, I will head to the war front to lead the defense forces in person,"" he wrote in a statement on Twitter late Monday, urging citizens to ""lead the country with a sacrifice"" and join him. ""Those of you who aim to be one of Ethiopia's children who will be celebrated in history, rise up today for your country, let's meet at the war front.""""In the past and in the present, the needs and lives of each and every one of us is below [the needs of] Ethiopia,"" Abiy added. ""We would rather die to save Ethiopia than outlive Ethiopia.""Abiy referred to the push as the ""final fight to save Ethiopia"" from ""internal and external enemies"" who he claims are ""ready to build their strength on the weakness of Ethiopia.""   The statement comes after the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) -- the former ruling party of Tigray -- claimed its fighters had captured two towns as they advance towards the capital Addis Ababa, more than one year after the conflict erupted in the north of the country. The TPLF, which ruled the country for more than three decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, has been designated a terrorist group by the current government.One of the towns TPLF claims was captured on Saturday includes Shewa Robit, which is about 220 km (136 miles) northeast of Addis Ababa. CNN has not been able to reach the federal government for comment on the claim. TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda responded to Abiy's statement in a tweet, warning that ""our forces won't relent on their inexorable advance towards bringing his chokehold on our people to an end."" While the Prime Minister is on the battlefield, his duties and the duties of other administrators who have joined the fight will be done by federal and regional officials who will ""work to their fullest capacity"" to oversee the development and administration of the country. ""Ethiopia is the name of winners,"" Abiy concluded his statement, "" I never doubt that my generation shall pay the price in its name as an icon of freedom."" When Abiy received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for ending a 20-year war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, he was lauded as a regional peacemaker. Now, he is presiding over a protracted civil war with rebels in Tigray that by many accounts bears the hallmarks of genocide.In November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in the northern Tigray region and promised that the conflict would be resolved quickly. One year on, the fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people from their homes, fueled famine and given rise to a wave of atrocities.Awol Allo, an associate professor of law at Keele University in the UK who was among those nominated Abiy for the Peace Prize, wrote of his shock over the Prime Minister's statement on joining the front lines. ""The announcement is replete with languages of martyrdom and sacrifice. This is so extraordinary and unprecedented, it shows how desperate the situation is,"" he tweeted on Monday. Abiy has repeatedly used inflammatory language while urging supporters to rise up against Tigrayan forces. In late October, Facebook removed a post by Abiy that violated the company's policies on inciting violence.  ",2
257,"Nairobi, KenyaA Kenyan government directive that residents must show proof of Covid-19 vaccination by December 21 to access services was welcomed by some businesses on Monday but criticized by others, who said low vaccination rates made it unrealistic.Only 8.8% of people are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 in Kenya so far.Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe made the announcement on Sunday. Public services affected include schools, transport services, immigration and other state offices, and hotels, bars, restaurants, national parks and wildlife reserves.The government will start a 10-day mass vaccination campaign on Friday, Kagwe said.Directives about vaccines have split public opinion globally. Some politicians and citizens say measures infringe on personal choice and others say they protect the public.Carol Kariuki, chief executive of the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), which claims more than half a million members, told Reuters the group encouraged all Kenyans to get inoculated.""This is not only good for business continuity and the economy but also to protect others,"" she said.But some local business owners said the directive were not practical.""Who is going to implement it?"" said Franklin Odhiambo, a restaurant owner in Nairobi. ""Some of us may want to be compliant, others may not. So, it will create some unfair competition.""The edict comes just a month after the government lifted a curfew in place since March 2020.Rights group Amnesty International said Kenya would not be able to vaccinate the majority of its population by the deadline, so many people might be unable to earn a living, access transport or go to school.Irungu Houghton, executive director of Amnesty International's Kenya office, said the government directive was unrealistic and flawed.""These regulations will deprive millions of people of their ability to earn a livelihood, to have access to security, health and transportation services back and forth from home to work or school,"" he told Reuters.""That's not how we will win the war against Covid-19,"" he said, calling on the government to work harder to address vaccine hesitancy. ""It turns what the World Health Organization (WHO) would argue is an important voluntary exercise into a coercive exercise.""Shoe-shiner Winnie Buong agreed.""They ought to have done a more aggressive vaccination campaign before lifting the lockdown,"" Buong said. ""I don't understand why they want to make our lives more difficult.""Though low compared to Western nations, Kenya's rate of fully vaccinated citizens is higher than the African average of under 5%. The WHO says Africa lags in Covid-19 vaccination rates due to global inequities in vaccine supplies, not because Africans do not want to be vaccinated.Kenya has reported about 255,000 coronavirus infections and 5,300 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a Reuters tracker.",2
258,"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN)Sudan's military chief on Sunday reinstated Abdalla Hamdok as prime minister, almost a month after he was ousted in a military takeover.Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan appeared with Hamdok at a signing ceremony in the Presidential Palace, according to a live video broadcast on state television.The deal agreed upon by Hamdok and Al-Burhan also includes the release of political detainees who were jailed following the October 25 coup, according to Mudawi Ibrahim, a prominent official in the National Forces Initiative, which helped mediate the talks.Hamdok becomes leader again of the transitional government, which was first established following the ousting of former strongman and President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Hamdok and Al-Burhan also agreed on a power-sharing deal between civilian and military leadership, but it will include as-of-yet unspecified restructuring, according to Ibrahim.Ibrahim said Hamdok's agreement with Al-Burhan includes the following measures:Gen. Burhan would restore the Council of Ministers which was dissolved following the October 25 coup.Political detainees jailed after the takeover (including government, politicians and protesters) would be released.A unified army would be created.A committee is to be formed to investigate protests following the October 25 coup.Sudan's constitution would be amended to include new articles to specifically outline the partnership between civilians and the military in the transitional government.It was a humiliating deal accepted ""for the sake of the country,"" Ibrahim told CNN's Becky Anderson on Monday.""We did not broker a good agreement, this is very humiliating for the Prime Minister,"" Ibrahim said. ""There are so many people dying on the streets...so the Prime Minister had to take this step and accept the humiliation."" ""But how can we remove the military? If there is a way to remove the military we could have done this, we don't have the power to remove the military, we don't have arms, we don't have tanks,"" he added.Hamdok was released on Sunday from house arrest, under which he had been placed following the coup, according to a source within the National Forces Initiative. An eyewitness said security forces surrounding Hamdok's residence since last month were withdrawn, but his personal guard remains in place.    The deal has met with resistance in Sudan. Police fired tear gas at a large group of protesters near the Presidential Palace in Khartoum on Sunday, according to eyewitnesses on the ground. The protests began in downtown Khartoum then moved on to the Presidential Palace in the city center.Reacting to reports on the deal, the Darfur Lawyer's Association said in a statement: ""There is no bargaining again"" and ""the solution starts with holding Al-Burhan accountable for the crimes committed since October 25, 2021."" ""The Association assures that any initiative or bargaining for a settlement between yesterday's parties to bring Hamdok or others (like him) back in to power will 'not bring any result' when the demands and rights of the people of Sudan are not met,"" the statement added.  The deal was rejected by Sudan's Forces of Freedom and Change coalition (FCC), which said Sunday there is ""no negotiation, no partnership, nor legitimacy for the coup plotters.""They also said the crimes of the regime -- from dissolving the constitution to causing repression of and violence against the people -- must be brought to trial in order that justice be met. The FCC outlined further allegations against the military in its statements, to which the military has not directly responded.""We have nothing to do in any agreement with this brutal gang, and we are working with all peaceful means to bring this (gang) down, working with all the forces of the revolution, professional groups, resistance committees, and all the honorable people,"" the FCC statement said.The statement closed by calling for a ""new and glorious revolution,"" that will ""tighten the noose on those behind the coup, and lead to their downfall.""The Sudan Doctors Syndicate (SDS) also rebuffed news of the political agreement reached by Sudan's military and Hamdok. ""News is circulating about an initiative that is being announced in which a political settlement is being announced,"" the SDS said in a statement.The SDS added: ""Whether it is true or not, we, the Sudan Doctors Legitimate Syndicate declare:#no_reconciliation#no_settlement#no_partnershipThe blood of the martyrs still irrigates the streets and has not dried up#Revolution is a people's revolution.""Sudan descended into a crisis last month, after the military dissolved the country's power-sharing government and declared a state of emergency.The move sparked protests and condemnation of the military.",2
259," (CNN)Gunmen killed a policeman and kidnapped five Chinese nationals near a mine in southeast Democratic Republic of Congo overnight, a local official and an army spokesman said on Sunday.It was not clear who carried out the attack near the village of Mukera in South Kivu province. Relations are already strained between Chinese mining companies and local authorities, who say some firms are operating illegally without licenses.""An armed group exchanged fire with police. Five Chinese nationals were kidnapped,"" Major Dieudonne Kasereka, the army spokesman in the region, said.A spokesperson at the Chinese embassy in Congo did not respond to a request for comment. The name of the mine site was not given.In August, the governor of South Kivu, Theo Kasi, suspended the operations of six small Chinese companies, ordering all local and foreign staff to leave the sites. Protests erupted in some areas after companies did not close immediately, local media reported.Separately, President Felix Tshisekedi is reviewing a $6 billion ""infrastructure-for-minerals"" deal with Chinese investors signed under previous president Joseph Kabila.He said previously that some mining contracts could be reviewed because of concerns they are not sufficiently benefiting Congo, which is the world's largest producer of cobalt and Africa's leading miner of copper.Even without disputes over contracts, restive eastern Congo is a difficult place to operate. Various militias fight to control land and natural resources. In recent weeks, the army has clashed with the M23 rebel group a few hundred miles north of this weekend's attack, near the border with Uganda, forcing thousands to flee.On Saturday gunmen killed a ranger of Virunga National Park, the park said. M23 was likely to be responsible, it said.",2

Known for his songs ""Dami Duro"" and ""Fall,"" Davido has been one of Africa's most prominent artists over the last decade and is the African artist with the highest number of followers on Instagram. He launched his fundraiser Wednesday, posting his bank details online and asking celebrity friends and followers to send money, saying his aim was to raise 100 million naira ($243,000) to clear his Rolls-Royce from a port.Ten minutes later, he had already raised $17,000 -- and on Saturday he announced the full amount he received from fans and celebrity friends totaled over $485,000 and would be used for charitable purposes.""In my usual playful manner, I requested a few days ago that my friends and colleagues send money in celebration of my birthday,"" Davido wrote in a statement. ""The response and outcome exceeded my expectations."" The musician, whose real name is David Adeleke, will turn 29 on November 21. He said his aim was now ""to do this fundraising every year to celebrate my birthday and give back to people in need."" He said he would also make a personal donation of $120,000, or 50 million naira, and named a disbursement committee that will identify orphanages that need funding, and distribute the funds accordingly.The appeal for donations initially confused fans, many of whom contributed -- but there was also criticism from social media users who said it was inappropriate for a celebrity to raise money for himself, especially given the levels of poverty in Nigeria.Davido posted regular fundraising updates throughout Wednesday and Thursday, and several of his celebrity friends also jumped on the bandwagon. Nigerian rapper M.I Abaga said he had sent 1 million naira and wrote, ""I want my own hit song with Davido."" ""I'm actually crying,"" the singer wrote after $163,000 had been deposited into his account. ""I really love you guys man."" Davido first suggested he ""might give it all away"" on Friday afternoon, and later that day he released the music video for his new single ""Champion Sound,"" featuring South African rapper Focalistic.It's not the first charitable move from the singer, who donated the proceeds from his music video ""Dolce & Gabbana"" to pandemic relief efforts in April 2020, as well as more than 6,000 bags of rice across his home state of Osun.Earlier this year, he was also spotted giving a free concert to children who surrounded a beach house while he was there with his entourage.

261,"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Friday that the war in Tigray has put Ethiopia on a ""path to destruction"" that could reverberate throughout east Africa, telling CNN that the country's leader, Abiy Ahmed, must fulfill ""his responsibility"" and end violence in the region.Speaking to CNN in Abuja, Nigeria on the sidelines of his tour through Africa, Blinken said ""it is imperative that the fighting stops, and the talking starts"" and reiterated his call for a long-term ceasefire to enable humanitarian assistance.""This has to happen as soon as possible -- with every passing day, what we're seeing is an increase in communal tensions that really risk ripping the country apart and spilling into other countries in the region,"" he said.Blinken urged Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to bring the warring sides together and work to ""end the violence,"" adding: ""That's his responsibility as the leader of the country.""""There's no military solution to the challenges in Ethiopia,"" he said. ""That's a path to destruction for the country, and misery for the people of Ethiopia who deserve a lot better.""The Biden administration last week sanctioned Eritrea's military and its sole political party for their involvement in the ongoing crisis in northern Ethiopia, with Blinken expressing concern about ""the potential for Ethiopia to implode.""But the measures did not target any individuals or organizations directly associated with the Ethiopian government nor the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the former ruling party of Tigray, the two main parties to the conflict.In November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in Tigray to oust the TPLF. The fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people, and given rise to a wave of atrocities that bear the hallmarks of genocide.A joint report released by the Office of UN Commissioner for Human Rights and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission earlier this month found that all parties involved in the conflict had ""committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, some of which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.""Blinken pressed on Nigeria arms salesBlinken spoke to CNN during his first official visit as Secretary of State to sub-Saharan Africa, as the US seeks to throw its diplomatic weight behind efforts to resolve conflicts on the continent and boost its reputation as a partner to African governments.He began the tour in Kenya on Wednesday and will visit Senegal next.But intractable tensions in Ethiopia and Nigeria have formed a large segment of his agenda, and Blinken expressed his concerns about human rights abuses following the killing of unarmed protesters at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, Nigeria's economic capital, in 2020. A much delayed and anticipated report from a Nigerian judicial panel of inquiry concluded on Monday that the shooting was a ""massacre"" at the hands of the military that the government attempted to cover up. Blinken called for action once the panel's report has been officially released. ""There may be reforms that are necessary"" to ensure a similar event is not repeated, he said.""If there are individuals that, as it emerges from this report, are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals,"" he told CNN.In October 2020, Nigerian forces opened fire on peaceful protesters the Lekki toll gate in Lagos. At the time, a CNN investigation into what happened found that the Nigerian army had fired live rounds into the crowd, killing and wounding several people. The shooting quashed Nigeria's fledgling youth protest movement against the police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), but despite scores of videos shot by protesters, which showed the shooting, as well as the dead and wounded, the Nigerian government has consistently denied that a shooting even took place.Pressed on whether the US would continue to provide arms to Nigeria, Blinken cited the Leahy Law which prohibits American military sales to regimes that violate human rights.""If there are units that have committed abuses, we're not going to provide equipment to those units,"" the top American diplomat said.""We look in any instance, and if there are credible allegations that prove out, that we believe meet the standard of the law, yes of course we'll apply the law.""Blinken's maiden tour of Africa forms part of his self-declared mission to rebuild American relationships with the international community after the Trump administration severed many of those links.He told CNN: ""We've done that, and we've done that with not only tremendous energy, but I would argue with real success,"" citing the US' re-joining of the Paris Climate Agreement and its improved relations with the United Nations and the World Health Organization.But he conceded that the State Department was ""learning the lessons"" stemming from United States' chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan after a two-decade war. He defended President Joe Biden's decision to end US involvement in that conflict, a move that was rapidly followed by Afghanistan falling back to the Taliban.""There are always questions about how you do things,"" he added. ""Can you do them more effectively?""",2
262," (CNN)Ten people were shot dead by security forces during anti-coup demonstrations in Sudan's capital Khartoum Wednesday, the civilian-allied Sudanese Central Doctors Committee said on Facebook.Thousands of demonstrators marched on the streets of Khartoum and its twin cities of Bahri and Omdurman, in protest against the military takeover last month. They were met by security forces who fired live bullets and tear gas after mobile phone communications were cut earlier in the day, witnesses told Reuters.""Three civilians were killed by the live ammunition of security forces during today's anti-coup processions in Khartoum...bringing the number of civilians killed by Junta forces during today's processions to 5,"" the Sudanese Central Doctors Committee said on Facebook. The group later reported that a further five people had been shot dead, two in Khartoum and three in Bahri, bringing the total to 10.It added that 70 protesters were injured during the pro-democracy protests.According to Reuters, protesters in Khartoum burned tires and chanted: ""The people are stronger, and retreat is impossible.""Others carried pictures of people killed in previous protests and of Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister who was placed under house arrest during the coup, with the slogan: ""Legitimacy comes from the street, not from the cannons.""Images of protests in other cities circulated on social media. Reuters reported that security forces were heavily deployed on main roads and intersections, using tear gas to prevent gatherings, according to witnesses they had spoken to. Bridges across the River Nile were also closed.One demonstrator in Bahri told Reuters that the air was thick with tear gas and that security forces were using rubber and live bullets.""The main meeting points were completely occupied by security forces,"" said the demonstrator, who asked not to be identified.Mobile internet services in Sudan have been suspended since the coup. This has complicated a campaign of anti-military rallies, strikes and civil disobedience.The Sudanese Congress Party, which was part of the military and civilian coalition, said one of its leaders had been arrested following a raid on his house.On Saturday, hundreds of thousands turned out across Sudan to protest against the coup. Medics said seven people were killed by security forces.",2
263,"Kampala, Uganda (CNN)The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for two separate suicide attacks that killed three people and injured 36 in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, on Tuesday. Two civilians and a police officer were killed in the blasts, police spokesperson Fred Enanga told reporters at a news conference in the city. The ISIS-affiliated Amaq News Agency reported the incident on its Telegram channel on Tuesday, saying three fighters set out with bags loaded with explosives. Two headed toward the Kampala Central Police Station, and the third to the parliament building, where they detonated, it reported. Police said the attacks bore the hallmarks of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist rebel group affiliated with ISIS. In a statement on Tuesday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni raised the number of people injured from 33 to 36. He said three attackers died while detonating their bombs and seven were killed while resisting arrest. A total of 81 suspects have been arrested, Museveni said. ""Apart from hunting the terrorists, the country's strategy of vigilance (alertness), is helping to minimize damage,"" Museveni said.""Therefore, the public should maintain vigilance of checking people at entry points to bus parks, hotels, churches, mosques, markets,"" he added. The two explosions rocked the city center within five minutes of each other. Police said surveillance footage showed an adult male carrying a backpack detonating himself at 10:03 a.m. local time near the Central Police Station. Enanga said the attacker died instantly.Two people were confirmed dead at the scene of the first blast, while 17 others sustained critical injuries, Enanga said in a statement.Three minutes after the first explosion, two suicide bombers on motorcycles were seen detonating themselves near Raja Chambers and Jubilee Insurance Building along the central Kampala Parliament Avenue, Enanga said. The two bombers died and the body of a civilian was also found at the site, he added.Enanga said 33 people were injured in the two blasts; five of them are in critical condition. The wounded are being treated at the Mulago National Referral Hospital.Police pursued a fourth bomber, Enanga said, adding that two further bombs were recovered from his home that will be detonated safely.Following the bombings, police and army personnel cordoned off streets around the blast sites and restricted traffic in the city. Last month, an explosion in Kampala killed at least one person and injured several others. Reuters reported that the Islamic State had claimed responsibility for that blast.",2

265," (Reuters)The son of Libya's late dictator Moammar Gadhafi appeared for nearly the first time in a decade on Sunday to register as a presidential candidate for a December vote planned to help end the years of chaos since his father was toppled.Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, 49, appeared in an electoral commission video in traditional brown robe and turban, and with a gray beard and glasses, signing documents at the election center in the southern town of Sebha.Gadhafi is one of the most prominent -- and controversial -- figures expected to run for president, a list that also includes eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah and parliament speaker Aguila Saleh.However, while his name is one of the best known in Libya, and though he once played a major role in shaping policy before the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that destroyed his family's regime, he has barely been seen for a decade.His formal entry into an election whose rules are still contested by Libya's squabbling factions may also cast new questions over a contest that features candidates viewed in some regions as unacceptable.Despite the public backing of most Libyan factions and foreign powers for elections on December 24, the vote remains in doubt as rival entities bicker over the rules and schedule.A major conference in Paris on Friday agreed to sanction any who disrupt or prevent the vote, but with less than six weeks to go, there is still no agreement on rules to govern who should be able to run.While Gadhafi is likely to play on nostalgia for the era before the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that swept his father from power and ushered in a decade of chaos and violence, analysts say he may not prove to be a front runner.The Gadhafi era is still remembered by many Libyans as one of harsh autocracy, while Saif al-Islam and other former regime figures have been out of power for so long they may find it difficult to mobilize as much support as major rivals.Moammar Gadhafi was captured outside his hometown of Sirte by opposition fighters in October 2011 and summarily shot. Saif al-Islam was seized days later by fighters from the mountainous Zintan region as he tried to flee Libya for Niger.Just over a decade later, Saif al-Islam is now something of a cipher for Libyans. The Zintan fighters kept him for years out of public sight and his views on the crisis are not known.He gave an interview to the New York Times earlier this year, but has not yet made any public appearance speaking directly to Libyans.Complicating his presidential ambitions, Gadhafi was tried in absentia in 2015 by a Tripoli court at which he appeared via videolink from Zintan, and which sentenced him to death for war crimes including killing protesters during the 2011 revolt.He would likely face arrest or other dangers if he appeared publicly in the capital Tripoli. He is also wanted by the International Criminal Court.Educated at the London School of Economics and a fluent English speaker, Saif al-Islam was once seen by many governments as the acceptable, Western-friendly face of Libya, and a possible heir apparent.But when a rebellion broke out in 2011 against Moammar Gadhafi's long rule, Saif al-Islam immediately chose family and clan loyalties over his many friendships in the West, telling Reuters television: ""We fight here in Libya; we die here in Libya.""",2
266," (CNN)Lethal violence committed by Nigeria's military on the night of October 20, 2020 could be considered a ""massacre,"" a government-appointed panel concluded Monday -- contradicting previous official accounts of the incident. The Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution at the Lagos Court of Arbitration had been charged with investigating last year's notorious Lekki toll gate shooting in Lagos, when Nigerian security forces opened fire on young people protesting peacefully against alleged police brutality. Its bombshell report -- which took more than a year to produce -- accuses Nigerian Army officers of having ""shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the national anthem and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre.""  The panel also found ""the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance. The Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement."" The panel's report underscores and repeatedly references previous reporting by CNN, which used time stamps, video data, and geolocation last year to analyze hours of video filmed by protesters.  CNN's investigation found the Nigerian army fired live rounds into crowds at Lekki toll gate, killing and wounding several people. Multiple witnesses also told CNN last year that ambulances were prevented from entering the site to help wounded protesters.  Despite an abundance of video evidence, the Nigerian government has long denied that protesters were shot. Last month, on the one-year anniversary of the shooting, Nigeria's Minister of Information Alhaji Lai Mohammed described the incident as a  ""phantom massacre"" and continued to dismiss CNN's investigation as fake news. The government and military did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the judicial panel's Monday report, which cites CNN dozens of times.  However, Lagos Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the Lagos state government would implement the panel's recommendations, according to local media.""This will help in proper restitution and compensation for everyone who must have been wronged. I want to assure you, a white paper will be issued. I am going to constitute a committee to review the document between two weeks and bring out a white paper,"" Sanwo-Olu said, according to the International Centre for Investigative Reporting.Around 70 victims of police brutality have been awarded a total of 410 million naira (around $1 million) as compensation, the chairperson of the panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi, was quoted in a statement released by Lagos State government Monday. What happenedAhead of the bloody events at Lekki toll gate last year, demonstrators had been taking part in daily protests across Nigeria for nearly two weeks over widespread claims of kidnapping, harassment and extortion by a police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).  The shooting on October 20 would ultimately quash Nigeria's fledgling youth protest movement, known as #EndSARS. The investigating panel was initially set up in October 2020 by the Lagos state government to look into cases of alleged police brutality -- and the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad -- and later tasked with investigating the toll gate incident. The panel's report furthermore alleges cover-up attempts by police, which it says cleaned up the aftermath of the shooting at Lekki toll gate and failed to preserve the scene for investigators. ""The police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets,"" the report says. It also accuses Nigerian authorities of tampering with CCTV footage and removing the bodies of the dead from the scene.The report recommends that all members of the Nigerian Army except for one major general that were deployed to the Lekki toll gate face ""appropriate disciplinary action and be stripped of their status,"" before being dismissed. ""They are not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation,"" it says.It also recommends that the Nigerian army should be ""discouraged"" from intervening in the country's internal security, adding that ""the dark days of military rule is over and more democratic principles and approaches are required to win both the peace and public trust.""The government, it says, should do ""all it can to bridge the gap of distrust with the youth,"" and calls for a monument to be erected at the Lekki Toll Gate with the names of the victims inscribed.Reaction to the report led to an emotional outpouring on social media platform Twitter late on Monday night in Nigeria. Many young people have told CNN they feel vindicated by the findings.  ""Tears filled my eyes. The truth needs no defense,"" said DJ Switch, who live-streamed some of the events of that night and was later forced to flee the country. Akin Olaoye, who was at the frontline of the protest that night, told CNN, ""The findings of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry in its report defining the atrocities at the toll gate as a massacre, is a big win and leads us on a pathway to obtaining justice for many of the innocent victims, survivors and lost souls still lying in unmarked graves.""  Serah Ibrahim, who took part in the #EndSARS protests and also gave evidence at the panel inquiry, told CNN justice and accountability now need to follow. ""I hope all the recommendations are carried out. On one part is admitting it happened, on another part is accountability,"" she said. ""Justice is totally incomplete without accountability,"" Ibrahim added.",2
267,"Sometime after midnight on October 21, Elisha Sunday Ibanga answered a phone call from his older brother's number.The person on the other end of the line -- a stranger -- broke the news that Ibanga's brother, Victor, had been shot dead at the Lekki toll gate, in Lagos, Nigeria, where he had been peacefully protesting against police brutality earlier that night.""The person told me that the police took his body away,"" Ibanga, 24, told CNN.An eyewitness to Victor Sunday Ibanga's death told CNN the 27-year-old entrepreneur was shot in the head during the protest. CNN has obtained and geolocated a photograph of Victor's body lying in a pool of blood and wrapped in the white and green of the Nigerian standard -- one of the same flags gripped by fellow protesters earlier in the evening as they sang the country's national anthem. Ibanga confirmed the photograph is of his brother.The Ibangas are one of several families yet to locate the bodies of their missing loved ones -- protestors at the toll gate -- who dozens of eyewitnesses say were shot at, first by members of the Nigerian army and then hours later by police. Eyewitnesses told CNN they saw the army remove a number of bodies from the scene.What happened on October 20, and into the early hours of October 21, at the eight-lane Lekki toll gate -- a key piece of Lagos' road network -- has stunned the country.The protesters who were present have told CNN it was a ""massacre"" with multiple people killed and dozens wounded.  But local authorities have downplayed that account.Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, admitted to CNN that footage showed uniformed soldiers firing on peaceful protesters but claimed only two demonstrators were killed.  But, he then said there was ""not a scratch of blood"" at the toll gate when he visited. The governor said no families had approached authorities saying they were missing relatives.In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the army denied any involvement, describing reports of the incident as ""fake news,"" before backtracking and saying that soldiers were present but fired their weapons in the air and used blanks, not live rounds.CNN's calls to the Nigerian army have not been returned. But on November 14, during a judicial inquiry into the shooting, army representative Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo said, ""There's no way officers and men will kill their brothers and sisters. I repeat no way. We have those who constantly seek to drive a wedge between us and between the citizens of Nigeria...""The army also said at the hearing that it was the governor who called soldiers to the scene because the police were overrun. The governor has denied this, saying he does not have the authority to call in the army. The army has continued to restate that they did not fire live rounds.But an investigation by CNN into the disputed events has cast doubt on authorities' shifting and changing statements. Evidence of bullet casings from the scene match those used by the Nigerian army when shooting live rounds, according to current and former Nigerian military officials. Verified video footage -- using timestamps and data from the video files -- shows soldiers who appear to be shooting in the direction of protesters. And accounts from eyewitnesses establish that after the army withdrew, a second round of shooting happened later in the evening.Since Elisha Sunday Ibanga learned of his brother's death, he has been visiting hospitals in a desperate search for his remains. ""My mother, my sisters, all my family are in prayer, just to see if we can find out and know where my brother's dead body is,"" he said. The bodies of other protesters are nowhere to be found.Peace Okon, 24, hasn't seen her younger brother Wisdom, 18, since he went to the protest the night of the shooting. ""He just came back from work on that Tuesday, ate his food and went there,"" Okon told CNN.She started worrying when he didn't arrive home that night. By the next morning, Okon was out searching for him. ""I've gone to hospitals, I've gone to police stations, I've gone to everywhere. I can't find him,"" she said.Her brother had only moved to Lagos a few weeks before the protest -- Okon had helped him find a job as a cleaner at a bank. She says he didn't know anyone at the protest and had never been to one before.Okon said she wants the Nigerian authorities to tell her if her brother is alive and detained or dead.The shootings at Lekki toll gate followed weeks of ""#EndSARS"" protests against police brutality that had burst onto the streets of cities across Nigeria.For almost a fortnight, thousands of young Nigerians mostly under 30 -- a demographic that makes up 40% of the country's population -- protested, with calls for an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a police unit widely and repeatedly accused of kidnapping, harassment and extortion.Police had agreed to disband the controversial unit but protests continued. It would be the fourth time it was being disbanded.    There were peaceful marches, candlelight vigils, multi-faith prayer sessions and DJ performances that attracted backing and solidarity from celebrities, the Nigerian diaspora and supporters around the world. The movement quickly widened beyond police brutality to other grievances -- capturing the frustrations of a young population demanding an end to bad governance in the oil-rich country.Lekki, a relatively affluent suburb of Lagos, and the toll gate became a focal point of the movement.However, about 10 days into the protests, the demonstrations were hijacked by ""thugs and sponsored hoodlums"" who attacked protesters, causing deaths and injuries, according to Amnesty International Nigeria.  In response, on October 20, hours before the shooting, Governor Sanwo-Olu imposed a strict curfew starting at 4 p.m. following looting and vandalism in other parts of the state.It was later moved to 9 p.m. to allow commuters to get home. The timeline for when the curfew was imposed has become a point of contention between the Governor and the military. The army said their soldiers were unaware of the change to the later time, according to the army spokesperson's testimony to the eight-person judicial panel on November 14.For 24 hours, only essential service providers were to be allowed on the streets of the 20-million strong city.Testimony from dozens of eyewitnesses and family members interviewed by CNN and a forensic examination of hours of video and dozens of photographs captured before, during and after the two shooting incidents show how a fledgling protest movement was all but extinguished by the very thing Nigerians were demonstrating against. Less than three hours after the original curfew time came into effect, army trucks left the Bonny Camp barracks on Victoria Island and headed towards the toll gate plaza and the protesters, according to videos reviewed by CNN.Two eyewitnesses told CNN they saw soldiers arriving in a Toyota Hilux pickup truck with ""OP Awatse"" written on it -- the name of a joint military task force that operates in Lagos State.Videos examined by CNN show the army trucks approaching the protesters from both sides of the toll gate -- barricading them in. DJ Switch, a local musician whose real name is Obianuju Catherine Udeh, was streaming live on Instagram when it all happened and the shooting began.   The shooting started almost immediately, with no warning given. Panic ensued as protesters attempted to flee.""There was a guy that was running, and he just... he fell, and we looked at him. He was shot in the back,"" DJ Switch, 29, told CNN, as she tried to talk during an interview while crying.""Please explain to me how, in which part of the world, do you go to a protest with live bullets,"" she said.From multiple videos, CNN has pieced together a timeline that shows that shooting by the army lasted from 6:43 p.m. until at least 8:24 p.m., according to video evidence.The videos capturing some of those 101 minutes tell a story of terror and chaos. They show graphic injuries and people bleeding on the ground.One eyewitness, Sarah, whose last name we're not publishing for her safety, told CNN that the soldiers shot in the air but also directly at protesters.""They pointed their guns at us and they started shooting,"" she said. ""They were shooting in the air, they were shooting at us, they were shooting everywhere.""Some chanted: ""We are peaceful protesters"" and ""End Sars, we no go gree [pidgin for we will not agree, or give in].""""They're shooting, they're shooting,"" another person screams in one of the videos. Cries of ""Na lie, na lie [exclamations of disbelief in pidgin]"" can also be heard.In several of the videos, reviewed and verified by CNN, some of the protesters can be seen carrying bodies, the flashlights on their phones the only thing illuminating the darkness as the sound of ambulance sirens wail in the background. It is not known whether these were dead or injured protesters.In another, there are several injured people, some on the ground bleeding while defiant protesters continued to wave Nigerian flags.Injured people whom CNN has confirmed were present at the toll gate started arriving in local hospitals -- carried by civilians -- from 7:19 p.m. while the shooting was still ongoing, according to videos analyzed by CNN.CNN has also seen and verified footage from one man who used his car as a makeshift ambulance and transported people to hospital.Separately, Dr. Ayo Aranmolate, executive medical director at Grandville medical center, told CNN he and his colleagues received around 15 injured people that night with various gunshot wounds and cuts. None of the people they treated died, he added.""We referred some for treatment to other hospitals,"" Dr. Aranmolate said. ""One of the victims had to have his leg amputated.""The army has denied that anyone was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds, and that they only shot into the air. Speaking in front of the judicial panel, the army spokesman Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo continued to deny that anyone was shot.Multiple eyewitnesses told CNN that ambulances were prevented from reaching the scene by the authorities.A video filmed at 8:49 p.m., according to metadata, shows ambulance workers in a van at the scene saying they are unable to get through.When contacted by CNN to share the findings of this investigation, a Lagos State government spokesman declined to comment. ""Talking about that subject now will be sub-judicial since the matter is already before a panel of inquiry. Until the panel concludes its investigation, the subject will not be open to any discussion or comment by any State official,"" the spokesperson said.DJ Switch said she wanted people to see what was happening which is why she started broadcasting.""I didn't want anybody to come on and twist the story. I wanted people to see. So, I just went live.""At one point during the broadcast, there were attempts to resuscitate a man in red clothing who had passed out.Later, DJ Switch can be seen helping to extract a bullet lodged in another man's thigh as he screams in agony. Someone in the crowd says, ""you will live, you will not die.""As the live broadcast ends, people are still trying to apply CPR on the man in red, while DJ Switch can be heard saying, ""this guy is dying.""DJ Switch told CNN that protesters lifted bodies with bullet wounds and put them at the soldiers' feet.""I said, why are you killing us? Why are you doing this,"" she said. ""He expressly told me: 'I am acting on orders from above.'""CNN has examined bullet casings found at the scene and confirmed with current and former Nigerian military sources that the bullet casings match those used by the army. Two ballistics experts have also confirmed with CNN that the shape of the bullet casings indicate they used live rounds, which contradicts the army's claim they fired blanks.And working with the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, CNN has established that several of the bullets from the Lekki toll gate originated from Serbia. Export documents CNN has seen show that Nigeria purchased weaponry from Serbia almost every year between 2005 and 2016.After the army withdrew from the scene, members of the police, including the SARS police unit -- disbanded by authorities on 11 October -- moved in, according to multiple eyewitnesses CNN spoke with.In a video obtained by CNN and geolocated to Lekki toll gate at 2:36 a.m., one eyewitness, Legend, whose second name we're not publishing for his safety, can be seen with the Nigerian flag around his head saying, ""...my hand is broken, my leg is broken, and police are still shooting at us."" ""They are shooting anything that moves outside...Stay safe through the night. And if I don't make it through the night let it be known that I died fighting for our freedom, for what we believe in.""Legend, who survived, told CNN his father was a police officer and that he recognized the SARS uniform. About 200 protesters remained at the toll gate when witnesses say police and SARS arrived, he added.""I couldn't count how many dead because I was running for my life,"" Legend said. ""If I stood my ground five more seconds, I would be dead.""While CNN has not been able to independently verify that SARS members were present, multiple eyewitnesses said they saw police officers, accompanied by officers from the unit, at the scene after the army left.A Lagos State police spokesman declined to comment because of the ongoing panel investigation. But police have denied any use of force against protesters on Twitter, saying, ""....our police officers never resorted to use of unlawful force or shooting at the protesters."" The widespread looting and damage that occurred across Lagos in the aftermath of the Lekki toll gate shooting has led to the authorities clamping down on people who took part in the protests.Many feel they are being scapegoated for taking part in peaceful protests -- wrongly blamed for the looting -- and fear has descended on the movement since the shooting.Moe Odele, a prominent lawyer who was giving legal advice to demonstrators arrested during the protests, says she was recently prevented from leaving the country after her passport was seized. Odele told CNN that her passport has since been returned.The country's central bank has obtained a 90-day court order freezing the accounts of those who took part in the demonstrations, according to media reports, while a journalist who covered the protests was arrested and detained for five days before being freed on bail. Several eyewitnesses have fled the country, while others are living in safe houses. Some told CNN they were offered money to recant their initial testimonies.CNN has seen some of the messages received, though it is unclear who is sending them.  ""We're hiding because our lives are in danger,"" an eyewitness named Sarah told CNN. ""We can't go out, our jobs are on hold right now, and it's really sad because we did nothing wrong.""""All we did was ask for change.""",2
268,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)When Adesola heard about the shooting at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos on October 20, 2020, she immediately thought of her son who had earlier left home to join the hundreds of young people protesting against police brutality at the site.  In a blind panic, she called his phone, but there was no answer. She immediately hailed a passing motorcycle taxi, known locally as an Okada, and raced to the scene. But nothing could have prepared her for the harrowing scenes she witnessed when she got there, she said.   ""While I was looking for my son... I saw people running and someone was in the gutter and had an iron bar in his eye. The person was already dead,"" she recalled.One year on from the shooting by security forces that quashed Nigeria's fledgling youth protest movement, known as #EndSARS, Adesola (not her real name) is speaking to CNN on the condition of anonymity, for fear of recriminations. We have also withheld her son's name at her request. ""We got there around 5 or 6 am,"" she said in her first sit-down interview. ""We saw a lot of people. There was a child holding a Nigerian flag lying dead, there was a bullet wound on the side of his body.   ""He was a small boy and there were a lot of people there,"" she told CNN from a makeshift wooden structure where she ekes out a living selling cold beverages. 'He died in my arms' As Adesola surveyed the scenes of chaos and stepped over the hastily discarded belongings of panicked protesters, she spotted a familiar figure lying in a pool of blood on the ground, wearing just one shoe.   ""When I saw my son, I shouted and held him... The blood was too much, there was a bullet wound on his chest. His clothes were torn and the bullet had come out of his back,"" she said, weeping as she recounted the painful moment.Despite his injuries, she discovered her son was still alive.   ""I saw other people carrying their relatives, so I tried to carry him because he was still breathing at that moment. I called for help and people came to help me put him in a vehicle,"" she said. ""He was looking at us while we were carrying him. He was just screaming 'ah, ah,' in pain.""   They tried desperately to revive him in the car, but he didn't make it, she told CNN.  ""He died in my arms,"" Adesola said. ""I was shouting and I couldn't keep calm."" Her son was buried almost immediately in line with Muslim burial rites.  He was 32 and left behind two children, 14 and nine, who had also lost their mother in undisclosed circumstances a few years earlier. No official death tollAdesola says she is thankful she was able to find her son's body. Others were not so fortunate.  CNN spoke to several families during an investigation last year who were yet to locate the bodies of their missing loved ones -- protesters at the toll gate -- who dozens of eyewitnesses say were shot at, first by members of the Nigerian army and then hours later by police.Witnesses told CNN that ambulances were stopped from entering by Nigerian authorities.There is no official death toll, but an Amnesty International investigation found that at least 12 people died at Lekki toll gate and another site on October 20. Eyewitnesses told CNN they saw the army remove a number of bodies from the scene. The CNN investigation pieced together what happened when the Nigerian army and later the police opened fire on civilians as they protested police brutality.   It used time stamps, video data, and geolocation to analyze hours of video shot by protesters -- tracking the army's movements to the Lekki toll gate where protests had been taking place for almost two weeks. Video shot by an eyewitness appears to show the army shooting toward the crowd. The Nigerian government threatened to sanction CNN for its report. The Nigerian Army's account of what happened has shifted over time.  In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the army denied any involvement, describing reports of the incident as ""fake news,"" before backtracking and saying that soldiers were present but fired their weapons in the air and used blanks.It said that hoodlums were mixed into the crowds of protesters.On November 14, during a judicial inquiry into the shooting, army representative Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo (who has since been promoted to the rank of major general) admitted that the soldiers at the scene had live rounds but continued to deny that anyone was shot.""There's no way officers and men will kill their brothers and sisters. I repeat no way. We have those who constantly seek to drive a wedge between us and between the citizens of Nigeria...,"" he said at the time.   Protesters and witnesses posted several videos in which bullet casings were displayed which they say were recovered from the scene. At the time of the incident, police denied shooting anyone.CNN has made renewed attempts to obtain comments for this latest report from the Nigerian armed forces, police, and the federal government, but has received no response.  A protest movement silencedThe #EndSARS protests lasted for nearly two weeks in October 2020 before they were silenced by the shooting at the Lekki toll gate. Angry young Nigerians took to the streets, blocking major roads across cities in Africa's most populous nation, in largely peaceful protests. They marched in tens of thousands chanting ""Enough is Enough"" against police brutality and violence.   Their initial demands were for a notorious police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, or SARS, to be shut down, but the marches morphed into protests campaigning for police reform and an end to bad governance in the oil-rich country.  During the protests, participants erected tents and DJ booths at various sites across the country and held multi-faith prayer sessions as well as a ""festival of lights,"" to honor the victims of police brutality, held at the now-infamous Lekki toll gate.  Adesola questions why the protesters were dispersed with such brutal force that night.  ""Even if the government wanted to chase them from the place, they were not supposed to shoot. They could have asked them to stop and not shoot. Everyone could have found their way.""   Adesola says her son took part in the protests as ""a concerned Nigerian,"" and in what would be their final phone call, he described a scene of calm where people were protesting peacefully and had come prepared to camp overnight.   ""All his mates had been going there and when he came back from work on that day, he said he was going to join his friends. When he got there, he called me and said a lot of people were there. Some were sleeping there with their mattress and had brought their cooking gas. If the soldiers did not come, things would have gone well without any problems,"" she said.   No accountability  One year on from the Lekki toll gate shootings, and no one has taken responsibility for what happened that night, nor has anyone been held to account. In a short report released Tuesday, titled ""Nigeria: A Year On, No Justice for #EndSARS Crackdown,"" Human Rights Watch said: ""The prospects for accountability remain inconclusive and bleak. Nigerian authorities should take concrete and decisive steps to ensure that those implicated in abuses against protesters are held accountable.""The judicial hearing set up in October 2020 by the Lagos state government to look into cases of police brutality -- and the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad -- and to investigate the tollgate incident has been beset with delays and other issues.  Last month, it abruptly suspended sitting, saying it did not have enough time to complete its reports on the cases, including the Lekki shooting. It reopened briefly a few weeks later to hear additional testimonies and ended its sitting Monday. However, its report is still being prepared. ""Nigeria's authorities should take effective steps toward accountability to show victims that their loss, pain, and suffering is not in vain,"" said Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""Anything less will worsen distrust of the government and reinforce the perception that the lives of citizens do not matter."" Many Nigerians believe the issues that drew the protests 12 months ago still persist -- and those who were there that fateful night are still seeking justice.  DJ Switch, a local musician whose real name is Obianuju Catherine Udeh, was at the protest and live-streamed much of the evening on her Instagram page.   A year later she recalls how she thought they were all going to die.  ""I thought it was the end for all of us there. You know, I mean when you sing the national anthem and wave your flag, your Nigerian flag, and the shooting doesn't stop, you only have one thought left in your mind,"" she said.  Soon after the shootings, DJ Switch says she had to flee Nigeria, afraid for her safety, and she hasn't been back since.  ""Justice is there waiting to be done, who's going to do it? Young people are asking every day for accountability, who's willing to be responsible -- to take responsibility,"" she said.   Now Adesola is picking up the pieces after her eldest son's death. Asked what she would say if she could talk directly to the Nigerian government, she said: ""I will say to them the same thing I am saying to you. ""I cannot be lying about my child's death. I will show them his grave."" ",2
269,"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN)A senior Nigerian minister lashed out against CNN Thursday, saying the network should be sanctioned over its investigation, which uncovered evidence that the Nigerian army and police opened fire on unarmed protestors on October 20.CNN's investigation focused on a demonstration against police brutality, led by the largely peaceful ""#EndSARS"" movement.Read and watch CNN's full investigation hereMinister for Information and Culture Lai Mohammed Thursday dismissed the CNN investigation as ""fake news"" and ""misinformation,"" repeatedly denying the military used live rounds against protesters.""Like everyone else, I watched the CNN report. I must tell you that it reinforces the disinformation that is going around, and it is blatantly irresponsible and a poor piece of journalistic work by a reputable international news organization,"" he told reporters at a press conference in Abuja, in the most significant federal government response so far to the October 20 violence.""This is very serious and CNN should be sanctioned for that,"" he said.CNN stands by its investigation, a company spokesperson said.""Our reporting was carefully and meticulously researched, and we stand by it,"" the spokesperson said via email.The report was based on testimony from dozens of witnesses, and photos and video obtained and geolocated by CNN. It painted a picture of how members of the Nigerian army and the police shot at the crowd, killing at least one person and wounding dozens more.CNN verified photos and videos acquired from multiple eyewitnesses and protesters using timestamps and other data from the video files. Video footage shows soldiers who appear to be shooting in the direction of protesters. And accounts from eyewitnesses established that after the army withdrew, a second round of shooting happened later in the evening.Prior to publishing the report, CNN tried multiple times to elicit comment from the Nigerian army and police. A Lagos State police spokesman declined to comment because of an ongoing investigation. While a statement from the Lagos State government said that there would be no comment while a judicial tribunal was underway. CNN also included comments from army representative Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo, testifying before the tribunal. He denied that soldiers would shoot at Nigerian citizens.The investigation was broadcast and published on Wednesday and cast doubt on Nigerian authorities' shifting and changing statements over what happened at the protest at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos.Addressing reporters, Mohammed insisted that ""the military did not shoot at the protesters at the toll gate"" but fired blank ammunitions into the air, blaming looters for the violence which broke out on the night of October 20.""Six soldiers and 37 policemen were killed all over the country during the crisis,"" Mohammed said.""CNN relied heavily on unreliable and possibly doctored videos as well as information sources from questionable sources to reach these conclusions,"" he continued.He did not provide any evidence the videos were doctored.Read and watch CNN's full investigation hereThe CNN report included evidence that bullet casings from the scene matched those used by the Nigerian army when shooting live rounds, according to current and former Nigerian military officials.Two ballistics experts also confirmed with CNN that the shape of the bullet casings indicate they used live rounds, which contradicts the army's claim they fired blanks.While the Minister for Information and Culture asserted that ""not a single family"" has reported the death of relatives during the protest on October 20, the Chief Coroner of Lagos State has since issued a public call for all those who have ""lost loved ones between 19 -- 27 October 2020"" to come forward and provide evidence which could assist in the ""identification exercise."" During his press briefing on Thursday, the Minister denied reports of fatalities at the protest.""As I said earlier, what started as a peaceful protest against police brutality quickly degenerated into incredible violence despite an immediate response to the demands by the government,"" he said.""While we await the Judicial Panel in Lagos to unravel what transpired at the Lekki toll gate, what we can say, based on testimonies available in the public space, is that the world may have just witnessed, for the very first time ever, a massacre without bodies,"" he added.According to Mohammed, the National Economic Council (NEC) directed the ""immediate establishment"" of a state-based judicial panel of inquiry on October 15 -- before the Lekki toll gate incident, but after protests against violence had begun -- to investigate complaints of police brutality and extrajudicial killings.Eyewitnesses have since told CNN that the government's comments are ""lies,"" making them feel as though they had ""hallucinated the whole event.""""Haven't they hurt us enough? I still close my eyes and see the blood and hear the screams,"" another eyewitness said.During the press conference, Mohammed said the federal government continues to be ""very satisfied"" with the role played by security agencies -- especially the military and police -- through the protests.",2
270," (CNN)It was supposed to be the key piece of evidence. But when it came, the Lagos State government's security camera footage of the Lekki toll gate shooting did not capture everything.The footage from the security camera overlooking the toll gate in Lagos, Nigeria was played during Saturday's session of an eight-person judicial panel set up to investigate police brutality and the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad -- the primary focus of thousands-strong protests in the city that lasted for almost two weeks in October.The panel is also charged by the Lagos State government with probing the shooting of protesters at the Lekki toll gate on the evening of October 20 and into the early hours of October 21.CNN obtained a copy of the CCTV footage ahead of the panel's sitting on Saturday and matched it up to verified footage published as part of an investigation last week into the events at the toll gate.The footage corroborates the timings CNN reported for the gunshots fired by the army. It also shows soldiers approaching protesters and firing shots.What is perhaps most notable is what's missing. At 6:47 p.m., the moment when CNN has video of the army appearing to fire directly at protesters, the surveillance camera pans away from the area. The Lekki Concession Company (LCC), the firm that operates the toll gate in a public-private partnership, says its staff were sent home before an evening curfew, imposed by the State's Governor, came into effect.The surveillance camera pans left and tilts up before reframing and struggling for focus. It is unclear if the camera pans away deliberately or whether the pan away is a poor choice by the CCTV operator.The LCC had previously testified at the panel on November 3 that the recording stopped at around 8 p.m. because it was tampered with.The surveillance footage once again raises questions about the investigation into what happened at the Lekki toll gate protest -- and why surveillance video from the evening does not provide a more complete picture.In the aftermath of CNN's investigation, the United States and the United Kingdom have called on Nigeria to ensure that its investigation is free and fair.Read and watch the full investigationOn Monday, the UK parliament debated a petition seeking to sanction the Nigerian government and the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) over alleged human rights abuses.The foreign office also released a statement saying: ""The Foreign Secretary has been clear that the Nigerian government must urgently investigate reports of brutality at the hands of the security forces and hold those responsible to account.""It is important that the police in Nigeria respect human rights. We have been working with Nigeria to support reforms to ensure this happens.""The police said it would not comment until after the judicial inquiry. However, in a tweet in early November, it denied shooting at protesters.""...our police officers never resorted to use of unlawful force or shooting at the protesters as alleged in the report.""Since the shooting, which brought an end to the protest movement in Africa's most populous country, the army has made many shifting statements about how it engaged with the peaceful demonstrators.The army has repeatedly said the soldiers deployed to the toll gate fired into the air and not at protesters directly.  The army did not respond to multiple requests from CNN for comment. On Twitter, it repeatedly stamped news accounts of the shooting as ""Fake News.""However, social media footage -- submitted by the army's own counsel to the panel on Saturday -- featured an eyewitness saying, ""they are shooting at protesters."" It appeared to be the same video that CNN geo-located which was shot from the nearby Oriental Hotel in Lekki on October 20.On Saturday, army spokesman Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo also contradicted previous testimony to the judicial panel by saying that the army was equipped on the night with live rounds.""For the protection of the force, we carried live bullets in case they were attacked. But the soldiers who formed the firing team, who fired as you could see in the video [...] carried magazines charged with blank ammunition.""CNN's investigation had revealed the use of live ammunition at the toll gate, based on analysis carried out by ballistics experts and conversations with military sources.The army has insisted that only blanks were used.Adesina Ogunlana, a lawyer who is representing some of the ""#EndSARS"" protesters at the judicial panel, told CNN another protester died recently after falling into a coma from injuries sustained on October 20.""I saw one of them that was shot at and taken to Reddington (Hospital),"" Ogunlana said. ""About ... three Sundays ago, I was there and there was this person shot in the head. He's dead now."" ""What blanks lodge in somebody's brain and stay there and send him to a coma, killing him?""CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death of this person.On Saturday, Brigadier Taiwo once again rejected any responsibility by the army for deaths of protesters, saying that one of the deaths was from ""blunt force trauma to the head on Admiralty Way ... 3 kilometers away from the Lekki toll gate. And the second person at Yaba.""""It had nothing whatsoever to do with the Lekki toll gate,"" he said.In response to CNN's investigation, the Nigerian government said the news organization should be sanctioned and alleged that doctored videos were used, describing the reporting as ""fake news"" and ""misinformation.""CNN stands by its investigation, a company spokesperson said.""Our reporting was carefully and meticulously researched, and we stand by it,"" the spokesperson said via email.In a letter addressed to CNN on November 23, Nigeria's Ministry of Information demanded an internal investigation into CNN's reporting, as a ""form of remediation"" and to ""determine whether it met the basic standards of journalism."" The Minister added in the letter that the ""Federal Government reserves the right to take any action within its laws to prevent CNN from aggravating the #EndSARS crisis."" CNN's November 19 report included photos and videos of gunshots, the wounded, and victims. The videos, acquired from multiple eyewitnesses and protesters, were verified in interviews, and by using timestamps and other data from the media files.Read and watch the full investigationOgunlana, the lawyer representing some of the protesters, said the evidence the army continues to submit to the judicial panel is undermining its defense.""There's a proverb among my people,"" Ogunlana said.

272,"Lagos Island, Nigeria (CNN)Standing on the sand next to a building hollowed out by the churning sea, Sheriff Elegushi points far out into the Atlantic Ocean to where his ancestral home once stood. ""Over there was where we had our tarred road before,"" Elegushi said. ""We also had our electricity poles there and a health center ... You can see the remaining particles,"" he adds, pointing to the debris.Elegushi -- a leader in the Okun Alfa community on Nigeria's Lagos Island -- spoke to CNN some 1,500 meters from where Alpha Beach, a popular tourist destination, used to be. The people here no longer even call this stretch of sand Alpha Beach. They consider it long gone.The resort's extinction has left the Okun Alfa community and those around it paralyzed, and is just one of many losses for the people here, whose neighborhoods have been ravaged by frequent tidal surges fueled both by ​the climate crisis and questionable urban planning.This is no sleepy island, but ​rather Lagos' buzzing central business district​. It is densely packed with residential homes and high-rise buildings. The residents of Okun Alfa worry that complete submersion of their community is no longer a matter of if, but when. ​Huge swaths of Okun Alfa's landscape ​have been consumed by the sea, says the convener of the community's ocean surge response, Oladotun Hassan. It's half the size it once was. Properties that were nowhere near the ocean 10 years ago now sit just a few steps away.""Many years ago, we took long treks to get to the sea,"" said Elegushi. ""There were no houses close to the shore.""He added that for decades, Okun Alfa's residents have been moving their homes further and further back from the shoreline, as floods and sea level rise erode the coast they once looked out over. But there's a limit to how far back they can move. ""There is no more land for us to move to,"" said Elegushi. On Lagos Island, the coastline is even approaching the palace of Okun Alfa's traditional ruler, Chief Elegushi Atewolara Yusuf. And this is his new one -- his older one has already been washed away by the sea.""I lost my palace. You can see that we just built this (new palace). The former palace is inside the ocean.""As the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow enter the most intensive phase of negotiations, the money needed for developing nations to adapt to the climate crisis is proving to be one of the most contentious issues.  The COP26 presidency has sought to get rich nations to fill the gap and pay their fair share on a promised $100 billion a year by 2020 for the Global South to adapt to changes like these on Lagos Island. Industrialized nations have contributed far more to the crisis than developing ones, yet they have missed this target and though more money is being pledged in Glasgow, it is only trickling in. A problem with management, climate or both?A projection on sea-level rise by the University of Plymouth showed that an increase of just 1 to 3 meters ""will have a catastrophic effect on the human activities"" in Nigeria's coastal environments, including Lagos, a low-lying city on the Atlantic coast. ​Scientists say that a rise of up to one meter could happen by 2100 if emissions levels do not decrease dramatically.Another study, published in Nature, found that some of the world's low-lying coastal cities could be permanently submerged by ​then.But, like so many of the worst impacts of ​the climate crisis, humans' management of the natural and built world are exacerbating problems like receding coastlines. On Lagos Island community leaders fault the construction of an entirely new coastal city, called ""Eko Atlantic."" They say the project has worsened the surge of water towards their part of the coastline, pushing their homes underwater. The city is being built on land reclaimed from the Atlantic, on a former beach on Lagos' Victoria Island. A Nigerian environmental activist, Similade Adeodun, told CNN the construction of Eko Atlantic was making the usual methods ​of adapting to sea level rise in Okun Alfa more challenging. ""Land reclamation is a major problem in combating rising sea levels and building resilience,"" said Adeodun. ""Eko Atlantic project is pushing the water that was occupying where they are reclaiming now back to neighboring coastal communities ... So this has increased sea surge in places like Okun Alfa. The higher the water goes, the more devastating the impact,"" he said.David Frame, the managing director of Eko Atlantic, denies the project is creating these problems.""That's not the case,"" said Frame in an interview with CNN. ""We engaged consultants to design the structure of the sea wall and the reclamation process of Eko Atlantic, and they have monitored that progress from the beginning.""He explained that the consultants' role was to ensure dredging contractors did not take sand from the seabed beyond a point known as the ""Minus 15 Contour."" ""That is the point at which, if you dredge closer to the shoreline, you are going to affect the coastline.""He said the method used conformed with international standards. ""So the dredging operation has not caused any erosion on the coastline."" But Tajudeen, another community leader in Okun Alfa, doesn't buy it. ""Eko Atlantic has given us a very serious problem,"" he said. ""The ocean has been disturbing us; breaking houses including those that are not close to the shore. It just comes and breaks them. Some people built concrete block houses with many rooms but they are now sleeping in makeshift structures made with planks.""Tajudeen told CNN that a protective barrier erected by the government 10 years ago has helped to reduce tidal surges in Okun Alfa.""After numerous complaints, the government erected breakers in parts of the ocean. Without the breakers, there wouldn't have been anyone left in this village,"" he said.But just looking at the barriers, it's clear their construction was never fully completed.That's why there is still a continuous penetration of seawater into the land, Elegushi said.""The job was stopped. That's why water is still penetrating. The government promised to do more. This was just half of it,"" he added.Another resident, Jidah Saed, said Okun Alfa isn't yet safe.""When they started the breakers in 2011, the whole idea was to extend it by about 1,000 meters. Unfortunately, they were not able to complete the project. If they had finished it, then we would be safe,"" Jidah told CNN.Lagos authorities did not respond to CNN's request for comment but a statement from the Lagos State Government in 2018 said ""the construction is a continuous project subject to availability of funds"" and urged communities ""to fulfil their civic responsibility to the government by paying their taxes promptly.""An official Lagos website published a statement by the state surveyor-general in June saying that Eko Atlantic City ""is a unique megacity built on new ideas and innovation for a Greater Lagos that is environmentally friendly and sustainable.""Eko Atlantic developers say the project is a ​way of preventing parts of Lagos Island from being eaten away by erosion.""Victoria Island, V.I extension, Phase One Lekki, and the best part of Phase Two of Lekki are protected permanently by Eko Atlantic,"" said Frame of Eko Atlantic.Nigeria calls for more foreign climate funding Okun Alfa's ocean surge response convener Hassan explains that local financing will be insufficient in addressing Nigeria's climate issues​. He also cites the need for the country to access more ecological funding.Garba Shehu, a spokeman for President Muhammadu Buhari, told CNN in a statement that more funding to adapt to problems like receding coastlines was crucial. It has been a key ask from Nigeria at COP26 talks.""We are 100% committed to the overall ​(goal) of zero-emissions ... Then, of course, we want the rich nations to fulfill their obligation by paying ​the $100 billion in the Paris Accord,"" Sherbu said.​In 2009, developed countries agreed to transfer $100 billion a year ​by 2020 to developing nations to help them reduce their greenhouse gases and adapt to the climate crisis. That target still hasn't been met and developing nations at COP26 are complaining that not enough of that money is going to adapation. ""We are committed already to 20% reduction (of emissions) as a national objective; with funding support, we are ready for 45% or so by 2030,"" Shehu added.Environmentalist Adeodun argued that Nigeria has been unable to receive enough funding for climate adaptation due to ""mismanagement"" in the country. He is very careful to not say directly where ​he believes previous funds allocated for Nigeria's efforts have gone. ""Because of mismanagement, Nigeria is unable to access enough funding that will accelerate our resilience and adaptation projects and programs,"" Adeodun said. ""If Nigeria is going to be asking for support, it should be in terms of upscaling our projects and solutions to climate issues."" ",2
273," (CNN)Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed pledged to bury his government's enemies ""with our blood"" last week, in an inflammatory speech marking the one-year anniversary of the war in the country's northern Tigray region.""We will bury this enemy with our blood and bones and make the glory of Ethiopia high again,"" Abiy said at the military headquarters in the capital, Addis Ababa, on Wednesday, a day after declaring a national state of emergency and urging Ethiopians to take up arms to fight advancing Tigrayan forces.The speech doubled down on comments the Nobel Peace laureate made in an earlier Facebook post urging supporters to ""march ... with any weapon and resources they have to defend, repulse and bury the terrorist TPLF."" The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which ruled the country for more than three decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, has been designated a terrorist group by the current government.Abiy's post was removed by Facebook for violating its policies against inciting and supporting violence. But the prime minister's spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, denies that it and other recent statements by Abiy amount to calls for violence.""The prime minister calling upon the Ethiopian people to defend their city, to defend their communities, to defend their country"" is part of the government's constitutional responsibility to ward off any attacks, Billene told CNN's Becky Anderson in an interview Tuesday, adding, ""The prime minister is not asking people to go and attack their counterparts and their brothers and sisters."" Billene also said the Ethiopian government has contested Facebook's removal of Abiy's post, adding that it was ""not necessarily"" a call ""to arm everybody and descend into civil chaos, but ... about being vigilant in their communities.""More than a year of warThe TPLF has been battling Ethiopia's military since the prime minister accused the group of attacking a federal army base and ordered an offensive in Tigray last November. The war has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million and fueled famine. A series of CNN investigations have also uncovered a range of atrocities committed by forces from the Ethiopian government and Eritrea during the year-long war in Tigray. All actors in the conflict have been accused of committing human rights abuses. Throughout the interview, Billene repeatedly accused CNN and other western media outlets of misrepresenting the conflict in Ethiopia and contributing to ""hysteria"" that Addis Ababa was under siege. For the TPLF's part, spokesman Getachew Reda also told Anderson on Tuesday that the group was ""not interested in power, we're not interested in territory.""""Abiy's bombers are killing our children day in and day out, for God's sakes, and we have to make sure those 'dogs of war' are restrained and we'll continue to take measures,"" Getachew said, referring to the ongoing conflict in Tigray.Ethiopia's military has urged veterans to rejoin the army as the TPLF and allied rebels approached the capital in recent days. Nine groups opposing the government -- a broad coalition of armed groups and political actors representing different regional and ethnic interests, including the TPLF -- formed a new alliance last Friday ""in response to the scores of crises facing the country"" and to fight against the ""genocidal regime of Ethiopia,"" according to the leader of one of the groups.Getachew said that fighters aligned with the TPLF would continue to fight until there was ""readiness on the part of Abiy's government"" to negotiate a ceasefire, and that the TPLF would be ""more than glad to extend the olive branch as well.""Yet the TPLF categorically rejected a unilateral ceasefire declared by Ethiopia's government in June, when Tigrayan forces retook the regional capital Mekelle. Since then, the fighting has spread beyond Tigray's borders into the neighboring Amhara and Afar regions. The ongoing conflict has taken an undeniable toll on civilians. In a statement last week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for unrestricted humanitarian access to Tigray, Amhara and Afar. The UN also said no aid convoys with supplies had been able to enter Tigray since mid-October.A joint investigation by the UN Human Rights Office and Ethiopia's state-appointed human rights commission (EHRC) into the conflict in Tigray released on November 3 found that atrocities had been committed on all sides, including the denial of access to humanitarian relief. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said that while the investigation had uncovered violations linked to the Ethiopian military and allied forces, it had also observed ""huge allegations of abuses by the Tigrayan forces"" since Ethiopia declared the ceasefire in June.  Getachew told CNN that he ""categorically"" rejected the joint report because of the EHRC's involvement, and called for an independent investigation. Tigrayans, human rights groups and other observers have also flagged concerns about the investigation's independence from government influence, though the UN has reaffirmed its impartiality.Allegations of ethnic targeting Witnesses and the EHRC have accused Ethiopian authorities of arresting people in capital Addis Ababa based on ethnicity, using the wider powers granted by the current state of emergency.""We know for a fact Abiy is trying to ratchet up violence against not only Tigrayans but also others who are not willing to fight in his desperate cause,"" said Getachew of the arrests. Billene told CNN on Tuesday that she would need to get further details on reports of alleged arbitrary detentions in the capital, but that the purpose of the state of emergency was ""not to target any particular person based on the identity that they are aligned to.""Instead, the policy is designed to ""protect the Ethiopian people"" and ""to protect the residents of Addis Ababa"" who have been told they're going to come under siege, she said.  Ethiopian authorities are still holding at least nine UN staff members in police stations across Addis Ababa, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday, a day after announcing that 16 UN staff members and their dependents had been detained.""We're trying to get clarity, we're trying to get people out, and we're trying to get exact numbers in a place where often communications are challenging within the country,"" he said, adding that no official explanation had been given by the Ethiopian government as to why they were being held. Dozens of drivers hired by the UN and an aid organization to deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance to Tigray have also been detained, Dujarric said. ""A tragic part of this is that the trucks are full. The trucks need to get into Tigray.""State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that the US understood from reports that those arrested were Tigrayan, and that, if confirmed, the US would condemn them. ""Detention on the basis of ethnicity is completely unacceptable,"" he said.",2
274," (CNN)Ethiopia's government has used the country's flagship commercial airline to shuttle weapons to and from neighboring Eritrea during the civil war in Ethiopia's Tigray region, a CNN investigation has found.  Cargo documents and manifests seen by CNN, as well as eyewitness accounts and photographic evidence, confirm that arms were transported between Addis Ababa's international airport and airports in the Eritrean cities of Asmara and Massawa on board multiple Ethiopian Airlines planes in November 2020 during the first few weeks of the Tigray conflict.   It's the first time this weapons trade between the former foes has been documented during the war. Experts said the flights would constitute a violation of international aviation law, which forbids the smuggling of arms for military use on civil aircraft.   Atrocities committed during the conflict also appear to violate the terms of a trade program that provides lucrative access to the United States market and which Ethiopian Airlines has benefited greatly from.  Ethiopian Airlines is a state-owned economic powerhouse that generates billions of dollars a year carrying passengers to hubs across the African continent and all over the world, and it is also a member of the Star Alliance, a group of some of the world's top aviation companies. The airline has issued multiple denials about transporting weapons. On Thursday, Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement that it ""strongly refutes"" the findings of CNN's latest investigation. ""To the best of its knowledge and its records, it has not transported any war armament in any of its routes by any of its aircraft,"" the airline said, echoing previous denials.The statement said ""alleged pictures"" in CNN's report are not known to Ethiopian Airlines. It also focused on one entry in cargo documents that said ""food stuff and refill,"" saying that the goods were ""declared on the document as per IATA standards.""The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Military refills  Long-simmering tensions between Ethiopia's government and the ruling party in the Tigray region exploded on November 4, when Ethiopia accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front of attacking a federal army base. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, ordered a military offensive to oust the TPLF from power. Government forces and regional militias poured into Tigray, joined on the front lines by troops from Eritrea.  Thousands of people are estimated to have died in the conflict, which by many accounts bears the hallmarks of genocide and ethnic cleansing. While all sides have been accused of committing grave human rights abuses during Tigray's war, previous CNN investigations established that Eritrean soldiers have been behind some of the worst atrocities, including sexual violence and mass killings. Eritrea has denied wrongdoing by its soldiers and only admitted to having troops in Tigray this spring.  Documents obtained by CNN indicate that flights carrying weapons between Ethiopia and Eritrea began at least as early as a few days after the outset of the Tigray conflict.  On at least six occasions -- from November 9 to November 28 -- Ethiopian Airlines billed Ethiopia's ministry of defense tens of thousands of dollars for military items including guns and ammunition to be shipped to Eritrea, records seen by CNN show.  The documents, known as air waybills, detail the contents of each shipment. In one document, the ""nature and quantity of goods"" is listed as ""Military refill"" and ""Dry food stuff."" Other entries included the description ""Consolidated."" The records also had abbreviations and spelling mistakes such as ""AM"" for ammunition and ""RIFFLES"" for rifles, according to airline employees. They told CNN the spelling errors were introduced when the contents were manually entered by employees into the cargo database. Benno Baksteen, chairman of DEGAS, the Dutch Expert Group Aviation Safety, told CNN that these waybills were required for all commercial flights as the crew on board need to know the contents of the cargo to ensure they are transported safely. On November 9, five days after Abiy ordered a military offensive in Tigray, records show an Ethiopian Airlines flight transported guns and ammunitions from Addis Ababa to Asmara, Eritrea's capital.  An air waybill and a cargo manifest from that date show that Ethiopian Airlines charged Ethiopia $166,398.32 for about 2,643 pieces of ""DFS & RIFFLE WITH AM (sic)"" on that flight. DFS is a reference to ""dry food stuff,"" according to airline sources.   Another air waybill from a few days later, November 13, has the same shipper and consignee. The content of that shipment was ""military refill and dry food stuff,"" according to the document. The shipments came at a time of increased military activity; security sources in the region told CNN the Eritreans needed re-supply for the fight in Tigray. As planes went back and forth between the two countries, massacres of Tigrayans in the city of Axum and the village of Dengelat by Eritrean troops took place on November 19 and November 30 respectively.  Cargo documents show that the series of flights between Ethiopia and Eritrea continued until at least November 28, 2020. Some current and former Ethiopian Airlines employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions, said the flights continued past this date but that the majority of arms trips to Eritrea were in November.  Both cargo and passenger planes were used in the operation, though CNN has no evidence that commercial passengers were on any of the flights carrying weapons. Many of these flights do not appear on popular online flight tracking platforms such as Flightradar24. When they do, the destination in Eritrea is often not visible and the flight path vanishes once the plane crosses the border from Ethiopia.   The employees told CNN the staff could manually turn off the ADS-B signal on board to prevent the flights being publicly tracked.  The flights were often assigned the same flight numbers, primarily ET3312, ET3313 and ET3314, with 'ET' being the code for Ethiopian Airlines. All the planes mentioned in the cargo files seen by CNN are American-made Boeing aircraft. The airline has been in a long relationship with the US aviation giant.   A Boeing representative declined to comment. Ethiopian Airlines workers described witnessing other airline employees loading and unloading arms and military vehicles on flights directed to Asmara. A few even claimed they helped load the weapons on the planes themselves. All spoke of being ethnically profiled for being Tigrayan.  CNN has seen the Ethiopian Airlines' ID cards of these employees and confirmed their identities.  One former employee told CNN they were instructed at Addis Ababa's Bole International Airport to load guns and four military vehicles onto an Ethiopian Airlines cargo plane that was due to fly to Belgium but was sent instead to Eritrea.   ""The cars were Toyota pickups which have a stand for snipers,"" the employee said. ""I got a call from the managing director late at night informing me to handle the cargo. Soldiers came at 5 a.m. to start loading two big trucks loaded with weapons and the pickups.""   ""I had to stop a flight to Brussels, a 777 cargo plane, which was loaded with flowers, then we unloaded half of the perishable goods to make space for the armaments.""    The former employee warned soldiers that the vehicles were carrying far more gas than was allowed under international air transport rules, but said they were overruled after a direct call from an army commander.   ""He [the commander] said we are going to war and we need the fuel to be loaded,"" the employee said. ""Then I referred the issue to my manager and my manager took responsibility and allowed them to load it.""  The flight, loaded with both weapons and flowers, traveled to Eritrea, then returned to Addis before flying on to Brussels the following day, the employee said. CNN cross-referenced this testimony with Flightradar24 and found the record of an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft returning from the direction of Eritrea and flying to Brussels the next day, but could not independently verify it was the same flight referred to by the employee.  Days later, the employee said they were temporarily suspended from work. They believe they were suspended for being Tigrayan but also for the incident with the soldiers. The employee fled Ethiopia in March.  Ethiopian Airlines told CNN in its statement that no employees had been suspended or terminated due to their ethnic background.   It appears to be not the only long-distance international flight with unplanned stops. A flight from Addis Ababa to Shanghai on November 9, 2020, took a long detour via Eritrea according to the ADS-B signal that tracks the route on Flightradar24.  Several employees at the Addis Ababa airport said they saw multiple weapons flights leave for Eritrea each day at the outset of the conflict. They also spoke about flights carrying weapons from Eritrea back to Ethiopia. It's unclear why armaments were being transferred back to Ethiopia. One said they saw tanks and heavy artillery loaded onto planes coming to Addis Ababa, while small arms -- mortars, launchers -- were dispatched to Asmara. Employees told CNN they believed the smaller weaponry were being sent to Asmara to arm Eritrean troops.    All the employees said they were instructed by the airline to delete photos of the weapons from their phones. Not all of them did.   In June, photos circulated on social media platforms showing crates containing mortars on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight and the same crates being loaded on the plane in Massawa, Eritrea.    The company released a statement strongly denying the allegation that its planes were transporting weapons and claimed the photos were photoshopped.    However, CNN has corroborated the photos using visual analysis techniques, interviews and documentary evidence, dating them to a 777 Freighter cargo flight that flew from Ethiopia to Eritrea and back between November 8 and 9.  The images show a variety of mortars stacked up in the crates. Dan Kaszeta, a London based defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, identified the mortars as 832-DU 82mm mortar rounds, originally made in Russia but with many versions subsequently manufactured, including in Bulgaria.  CNN has contacted the Bulgarian government and reached out to Bulgarian arms producers but received no response. According to the EU's public database, Bulgaria sold weapons to Ethiopia as recently as 2020.  Another image features an employee wearing a uniform that matches with the Ethiopian Airlines uniform. The interior of the plane also fits the layout of an Ethiopian Airlines 777F cargo plane. The expiry date of the Emirates SkyCargo straps tightened around the crates -- November 2023 -- can be seen in the photos. Since these particular types of cargo straps -- TSO C172 -- have a lifespan of three years, they would have been used in November 2020 at the earliest. CNN has confirmed that these Emirates SkyCargo straps have been used on other Ethiopian Airlines flights. Emirates SkyCargo told CNN that its ""straps may be inadvertently mixed with those of other airlines by ground handlers, who are third-party contractors, and may be used to secure cargo transported on other aircraft.""CNN has learned that the cargo plane in question took off on November 8 from Addis Ababa empty before landing in Massawa, where local workers were tasked with manually loading it with a variety of weapons, including these mortars. A cargo manifest from that day, seen by CNN, confirms the flight was empty when it reached Massawa.   A screenshot from the Ethiopian Airlines internal database taken by an employee and sent to CNN reveals a flight on November 8 to Massawa that is hidden from flight tracking sites. The weapons were then dropped in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, before the aircraft returned to Addis Ababa on November 9.  'A lot of legal repercussions'  Several aviation experts CNN spoke to on these findings said Ethiopian Airlines appeared to be in violation of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly known as the Chicago Convention, which prohibits commercial carriers from transporting ""munitions of war or implements of war.""  Pablo Mendes de Leon, professor of air and space law at The Hague, told CNN there are several indications that these flights were commercial flights -- not military or state aircraft -- including ""that [the flights] carry a commercial flight number of Ethiopian Airlines in conjunction with the fact that an airway bill has been issued.""      ""I have now arrived at the conclusion that [these flights have] been operated by civil aircraft falling under the terms of the Chicago Convention,"" Mendes de Leon said, adding that CNN's findings ""have a lot of legal repercussions and conditions, all of which may not have been met.""  Ethiopia's status as a regional economic powerhouse is partly dependent on Ethiopian Airlines' dominance in cargo. The country and the airline have benefited from an American trade program that provides favorable access to the US market for countries that meet certain criteria.  This relationship matters for both countries: in 2017, US exports to Ethiopia consisted primarily of aircraft and aircraft components from Boeing, valued at more than $857 million.    But a clause in the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) stipulates that eligible nations must not engage in ""gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."" Previous CNN investigations found atrocities committed by the Ethiopian government and its allies bore the hallmarks of genocide and ethnic cleansing. In late August, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai warned Ethiopia's chief trade negotiator that ""the ongoing violations of internationally recognized human rights"" in Tigray ""could affect Ethiopia's future [AGOA] eligibility if unaddressed."" On Tuesday, a spokesperson told CNN that Tai's office would conduct its next review of eligibility for AGOA in 2022, ""based upon compliance with standards that include adherence to internationally recognized workers' rights, rule of law, and human rights."" After the review, Tai could ""possibly recommend that the President add or remove certain countries from AGOA beneficiary country status.""This story has been updated to include a statement from Emirates SkyCargo, remove an erroneous reference to a cargo strap manufacturer and correct the spelling of the Ethiopian city of Bahir Dar.

275," (CNN)Sudan has descended into crisis after the military dissolved the country's power-sharing government and declared a state of emergency on Monday.The move has crushed hopes for a peaceful transition of power following the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir in 2019.Here's what you need to know:What's going on in Sudan?Sudan had been ruled by an uneasy alliance between the military and civilian groups since 2019. But on Monday, the military effectively took control, dissolving the power-sharing Sovereign Council and transitional government, and temporarily detaining Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. Sudan's top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said that the agreement with civilian members of the country's transitional sovereign council ""became a conflict"" over the past two years, ""threatening peace and unity"" in Sudan. Several articles of the constitution have been suspended and state governors removed, Burhan also said.PM Hamdok and his wife, as well as multiple government ministers and officials, were detained on Monday, and later returned to their residence on Tuesday, according to a source with Sudan Prime Minister Office and a military source. It was not clear whether Hamdok and his wife are able to move freely after they returned to their home, or whether other government ministers and officials are also let go or still detained.However, key opposition leaders also were swept up Tuesday in a new wave of arrests, including the younger brother of Sudan's foreign minister, pro-democracy sources told CNN.Who is Burhan?Sudan's top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is behind the military takeover.Born in Sudan's River Nile state in 1960, Burhan served as inspector general of the Sudanese armed forces and was its third most senior general, Reuters reported. But he was largely unknown in public life before he became chief of the Sovereign Council, a hybrid civilian-military body set up to guide Sudan to democracy. As leader of the council, he served as head of state for the last two years.Burhan was supposed to relinquish control of the council to a civilian leader in the next few weeks. Instead, he dissolved the council, saying in a televised statement that he would hold elections in July 2023 and hand over to an ""independent and fair representative government"" then. On Tuesday, Burhan said the military had presented the deposed civilian government with options to evade a political deadlock, but they were rejected.How did the current troubles start?When Bashir was ousted in a 2019 coup, ending his brutal three-decade-long rule, Sudan's military leadership assumed control to oversee the transition of power, forming the Transitional Military Council. But the council was strongly opposed by a pro-democracy movement which called instead for civilian rule. After a weeks-long standoff, the two sides agreed to form a Sovereign Council that would govern ""for the next three years or a little longer.""Under the deal struck in July 2019, the military council would be in charge of the country's leadership for the first 21 months. A civilian administration would then rule the council over the following 18 months.But it has proved to be a shaky alliance. The triumphant mood that swept the nation after Bashir's removal has soured, with tensions between the two sides mounting as they fought to maintain control over the nation's future.Did the coup come as a surprise? Not entirely. Adam Hireika, an aide to Hamdok, told CNN the premier was aware of the army's plans and had been under pressure to dissolve the government.Hireika said he visited Hamdok on Sunday evening where he discussed the current state of affairs. He said Hamdok had just met with Burhan.On Monday, the Information Ministry said Hamdok had been under pressure to release a statement ""in support of the takeover."" Instead, it said, he called on pro-democracy protestors take to the streets in peaceful protest.Why is it happening?Tensions had been rising after some politicians, including Hamdok, pushed for a full transition to civilian rule by November 17, in keeping with the original transitional agreement.The situation escalated last month, when a military coup d'etat attributed to forces loyal to Bashir failed, resulting in most of the officers involved being arrested.In the weeks since, military leaders have been demanding reforms to the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition and the replacement of the cabinet. Civilian leaders accused them of a power grab.Throngs of Sudanese protesters took to the streets last Thursday, demanding that the 2019 transition deal be honored and calling for an elected government. There were also pro-military protests opposing the civilian government.How has the international community reacted?United Nations Secretary General António Guterres condemned the coup and called for the release of the prime minister and other officials, he said in a tweet Monday, adding that the UN would ""continue to stand"" with the people of Sudan.At a press briefing, the White House said the Biden administration was ""deeply alarmed"" by events unfolding in Sudan, while the United Kingdom called the coup an ""unacceptable betrayal of the Sudanese people.""The European Union has ""strongly condemned"" the coup and stressed the ""serious consequences"" for the EU's engagement with Sudan, including its financial support, unless the situation is reversed immediately.Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Sudan's Foreign Minister Mariam al-Sadiq called for further action from the international community. Al-Sadiq said that she expects ""genuine action"" from the UN security council on Sudan's military following the takeover. ""Some of my colleagues were already in prison and we didn't know about their whereabouts,"" he said.What does this mean for US aid?The United States had high hopes for Sudan's transition to democracy and, in recent weeks, has attempted to avert a potential military takeover. The US removed Sudan from its state sponsors of terror list last year and, in June, it supported a $50 billion debt relief package for the country. As tensions have escalated in recent weeks, the Biden administration has voiced its support for the civilian-led transition to democracy in Sudan, and emphasized any attempt by military actors to thwart it would have consequences on planned US assistance. Over the weekend, the US sent its top regional envoy, Jeffrey Feltman, to Khartoum to discuss the democratic transition with Prime Minister Hamdok, Gen. Burhan and Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, urging for ""all actors to recommit to working together"" to implement the agreement. Just after his visit, the Sudanese military launched its takeover.The White House on Monday condemned the coup and paused $700 million in emergency assistance to Sudan intended to support the democratic transition -- critical aid for a country grappling with a growing economic crisis. What do the protesters want? Thousands of protesters opposing the coup took to the streets of the capital, Khartoum, on Monday, some chanting: ""We are walking holding worry in our hearts and worry sleeps in people's chests."" They gathered in multiple locations.The number of protesters killed in Sudan now stand at 8 with more than 140 injured since Monday protests started against a military takeover, three sources at the Ministry of Health and Sudan Central Doctors Committee, which is aligned with the civil component of the now-dissolved Sovereign Council, told CNN. Videos on social media showed crowds of people making their way towards the military's General Command. Some could be seen removing razor wire that had been placed across a road amid reports of street closures in several parts of the city.  Supporters of civilian rule have also announced a program of civil disobedience and a strike in response to the military takeover, the Ministry of Information said on Facebook.  Where does this leave the democratic transition?The military takeover threatens to derail Sudan's path to democracy, just as the country had begun to resurface after decades of autocratic rule, global isolation and crippling economic sanctions. In just a few weeks, Sudanese people were poised to celebrate their first full civilian leadership in three decades. But now, the military has declared it will rule on its own, and it is unclear whether it will make good on its promise for a free election.Burhan said Tuesday that the transitional period will still focus on creating a civilian government and claimed that the Sudanese military will not be involved in politics. ""We only want to correct the path of the transitional phase,"" he said.Where is Omar al-Bashir?The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued arrest warrants in 2009 and 2010 for Bashir on charges of genocide and war crimes related to Sudan's military campaign in Darfur between 2003 and 2008.Earlier this year the government announced it would hand the former president over to the ICC, along with other officials wanted over the Darfur conflict.The former president is currently in prison in Sudan; he was sentenced to two years for corruption and illegitimate possession of foreign currency in 2019. He also faces another trial in Sudan over his role in the 1989 coup which brought him to power. ",2
276," (CNN)In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president. These power grabs threaten a reversal of the democratization process Africa has undergone in the past two decades and a return to the era of coups as the norm. According to one study, sub-Saharan Africa experienced 80 successful coups and 108 failed coup attempts between 1956 and 2001, an average of four a year. This figure halved in the period from then till 2019 as most African nations turned to democracy, only for it to once again be on the ascendance. Why?Different decade, same problemsIn the early postcolonial decades when coups were rampant, Africa's coup leaders virtually always offered the same reasons for toppling governments: corruption, mismanagement, poverty. The leader of Guinea's recent coup, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, echoed these justifications, citing ""poverty and endemic corruption"" as reasons for overthrowing 83 year old president Alpha Conde. The soldiers who led a coup in neighbouring Mali last year claimed ""theft"" and ""bad governance"" prompted their actions. Likewise, the Sudanese and Zimbabwean generals who toppled Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and Robert Mugabe in 2017 respectively, deployed similar arguments.  While well-worn, these justifications still resonate with many Africans today for the simple reason they continue to accurately depict the reality of their countries. Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening. The research network Afrobarometer conducted surveys  across 19 African countries which showed 6 in 10 respondents saying corruption is increasing in their country (the figure was 63% in Guinea) while 2 in 3 say their governments are doing a poor job fighting it. Furthermore, 72% believe ordinary citizens ""risk retaliation or other negative consequences"" if they report corruption to authorities, a sign Africans believe their public institutions are not just partakers in, but active defenders of, corrupt systems. When it comes to poverty, an already tragic situation has been worsened by the battering Africa's fragile economies took from the coronavirus pandemic.  One in three people are now unemployed in Nigeria, West Africa's largest economy. The same goes for South Africa, the most industrialized African nation. It is now estimated the number of extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa has crossed the 500 million mark, half the population. This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.  These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.  But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. ""The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action...  and I'm not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,"" he says.Threat to democratic gains  What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want.  Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure ""MPs reflect voters' views"" and to ""enable voters remove non-performing leaders.""  In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies. Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.  Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent, from Uganda's Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte d'Ivoire.  The African Union is rightly condemning Guinea's coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted. These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day. ""If the people are crushed by their elites, it is up to the army to give the people their freedom,"" said Guinea's new leader, quoting the former Ghanaian president Jerry Rawlings who himself led two coupsIt is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new. We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred. Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.This increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation. Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves. They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in today's African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike.

277," (CNN)Two of Africa's Covid experts are clearing out their desks and counting the hours as they prepare to take up new roles offered to them overseas.Dr. John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), has welcomed his September nomination to lead the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a position that, if confirmed by the US Senate, he would be the first African to hold.Earlier the same month, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, who currently heads the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was appointed to lead the World Health Organization (WHO) Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in the German capital Berlin, WHO said, with the Nigerian physician on course to assume his new position on November 1.Some experts assert that this coincidental turn of events underscores the health sector brain drain from Africa.""That's brain drain,"" said Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, a former president of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors.""They (Nkengasong and Ihekweazu) have seen better offers and they feel it's better to leave for greener pastures to further their careers,"" Okhuaihesuyi told CNN. ""Now is not the best time to leave,"" he added.Nkengasong is a decorated Cameroonian-born virologist, who has chaired the Africa CDC since its launch in 2017, and has played a critical role in Africa's coronavirus response, amplifying the need for ""rapid access to vaccines.""Nigeria's Ihekweazu, an epidemiologist and public health expert, is famed for strengthening his country's capacity to tackle infectious diseases and has helped it contain the third wave of Covid-19 infections with tracking and testing efforts.Ihekweazu's strides at the NCDC had been commended by WHO.Medical brain drain persistsThe emigration of African physicians has continued to rise. In 2015, over 13,000 emigrated to the US alone, representing a 27 percent increase over the course of the previous decade, one study found. Recent data is scarce, but a November 2020 report by the African Union (AU) said that despite the risks of frontline work during the pandemic -- migration to high-income countries remains attractive to health workers from Africa due to ""better working conditions, including renumeration and workload."" ""If not managed well, increased demand for health workers, especially in specialities like anaesthesiology, will leave considerable gaps in Africa's already weak health systems,"" the report said.Many high-income countries were relaxing visa and immigration requirements for health workers in order to meet that demand, the AU said. ""Without the right policies in place, tackling the brain drain from Africa will become an even more challenging endeavour, inevitably leading to an increase in global inequality and neglect of already inadequate health systems."" The medical brain drain already comes at a great cost for  Africa, which, according to pre-pandemic WHO figures, only has access to 3 percent of the world's health workers despite suffering ""more than 22 percent of the global burden of disease."" ""Nothing to worry about""Africa is fighting off new strains of the coronavirus, and vaccination against the disease has been slow in the continent, where only 60 million of its more than 1 billion people have received a full course of the vaccine.Nkengasong's imminent exit from the Africa CDC has fueled concerns about the sustainability of the institution's Covid-19 action plan.Nkengasong, however, told CNN there was nothing to worry about.""Africa CDC has a very strong leadership in place,"" he said. ""So, I am not at all worried. The organization is rock solid.""On his part, Nigeria's Ihekweazu told CNN he had built the NCDC to ""outlive any single leader.""""In the last five years, we have built structures, systems, and people at NCDC with the vision that these will outlive any single leader,"" he said. ""I am very proud of the work we have done and confident that the 500 members of staff who have led this journey will sustain this beyond my time as Director General,"" Ihekweazu added.Reacting to comments that his move to the WHO's $100 million Pandemic Hub worsens  Africa's medical brain drain, Ihekweazu argued: ""I think that my move to WHO strengthens Africa's position in the world!""According to WHO, the hub, which is funded by the German government, was established ""to better prepare and protect the world from global disease threats,"" and will play key roles in helping ""to detect new events with pandemic potential and to monitor disease control measures on a real-time basis.""Ihekweazu told CNN that beyond his work in Nigeria, he is"" strongly committed to seeing African countries grow from being just participants in the consumption of vaccines and other technologies to participants in the basic science and research that leads to them.""He added: ""I believe that my new role at the WHO Pandemic Hub provides an opportunity to contribute to this growth process for Nigeria and the African region -- working closely with other colleagues.""Other gains for AfricaMalawi's secretary for health, Dr. Charles Mwansambo, told CNN that Nkengasong and Ihekweazu's move to ""strategic positions"" will be beneficial to Africa.""We need to start looking at these movements positively because they are good for the continent. The more Africans are in strategic positions, the better Africa will be served,"" he said, adding that Nkengasong's new role at PEPFAR would be crucial to Africa's HIV/AIDS response.""Though Covid is here with us, there are other conditions like HIV that have been with us for some time. So, getting an African there [at PEPFAR] will make a whole difference to the fight against HIV/AIDS on the continent... PEPFAR has some great influence in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa, especially Malawi which is a major beneficiary. It's the right move for the continent,"" Mwansambo said.Described as the ""largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history,"" PEPFAR was established in 2003 as part of the US global AIDS response to prevent millions of HIV infections and nip the epidemic in the bud. More than $85 billion has been invested by the US government in tackling HIV/AIDS around the world.Nkengasong would potentially fill the leadership vacuum at PEPFAR, which has been without a leader for nearly two years.Steve Ahuka, an incident manager for the Democratic Republic of Congo's Covid-19 response, told CNN that he hopes Nkengasong and Ihekweazu's successors will be as passionate as their predecessors in the fight against infectious diseases.""Though we will prefer to have them [Nkengasong and Ihekweazu] during this moment when the African continent is facing Covid-19 crisis, the battle against infectious diseases is done as a team... I hope Nkengasong and Ihekweazu have built a strong team in Nigeria and the Africa CDC, and their successors will continue the work to fight the Covid crisis,"" Ahuka said.Dr. Githinji Gitahi, a member of the Africa CDC's governing board, told CNN that Nkengasong ""will be difficult to replace.""""Nkengasong has built a formidable reputation for the Africa CDC and attracted partners and resources that have enabled it to achieve its mandate of coordination of disease surveillance and response. He will be greatly missed,"" he said.Gitahi wants regional centers of the Africa CDC to be strengthened so that the power of the parent organization is devolved.However, he said it was important that Nkengasong and Ihekweazu were moving to institutions ""that have a huge impact on the health of African people and their health security.""A spokesman for Uganda's health ministry, Ainebyoona Emmanuel, told CNN Nkengasong and Ihekweazu's exit from the continent ""is not a brain drain, but rather African leaders advancing to global leaders.""",2
278,"Accra, Ghana  (CNN)A safe house was the only place Joe felt protected enough to meet.  Tucked away in a neighborhood of Accra, off Aflao Road, a group of Ghanaian gay activists use the house to gather in secret and provide shelter to LGBTQ people in need.    Sitting on the corner of a couch in the gloomy interior, Joe holds a small clutch in both hands and speaks with a quiet defiance.  ""I can't change the way I am. I can't change who I am,"" he says. ""This is natural, and it is how I feel. But we are dead. We are all now dead. We can't go out again and we can't mingle with our friends again.""  It wasn't supposed to be like this in Ghana.  For years, Ghanaian LGBTQ activists felt they had made progress. They witnessed a quiet tolerance, especially in larger cities, and believed that their rights would continue to evolve.  But within weeks, Ghana's parliament is set to debate a draft bill -- framed in the guise of ""family values"" -- which seeks to introduce some of the harshest anti-LGBTQ laws on the African continent.  The prospect of it passing is pushing the country's LGBTQ community into the shadows.  LGBTQ Ghanaians have been left asking how things got so bad, so quickly, and Western diplomats say they have been caught by surprise.  But what one Ghanaian activist calls a ""homophobe's dream bill"" has deep roots in Ghana's religious community. It also found key inspiration from a US ultra-conservative group with Russian ties.  Humiliated on camera  Joe's path to the safe house began in his hometown, several hours drive from the capital. CNN agreed to identify him only by his assumed first name, because he fears for his safety.One evening several months ago, Joe says he was accosted on the street by a group of men who accused him of approaching one of their male relatives. ""I was shaking when they took me to that room and they took out their cameras. I was shaking and I was crying,"" he told CNN.  He says the men took him to an abandoned construction site for interrogation. In a grainy video, seen by CNN, they bark at him in Fante dialect: ""Is it true that you told him that you like him?"" ""Yes,"" Joe replies meekly, shivering in the concrete room. Later in the clip, Joe is seen crouching on the ground as he is repeatedly kneed in the head by one of his attackers.  When videos of Joe's ordeal were shared on social media several months later, he says his father threw him out of the family home.  ""When I saw the video. I was like, it is better to kill myself, but I had nowhere to go,"" he says.  LGBTQ activists say what happened to Joe is part of a pattern of abuse seen in Ghana over several years. Video after video show Ghanaians -- mostly men perceived as being gay -- being harassed and beaten on camera, sometimes stripped naked by their assailants. Lesbian and trans Ghanaians are also targeted, say activists, but most attacks go unreported.  Although some are harassed and shamed publicly, these attitudes were not universal; activists speak of regular LGBTQ-friendly parties held in Accra being advertised openly on social media.A Human Rights Watch report from 2018 found that Ghana had a mixed record in its treatment of LGBTQ Ghanaians. Old sodomy laws dating back to 1960 remain on the statute books in Ghana -- as they do across much of Africa -- but they are rarely, if ever, enforced. This year, that could all change.   A door opens, then is shut  Multicolored balloons and rainbow umbrellas decorated Ghana's first LGBTQ support center, in Accra, for its grand opening in January. Diplomats from several European nations and Australia attended, and LGBTQ Ghanaians said they couldn't believe the progress Ghana had made.  The backlash was immediate. Traditional leaders, church groups, and lawmakers flooded social media, rushed to local TV stations, and used their pulpits to excoriate the center, blaming its existence on Western influence and claiming it was an attempt to ""recruit"" young Ghanaians.  Many of the critics are part of a loosely-configured group known as the National Coalition for Proper Human Sexual Rights and Family Values.  ""We knew that there would be opposition, but we didn't think it would be of this magnitude,"" says Alex Kofi Donkor, director of LGBT+ Rights Ghana, the group that opened the center. ""The whole country seemed to be talking about it."" The resulting public outcry led to a police raid, and the center was closed less than a month after it had opened.Soon afterward, plans for the draconian new anti-LGBTQ law began to emerge. The bill was introduced in parliament in early August.  The draft ""Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill"" -- a copy of which has been obtained by CNN -- would see LGBTQ Ghanaians face jail time, or be coerced into so-called ""conversion therapy"" -- a widely discredited practice debunked by much of the international medical and psychiatric communities.Under the bill, advocates of the LGBTQ community would face up to a decade in prison; public displays of same-sex affection or cross dressing could lead to a fine or jail time, and certain types of medical support would be made illegal.The new law would also make the distribution of material deemed pro-LGBTQ by news organization or websites illegal. It calls on Ghanaians to turn over those they suspect of being from the LGBTQ community. ""It is against our culture, it is against our norms, it is against our tradition,"" says Emmanuel Kwasi Bedzrah, one of the members of parliament (MPs) whose name is on the bill. ""We don't want things that are against our sensibility to be given priority in our society and therefore this will be a deterrent to anyone who supports them.""  Standing outside Ghana's imposing parliament complex as a bank of dark clouds threatens to break the intense heat, the MP says: ""In the beginning of this year we had a group of people in the guise of an NGO trying to lure people into their fold. We noticed that it [being a member of the LGBTQ community] is spreading like wildfire in the country."" ""We love them, we are asking them not to do it,"" Bedzrah says as the cloud breaks, rain battering the giant black star of Ghana's flag outside of the Speakers' office.  Just a short drive from parliament, we meet a prominent gay activist at Accra's Black Star Square, where an arch commemorating Ghana's independence celebrates ""Freedom and Justice."" Unlike the lawmakers CNN spoke to for this story, Danny Bediako is too afraid to use his real name -- or to speak in a public place.Bediako, who runs the NGO Rightify Ghana, denounced the claim that homosexuality is a Western import or that LGBTQ activists were out to recruit and convert straight Ghanaians.  ""The same people they claim to have brought homosexuality to Africa are the same people who told them to have this hate they are using against us,"" he says. ""There have always been queer Ghanaians.""    Bediako says the anti-LGBTQ ""family values"" coalition has long been a loud presence in Ghana, but that it was never organized or particularly strategic.  He believes that changed when a US group promoting those same ""family values"" organized a conference in Accra in late 2019 -- just before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.  ""The US right-wing people were here and after that there was a rush to push legislation,"" Bediako says.  The conference was hosted by the World Congress of Families, which Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ rights group, calls ""one of the most influential American organizations involved in the export of hate."" The genesis of the law  The 2019 conference was largely organized in response to proposals by the Ghanaian government to create a comprehensive sex education curriculum, to teach young people about the emotional, physical and social aspects of sexuality. This plan was later shelved.  But audio recordings, presentations, and action plans of the meeting, reviewed by CNN, show that much of the conference's time was focused on the supposed ""dangers"" of LGBTQ influence, labeling it as a grand left-wing conspiracy out to destroy ""family values.""  One of the highlights of the conference, for attendees, was the presence of US ultra-conservative organizer Brian Brown, the president of the World Congress of Families (WCF).  Brown made a name for himself pushing Californians to outlaw same-sex marriage at the ballot. He continues to lead the National Organization for Marriage and heads up a digital fundraising effort for right-wing Republican Party candidates in the US. The WCF has curious beginnings: It was founded in the late 1990s as a collaboration between US religious conservatives and right-wing Russians, after the fall of the Soviet Union.  But in recent years, in conferences from Hungary to Croatia, Tbilisi, Georgia; to Verona, Italy, the group has become increasingly influential in organizing anti-LGBTQ forces and inspiring policy initiatives, according to Neil Datta, secretary of the European Parliamentary Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Rights.  Datta recently authored extensive research on anti-LGBTQ groups in Europe that included data about the alleged funding of the WCF's activities. ""The World Congress of Family conferences are like an incubator for bad ideas,"" says Datta. ""Different religious extremists from different parts of the world meet and exchange ideas and then people take those ideas and expand on it at the national level.""  He says several pieces of legislation and petitions in Eastern Europe appear to have flowed from WCF meetings.  ""The fact that the WCF took place in Accra in 2019 and now we have something appearing as a draft bill is not surprising. This draft ""Family Values"" bill seems to be one more iteration of the homophobic initiatives emanating from their conferences,"" he says.                                                                                                                                                                At WCF's Accra conference, the delegates proposed the formation of legal teams to mount constitutional and legal challenges within six months to a year. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, their timeline wasn't far off.  But Brown insists that his organization provides inspiration, not instruction. ""In each of these countries people are saying 'enough is enough' with Western countries coming in and saying we are going to redefine the family,"" he told CNN from his office in Washington D.C. Brown says the WCF had nothing to do with writing the Ghanaian bill: ""You don't need to look for a bogeyman, it is going to come from the people themselves and there is a huge opportunity for stronger global ties."" That inspiration seems apparent when Ghanaians pushing the bill use strikingly similar talking points to Brown's organization, including a near obsession with the ""natural"" family as a way to propagate generational Christian conservative values.   ""Those who are promoting gays and lesbians are not going to have children at all, and within a short time nobody should be surprised that Muslims will become a majority in this country and declare it an Islamic state,"" Archbishop Philip Naameh, the president of the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference, told CNN. He welcomes the support of WCF.But some activists believe a crackdown on LGBTQ rights was waiting to happen with or without a nudge from US conservatives, because of growing discontent within the religious community in Ghana.  In a massive online prayer rally in March entitled: ""Homosexuality: a detestable sin to God,"" pastors at the millions-strong Pentecostal Church said it was a matter of ""national security"" to pass a law; they continue to push members of parliament to follow through with their plans.   The Pentecostal Church's leadership repeatedly refused CNN's requests for an interview.  The damage is already done Members of parliament and activists say the draft bill will be debated and likely voted on after Ghana's parliament reopens in late October. Based on CNN's reporting, it appears to have strong support -- even among more moderate MPs.   The bill may end up being watered down in the amendment process. It will also need to be signed by President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is likely to face harsh condemnation from Western donors if it comes into law.  The bill places Western nations in a difficult position. Already heavily criticized for supporting the opening of the LGBTQ center earlier this year, the European Union and Australian missions would not speak to CNN on the record. The US did not have a representative at the opening, but one of the Biden administration's first acts was to formally task its agencies with combating anti-LGBTQ legislation globally. A State Department spokesperson told CNN the US government was concerned with the increasing rhetoric and actions that threaten the LGBTQ community in Ghana. ""We are monitoring the situation closely,"" the State Department statement said. ""We urge national leaders in Ghana to uphold constitutional protections and to adhere to Ghana's international human rights obligations and commitments for all individuals.""  But for many activists, the damage is already done.In late May, more than 20 participants in an LGBTQ paralegal training session organized by One Love Sisters, Ghana and Key Watch Ghana were arrested for ""unlawful assembly"" in the country's southeastern Volta region.   One of those present, a 21-year-old intersex woman, who has asked CNN to identify her by the pseudonym Edem Amavor because she fears for her safety, told CNN she was physically and sexually assaulted by police in a horrifying ordeal.Intersex people have natural variations in reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male.""I was taken to a male cell,"" she recalls. ""The officers told the men in the cell to rape me since I insisted I was a female."" Volta regional police spokesman Sgt. Prince Dogbatse told CNN that: ""No such reports have come to the attention of the Command,"" but that they would investigate the matter.  Another of those detained was Eddy Oppong, also using a pseudonym because of safety concerns. He was among those detained and released after 22 days, after charges against the paralegal group were dropped in early August.""People are scared,"" says Danny Bediako. ""People are feeling insecure to even go into public spaces and hold meetings for their organizations. Some people have stopped their support entirely."" He says he is now trying to hold support groups online. Bediako says LGBTQ activists have submitted memoranda to parliament to lessen the blow from the proposed new law, and they are trying to speak to MPs to encourage them to weaken the bill's provisions, but he fears few politicians will be brave enough to engage with them in the current climate -- even if lives are at stake.  ""The people who suspect us are waiting for the bill to be passed so they can beat us up and hand us over to the police,"" he said.  He believes that the limited space that Ghanaians from the LGBTQ community had to be themselves may soon vanish and that the precipitous drop in rights seen in recent months could become a permanent feature.  Joe, the gay Ghanaian who was beaten and thrown out of his home, spent just a few days at the safe house in Accra before moving on. He says he wishes he hadn't been born in Ghana. And he has a message for the MPs and religious leaders fronting the bill: ""We are all human beings. Their sons and their daughters can be like me. They can face the same thing, like the way those guys did to me.""  ""I want to ask: 'If their daughters and their sons have been through this -- will they allow the law to take them to jail?' My answer to them is they should put a stop to it."" ",2
279," (CNN)In the bustling Ogere Market in Ogun State, Nigeria, the race is on to sell fresh produce early in the day. By noon, the sun is at its peak, and with temperatures soaring, food spoils fast. As the day wears on, food can sell at less than half of its original value, slashing profits for retailers and farmers. That's why Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu decided to take a fresh approach to food waste. He's the founder of ColdHubs, which provides solar-powered food storage units designed for markets and farms. The 39-year-old has won countless awards for the initiative and has just been announced as the joint winner of the $1.5 million AYuTe Africa Challenge, for promising young innovators who are using technology to reimagine food production on the continent. Officially launched in 2015, ColdHubs now has 54 units in 22 states across Nigeria. More than 5,250 smallholder farmers, retailers, and wholesalers use its cold rooms and in 2020, the company stored 40,000 tons of food, reducing waste and increasing farmers' profits.  ""This is food meant for human consumption that we typically lose along the supply chain, either during harvesting, transportation, or distribution,"" says Ikegwuonu. ""The mission really is to reduce food spoilage due to lack of cold food storage at key points along the food supply chain."" Tackling a food waste crisisNigeria is ranked 100 out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Index. Over 88 million people in the country face food insecurity and 12% are undernourished. The problem isn't a lack of food, though: it's an excess of waste. An alarming 40% of the food Nigeria produces every year is lost before it even reaches consumers. That's equal to 31% of its total land use, according to the World Bank, and accounts for 5% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Ikegwuonu's ColdHubs are 10-foot-square cold storage units which keep produce fresh for up to 21 days. Conventional cold storage units of this size would be powered by diesel generators and require 20 to 30 liters of diesel every day, says Ikegwuonu -- but by using solar panels instead, he says that across all its units, the company prevents over 1 million kilograms of CO2 entering the atmosphere each year, while powering the units 24/7. According to the UN, food waste accounts for up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so finding solutions to reduce waste could be vital in the fight against climate change. Storing a crate of produce in the ColdHub costs around 25 cents per day, and has helped farmers and retailers double their monthly earnings, says Ikegwuonu: ""This has been achieved by selling produce that was previously thrown away, sold off at the right price."" Scaling upLooking to the future, Ikegwuonu says ColdHubs is also developing technology to freeze produce, for fishing communities in the Niger Delta. ""Most of the coastal communities don't have access to energy at all,"" he says, adding that these freezer storage units would also have the capacity to produce ice blocks. Ikegwuonu also wants to extend his social impact by creating gender parity and jobs in a country where around 35% of all employment is in agriculture, and 90% of rural livelihoods depend on it.""We have been able to create about 66 new jobs for women,"" he says. ""Many of these women have become empowered and change agents in their households and communities.""Ikegwuonu says his current focus is on expanding the business further in Nigeria -- but in the next decade, he has his sights set on other countries struggling with similar food waste problems. ""The big dream for us is to solve the problem of food spoilage in Nigeria, and expand our technology and service to other African countries that have these challenges,"" he says. ",2

281," (CNN)Fighting against climate change is often a matter of who controls the territory. In the indigenous reservation of Tacueyó in Colombia's southwestern department of Cauca, that is the role of the indigenous guards, a voluntary, unarmed organization that controls access to the community and administers local justice in place of the regular police.Armed only with sticks and machetes, these guards -- called kiwe thegnas in the local Nasa Yuwe language -- confront guerrillas and paramilitary groups who try to penetrate the community of Nasa indigenous people, who have been living across those mountains since before the Spanish colony. The guerrillas are now mostly involved in the drug trade and in Tacueyó they control the cultivation of illegal crops such as marijuana and coca, the raw material behind cocaine. The guerrillas are former left-wing fighters who rejected the landmark peace agreement the government and the now-demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) signed in 2016.The clash between the indigenous guards and the guerrillas here concerns pristine water sources: a mountain range overseeing Tacueyó rises at over 10,000 feet above sea level and the water sources in the top of the mountains feed creeks and rivers down the valley and from then on to the major rivers of Colombia.In a forest of frailejones, mountain sunflowers 6 feet tall that capture water vapor from clouds and release it to the ground creating water springs, Nora Taquinas, one of the leaders of the Nasa community, oversees the kiwe thegnas on patrol. ""If there was no more water here, there would be no water all across Colombia, the whole country would become a desert,"" she told CNN pointing at the local vegetation and surrounding streams.They are trying to preserve this space as a natural sanctuary of more than 350 hectares of wild terrain -- but for drug trafficking organizations, the same mountain range is a strategic location to control, a valuable outpost to provide shelter in their fight against the state. And the clash between the two is turning deadly.The threat of deathProtecting the environment is a dangerous job in Colombia. According to the international NGO Global Witness, Colombia was the world's most dangerous country for environmental activists last year. And of 290 environmental murders identified by Global Witness over the last decade in Colombia, 117 were indigenous.In Tacueyó, the scars of this struggle are visible to everyone who's entering town: a large signboard memorializes an indigenous leader, Cristina Bautista, and four kiwes who were murdered in their car on October 29, 2019, in an ambush on the main road. Authorities and eyewitnesses who spoke with CNN blamed the attack on the local guerrilla group Dagoberto Ramos and in June 2020, Colombian army units claimed to have captured the alleged guerrilla fighter behind the assassination.Taquinas, a single mother of two in her early 30s, survived the 2019 attack. ""I was just there, behind that turn of the road,"" she told CNN when visiting the place where her fellow guards were ambushed and shot at. ""I crawled behind the car's engine, and that stopped the bullets.""   She has since replaced Bautista as one of the most prominent leaders of the community. But with great responsibility also came greater risk: She has received threats from different criminal organizations, and in 2018 her name in 2018 was added to a list of leaders with a bounty on her head by one of the largest paramilitary groups in Colombia. Criminal organizations often publish such lists as a way to exert control over a territory, and to target the most vocal opponents to their actions. Bautista, Nora's leader who was assassinated in 2019, was also threatened. Taquinas shrugs at the threats. ""Of course, sometimes fear pushes you away from the struggle. But when that happens, you feel alone, abandoned, and then you look at the fight that other people have begun, people that have been murdered, and their murder has become inspiration for younger generations to rise, so you join and fight up again,"" she told CNN. Her environmental activism mixes with social issues in her community. Taquinas oversees projects of sustainable development of water sources like a trout farm to sustain the local economy and create jobs to prevent more people join the guerrilla or the coca crops.Projects to develop Tacueyó as a sustainable tourism destination have also been launched. This puts her even further in collision with the guerrillas, who don't control Tacueyó but whose presence is felt every day. Carmenza Cuchillo and Juan Peteche, who administer the trout farm on behalf of the community, both told CNN they had been approached by guerrillas several times to demand the payment of a ""protection fee"" for the farm. ""The presence of these groups has been growing steadily since 2018, now there are several of them. They are not ideological, all they care is the money; my predecessor left the job because of the threats, I'm still fine, but there's definitely more fear,"" Peteche told CNN. Several of the young guards who work with Taquinas told CNN they have also been approached for recruitment.What the government is doing about itIn recent months, the Colombian government has come under fire for the rising levels of violence in the countryside. More than 88 massacres have been reported by human rights NGOs in the year so far, defined in Colombia as the death of three or more unarmed people in an attack. Cauca, the department where Taquinas lives, is among the most affected of all Colombia by such attacks due to the presence of criminal armed groups and the production of illicit drugs. President Ivan Duque recently defended his administration's security record, pointing out that homicides and kidnappings are at the lowest rate in the last 50 years across the nation. Still, critics and analysts are urging the government to do more to increase security in rural areas such as Cauca, where narcotics production is found and massacres are more common.The United States is starting to pay attention to the issue: During a recent visit to Bogota, US Secretary of State Blinken urged the Duque administration ""to increase and strengthen the presence of the state in rural areas."" In October, Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern visited Cauca specifically to meet with social and environmental leaders facing violent threats.And while Duque's administration is vocal in its pledges to fight climate change, much more could be done to protect the environment by increasing government protection and surveillance in areas under threat like Tacueyó.  ""Protecting activists is almost a shortcut to climate action,"" says Louis Wilson of Global Witness. ""If you can uphold the rights of indigenous activists, if you can uphold the rights of land activists, of traditional communities; then they will do the job for us.""""These people are fighting the climate crisis already because it is in their immediate interests, often their livelihoods or their survival is on the line,"" she adds.Because of the threats she received, Taquinas is already under protection by the Colombian state, who provide her with an armored car and two minders when she leaves home. But the rest of her community is left for themselves, either to face criminals with no protection, or to join them. Taquina's latest project is a school to train the next generation of the kiwe thengas, hosted in a farmhouse on the road to the mountains. There she draws big plans for the reservation on a white board, urging her team to continue the struggle. Twenty hectares have already been rewilded, but 350 more remain. Of 37 water sources in the reservation, just 11 are monitored and protected.""I'm fine if my time on this earth is cut short,"" she told CNN with a smile, ""but I want to be sure there's someone to take up the fight.""",2
282," (CNN)A sidewalk collapsed during Christmas festivities in the southeastern city of Joinville in Brazil on Monday, injuring 33 people, according to authorities. People fell into the Cachoeira River when a sidewalk on Avenida Beira Rio collapsed during the inaugural Christmas presentation and the ceremony had to be interrupted for 40 minutes, the Joinville City Council said in a statement. Twenty-one adults and 12 children were sent to local hospitals but none had serous injuries, authorities said. The event later resumed, and the city's mayor, Adriano Silva, thanked emergency responders in his speech. ""We are grateful for not having anyone in serious condition and also for the emergency care that was provided to all the victims,"" the mayor said. A team from the Department of Urban Infrastructure and Civil Defense is continuing an inspection of the site's structure. Silva called a meeting for early Tuesday morning with managers from various city infrastructure departments to determine the next steps of action after the incident. ",2
283," (CNN)Canada is ending its pandemic-era policy of turning back asylum-seekers trying to cross into the country between ports of entry, according to a revised policy document released on Sunday.Canada turned at least 544 would-be refugees back to the Unites States between March 2020 and mid-October. The government did not immediately respond to questions regarding why it was ending the policy now and what if any quarantine rules would apply to asylum-seekers who are not vaccinated.Canada had said the measure was necessary given health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic. But refugee advocates argued attempts to claim asylum should not be considered ""discretionary travel"" and pointed to class exemptions Canada made during the pandemic for professional athletes, among others.""It's a relief to see the measures for refugees align more with our international obligations, and I think it's been clear all along that public health and refugee protection could coexist,"" said Maureen Silcoff, a refugee lawyer and past president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, which took the government to court over the policy.Silcoff said it did not make sense to allow tourists entry, as Canada has begun to do, while barring people seeking protection.An unknown number of asylum-seekers turned back were taken into indefinite U.S. immigration detention and at least two were deported, refugee lawyers working on their cases say.Exemptions have been available since the policy began, and in August Canada began allowing more turned-back asylum-seekers to return and file refugee claims as part of what it called a ""managed approach to reopening the border.""But advocates said this option was only open to those aware of it or who had legal counsel familiar with Canada's shifting system. The government defended the policy in court last month.Canada has a Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. under which asylum-seekers trying to cross at official ports of entry are turned back. The agreement, challenged twice, was upheld most recently this past spring and may go to Canada's Supreme Court.",2
284," (CNN)The race to replace Chilean President Sebastián Piñera is now down to two candidates after a general election was held on Sunday. José Antonio Kast, a candidate of the hard right, garnered 28 percent of the vote during Sunday's election in Chile, missing the necessary 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff. Kast, whose recent surge in popularity has surprised critics, has sometimes been compared to former US President Donald Trump and Brazil's current President Jair Bolsonaro.He will face 35-year-old Gabriel Boric, a leftist candidate and former student leader, who came in second with 25 percent of the vote. Representing polar opposites of Chile's presidential race, Boric and Kast now head to a runoff vote on December 19.This election comes two years after massive protests and riots shook the country in October 2019, with protesters demanding better pensions, better education, and the end of an economic system that they said favors the elite. The unrest led now-outgoing President Sebastián Piñera to agree to a plebiscite about the need to change the constitution inherited from the dictatorship -- a year later, Chileans overwhelmingly voted to draft a new constitution. But Chile still hasn't regained the stability for which it was once known. It has been hard-hit economically by the pandemic, and brutal clashes between protesters and security forces continue weekly in Santiago. Considering the recent past, Boric was widely perceived as the presidential candidate who better represented the country's social movement. He is a supporter of abortion rights, a welfare state model, and leads a broad coalition that includes Chile's Communist Party.But a powerful current of support for Kast, seen by some voters to represent stability and security, has upended predictions about the race. Kast emphasized rule of law, private property, a free market economy, and has even proposed building a three-meter ditch at strategic points of Chile's northern border to stop the flow of migrants from other countries. In an address to the nation Sunday, outgoing President Piñera congratulated both candidates.",2
285," (CNN)Two missionaries kidnapped in Haiti over a month ago have been released, according to a statement by the US-based Christian Aid Ministries. ""We have learned that two of the hostages in Haiti were released. We praise God for this! Only limited information can be provided, but we are able to report that the two hostages who were released are safe, in good spirits, and being cared for,"" the organization said Sunday.""While we rejoice at this release, our hearts are with the fifteen people who are still being held,"" the statement also said. The group of 16 Americans and one Canadian were kidnapped by the Haitian gang 400 Mawozo while traveling by car northeast of capital city Port-au-Prince on October 16. They include an infant, a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old, as well as two young teenagers. All hail from Amish, Mennonite and other conservative Anabaptist communities across six US states and Ontario. Authorities in the US and Haiti have not publicly commented on whether any of the hostages were released. Haitian police, the US Embassy in Haiti, the Justice Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister's Office, and the US State Department did not respond immediately to requests for comment.US and Haitian authorities, as well as the aid organization, have largely kept quiet about negotiations to release the hostages. Their captors had demanded $1 million per hostage, Haitian Justice and Interior Minister Liszt Quitel previously told CNN. Kidnappings for ransom in Haiti are widespread and often indiscriminate, targeting rich and poor, young and old. Rising crime has accompanied the country's political instability, with kidnappings spiking in the months after the July assassination of President Jovenel Moise, according to local human rights organization CARDH. The 400 Mawozo group is particularly notorious for group kidnappings. ""Has a month ever been this long? We think back to the first few days when our hopes were pinned on a quick response and a timely release, and our hearts cry, 'Lord, how much longer must this continue?'"" wrote the unnamed mother of one of the hostages in an earlier statement by Christian Aid Ministries, released November 19.",2
286," (CNN)Mexican authorities have reported finding some 600 migrants on Friday hidden in two trailers traveling through the state of Veracruz, according to the country's National Migration Institute (INM).In a statement, the migration agency said that they discovered 145 women and 455 men in closed box cars that were heading north towards the US border.A substantial majority of the migrants -- around 400 people -- come from neighboring Guatemala, while significant numbers also come from Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh.Twelve countries in total are represented in the migrants' profiles, with El Salvador, Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Ghana, India and Cameroon making up the remainder.The INM said they had started processing the people and would inform child protection agencies in the cases of unaccompanied minors and families, and will then decide whether to send them back to their home countries or give them the opportunity to remain in Mexico through a regularization procedure.In July, US Customs and Border Protection apprehended 212,672 people trying to cross the border between Mexico and the United States -- the highest number of arrests at the border in two decades.Between October 2020 and June 2021, more than 1 million migrants were arrested at the border. The crisis has prompted the US to run radio ads in Central America to try to deter people from migration.In the 2021 fiscal year, there were 557 deaths registered by US Border Patrol -- the highest number since records began and a significant increase from 254 deaths in 2020.Migration is very common from Central American countries like Honduras, where storms, violence, corruption, food insecurity, and a lack of economic opportunity have left many with no other choice.Elsewhere in Latin America, a crackdown on immigration policies accompanied by an exodus of Venezuelans and large numbers of Haitians moving through the continent have led to a migrant crisis in the region.In mid-2020, international migrants represented 2.6% of South America's whole population, a significant increase from the less than 1% registered in 2015, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).",2
287," (CNN)""This is the first time I will vote for a right-wing candidate. I consider myself a leftist, but today I am 100% sure I will go for José Antonio Kast,"" said Rodrigo Álvarez, a 48-old sociologist and public administrator, referring to Chile's far right presidential candidate, a long-time conservative politician and defender of former dictator Augusto Pinochet's regime. ""I want Chile to get back in order, the migrant crisis is out of control, we need more economic stability, and to stop the violence we´re still seeing two years after the social uprising. The only candidate who clearly says he will straighten things up is him,"" he adds. This Sunday, Chileans will head to the polls to elect their new president. Voters will pick one out of seven candidates; if none of them reaches the absolute majority there would be a runoff in December to choose between the top two runners. This election comes two years after massive protests and riots shook the country in October 2019, with protesters demanding better pensions, better education, and the end of an economic system that they said favors the elite. The unrest led now-outgoing President Sebastián Piñera to agree to a plebiscite about the need to change the constitution inherited from the dictatorship -- a year later, Chileans overwhelmingly voted to draft a new constitution. But Chile still hasn't regained the stability for which it was once known. Brutal clashes between protesters and security forces continue weekly in Santiago. Violence has also stricken parts of the country's south, where the government says drug traffickers took advantage of the state´s conflict with Indigenous communities to gain control. Like many countries, Chile's economy also slowed during the pandemic, prompting Congress to approve successive withdrawals from private pension funds. The pension system is a legacy from the military regime and credited by many businesses and economists as the foundation of the country´s strong capital markets; others, however, define the private pension system as a symbol of inequality. The turmoil has had a negative impact on the financial system and increasing inflation. Considering the 2019 political upheaval, Gabriel Boric, a 35-year-old leftist congressman and former student leader has been widely perceived as the presidential candidate who better represents the country's social movement. He runs for a broad coalition that champions a welfare state model and that includes the Communist Party. In the past few weeks, however, the situation has changed, reflecting increasing political polarization in Chile. Many Chileans are moving to support Kast -- a staunch defender of private property, who wants to reduce the size of the state, lower corporate taxes and focalize social policies -- allowing him to register an unexpected spike in the polls. Kast's surging popularity comes as something of a surprise after he opposed the creation of a new constitution and the election of a constituent assembly in May favored a left-leaning majority. But experts say it's part of a new trend in politics across the world: the expression of a frustrated middle class, distrustful of traditional parties and institutions, looking for more stability. ""I see this as part of the global penetration of a populist speech similar to Jair Bolsonaro´s in Brazil and Donald Trump´s in the USA,"" says Cristóbal Bellolio, a doctor in Political Philosophy and assistant professor at the Universidad Adolfo Ibañez in Santiago. ""They have an anti-globalist message and promote the exaltation of patriotic values that seem threatened by the left´s drive to drastically change everything. We are seeing a Chilean interpretation of the Make America Great Again,"" he adds.A 'new right' for ChileJosé Antonio Kast, a 55-year-old lawyer and former congressman, was a member of the Unión Democrática Independiente (UDI), Chile's most conservative party, before deciding to run independently in the 2017 presidential election. Less than 8% of the voters supported him, but he created his own party a year later and decided to try again. A fervent Catholic and father of nine, he comes from a family of entrepreneurs of German descent. One of his brothers held several ministerial positions during Pinochet's infamous regime. In the introduction to his political platform, Kast presents himself as the potential leader of a ""new right"" centered on three pillars: freedom, the defense of law and order, and the strength of family. Kast's proposals include a tax cut for companies, building barriers in the north of Chile to prevent migrants from entering illegally, abolishing abortion, and reinforcing the police, among others. He has also criticized the United Nations and wishes to limit Chile´s involvement in it. ""It´s true that he is part of a nationalist populist right that has been surging in other countries, but in addition to that he inherited the more extreme positions of his former party,"" says Robert Funk, a professor of political science at the Universidad de Chile and associate researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The lack of attractive candidates at the center of the political spectrum, the economic downturn, anticommunist feelings, and the government's weakening due to social unrest, experts say, explain Kast´s rapid surge.  Catalina Justiniano, a 43-year-old independent graphic designer and a mother of three, told CNN that she identifies with moderate right politics. She was planning to vote for Sebastián Sichel, the independent candidate who represents the Center Right. But then, she watched the television debates. ""I changed my mind. I felt Sichel was softening up, not answering questions clearly and I lost my trust in him. Kast was the candidate who had a clear stance on issues that matter and called things by their names,"" she says. Justiniano says that the October 2019 social uprise and the pandemic deeply affected her family. She lost a large part of her income and felt insecure because of the violence of the riots. Now, she wants to live in peace. ""I don't want anyone to give me money. I want to be able to earn my wage. I want to go out to work without worrying about taking public transportation"", she says. Justiniano's position summarizes the general feeling of some center-leaning voters who've been disillusioned with the candidates on offer. Experts say that Sichel didn't manage to keep the momentum he initially gained, and the center left contender, Yasna Provoste, a member of the traditional Christian Democratic party and the only female candidate, joined the race later in and failed to fully connect with her target electorate. Moving away from the centerChileans don't think in terms of left or right politics as much as in terms of a cleavage between chaos and order, according to Kenneth Bunker, a political scientist and the director of Tresquintos.cl, a digital platform of political analysis. ""The chaos doesn't only mean violence. It is also the disarray that some of the economic measures taken after the uprising of October 2019 have provoked. Prices have raised and the inflation is at 6%,"" he tells CNN. A sector of Chileans also feels disenchanted with the social movement and the constitutional process. According to Cristóbal Bellolio, motivated by the idea of a more equal country, many felt they had to accept the turbulence, as a cost for decisive political agreements that would bring peace and prosperity. Now, they wonder if it was worth it.  Some feel frustrated not to see their lives change after all that, others worry that the Constituent Assembly is leaning too far left. They see Kast as a possible counterweight.  Justiniano, for example, does not support Kast's more socially conservative policies, but believes Chile's Congress won't allow him to go through with them.  The demand for reassurance is strong enough for part of the population to trade once-cherished values for the idea of order and economic growth, experts say. Álvarez is one of those people. He belongs to the LGTBQ+ community and knows that Kast is against same-sex marriage. But he says he is ready to sacrifice that kind of freedom in exchange for stronger leadership and more certainty about what comes forward. ""I only agree with 70% of what Kast proposes, because I believe public policies must be for everyone. I know he is conservative and that we need to open up to the world, but I still believe he is the best option to bring economic development,"" he says. Preparing for uncertaintyThe final stretch of the race will be decisive, but a 15-day polling blackout before election day makes it difficult to anticipate the outcome of such a volatile electoral process. ""I believe Boric and Kast will be in the December runoff, but the political cycle goes too fast to define how much support each one of them will gather. They still can make mistakes that would affect their campaign,"" says Bunker.Whatever the result of Chile's presidential election, experts say, instability is likely to prevail. ""Whoever wins will have to negotiate with a fragmented Congress and it won't be easy to reach majorities"" says Robert Funk.  ""And neither platform is very elaborate. We don´t know how Boric will fund the policies he proposes, nor do we know the reaction Kast´s election could provoke in the streets. Unfortunately, this presidential election won´t reduce uncertainty"".",2
288," (CNN)A gang of six people accused of stealing horses for slaughter and selling the meat to restaurants disguised as beef has been arrested in southern Brazil, according to officials.A statement from the Public Ministry of Rio Grande do Sul (MPRS) on Thursday said the gang distributed more than 800 kilograms (1,763 pounds) of hidden horse meat per week to restaurants in the Caxias do Sul region. Up to 60% of restaurants in the area with beef on the menu had unwittingly bought horse meat from the gang disguised in steaks and hamburgers, public health officials said.Inspectors also discovered other forms of spoiled meat -- including rotting pork, turkey and leftover food from pig-feeding establishments -- were mixed inside the hamburgers, according to the statement. Officials said an investigation was launched two months ago after the local Agricultural Defense Inspectorate raised the alarm. Forensic tests carried out in restaurants selling hamburgers in Caxias do Sul confirmed the presence of horse DNA in the food, according to prosecutor Alcindo Bastos, who coordinated the operation.  The six people arrested are also accused of running an illegal abattoir with poor hygiene, insanitary conditions and without the authorization to process or sell any kind of meat. Judge Maria Cristina Rech remanded the six into preventative detention pending trial because the gang represented a serious threat to public health, according to MPRS.The case echoes a 2013 food scandal, in which authorities across Europe discovered widespread use of horse meat in products labeled as beef.Many meat eaters in the United Kingdom -- where horse meat is generally considered taboo -- were revolted by the revelations. A further discovery that year of pig DNA in beef products was of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid eating pork.",2
289," (CNN)A flotilla of motorboats, canoes, dinghies and jet-skis helmed by farmers raced to move dozens of trapped cows from frigid waters as floods hit the Canadian province of British Columbia.After a month's worth of rain in two days, the downpours triggered widespread flooding. Mudslides hit cities and towns across the province.Among the worst-affected areas was Abbotsford, one of the largest cities in the province by land size, with approximately half of it farms.Farmers and residents scrambled to save cattle as the water quickly rose above the animals' heads, even deploying a hovercraft. They risked their own lives to save the animals with the town under an evacuation order over fears that a water pumping station could fail and flood the area.Dozens of people used halters and small motorboats to coax frightened cattle to swim to safety and then loaded them onto larger trailers.""This is a disaster,"" said Abbotsford's Mayor Henry Braun, as he watched the desperate effort to save the cows.""When I see calves that are underwater and they throw them in the boats to save them, on the one hand it breaks my heart,"" he said. ""On the other hand, I'm just so impressed with our farming community coming together to help each other.""Many of the farms are in the low-lying Sumas Prairie, created by the draining of a lake nearly a century ago, and which was heavily flooded when the Sumas River breached its banks in the night.The floods trapped hundreds of motorists and cut off access to Canada's biggest port and all of Metro Vancouver's highway links to the rest of the country.",2

291,"Havana, Cuba (CNN)Cuban activists said they were forcibly trapped inside their homes on Monday, as the government clamped down on plans for opposition protests on the island. Protests are permitted under the Cuban constitution. However, the government had vowed not to allow Monday's planned demonstrations -- intended to call for greater political freedoms -- claiming they were a pretext to stir up trouble on the communist-run island, and that they'd been secretly organized by Cuban exiles and the US. The city of Havana saw a heavy police presence on Monday morning as authorities prepared to face potential protesters. Ultimately, streets remained quiet, however -- evidence of the chilling effects of the government's warnings. According to the Havana-based independent human rights organization Cubalex, Cuban police arrested 11 people, while 50 others were ""besieged"" inside their homes to forestall any public gathering.On Monday, Cuban activist Saily Gonzalez Velazquez said in a video broadcast live on Facebook that government supporters were blocking her house in Santa Clara to prevent her from attending the protests. ""At 5:30 in the morning people called by the Cuban government arrived in my neighborhood. I know they were called by the Cuban government because of the signs they were carrying,"" she told CNN, adding, ""They played music and when I got out of my house, they started yelling at me and my family."" The activist also alleged that those outside her home were giving her death threats. In the videos, a group of people could be seen outside her house holding signs and yelling, and chants of ""traitor"" can be heard from the crowd. The crowd can be seen holding signs that read ""Nothing can defeat us"" and ""Fatherland or Death."" Cuban activist, journalist and Washington Post columnist Abraham Jimenez Enoa also tweeted Monday saying he was ""under siege by plainclothes police and agents."" He tweeted, ""Neighbors are telling me that today's operation is larger than yesterday's. I cannot see it from my balcony because there's a tree blocking the view. I only see his feet. Are they so afraid of journalism that will go out and tell the truth? "" According to Cubalex, among the arrested on Monday were Cuban citizen Agustin Figueroa Galindo, who often writes for the opposition blog ""Primavera Digital en Cuba,"" and Berta Soler Fernández, leader of ""Damas de Blanco,"" an organization that advocates for the release of political prisoners on the island.Cuban officials had been on edge, fearing the spontaneous island-wide protests that rocked Cuba in January and led to over 1,000 arrests, according to activist groups.  But on Monday afternoon, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla declared Cuba was ""tranquil"" and that ""outside of Cuba they created expectations that were not met."" Over the weekend, Cuban government supporters also blockaded activist and playwright Yunior Garcia Aguilera's apartment in Havana in what appeared to be a move to preempt the demonstration. Garcia Aguilera is the event's highest-profile organizer. A government supporter who lives in Garcia Aguilera's neighborhood told CNN he was proud to have confined the activist to his home.  American officials have threatened further sanctions against Cuba if the protestors are arrested by police. ",2
292," (CNN)Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso has called a ""crisis cabinet"" after yet another outbreak of brutal prison violence left at least 68 people dead on Saturday, according to statement from the president's office.The move came after the Ecuadorian prosecutor's office asked the government to take ""urgent measures"" to address the situation, according to a post on the agency's official Twitter account. Prosecutors said at least 68 prisoners were killed and another 25 wounded during Saturday's clashes at the Litoral Penitentiary, one of Ecuador's largest prisons in the coastal city of Guayaquil.Hundreds of prisoners have died in large-scale riots and gang violence in Ecuadorian prisons over the past year. The same facility, the Litoral Penitentiary, saw 118 people killed in September during clashes that involved automatic weapons and even grenades.So far, 34 bodies have been identified since the Saturday bloodshed. They will be delivered to families in the following hours. ""The Human Rights Secretariat will deliver the coffins to the families in the next few hours while criminology continues to work on the identification of the other deceased,"" the Ecuadorian government said in a statement.The government is also offering psychological assistance for victims' families, the statement added. Ecuadorian police began activating security protocols Friday night after reports of gunshots and possible confrontations between inmates at the prison, according to Guayas Governor Pablo Arosemena in an announcement posted to the official Facebook page of the Guayas Province government.The deadly clashes appear to be an instance of gang violence, according to the governor, who said inmates ""not only used weapons and detonations, but they tried to suffocate [other prisoners], burned mattresses, and more.""Ecuador's prison system has been under a state of emergency since September's deadly clashes. More than 300 inmates have been killed in prison violence this year, according to figures from Ecuador's prison service SNAI.",2
293," (CNN)Birds' bodies are shrinking in response to climate change, even in places like the Amazon rainforest that are relatively untouched by human hands. Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.Researchers have studied information on more than 15,000 non-migratory birds spanning 77 species over a 40-year period that were captured in the Amazon rainforest, tagged and then released. The scientists found that nearly all of the birds' bodies have become lighter since the 1980s, losing on average about 2% of their body weight every decade, according to a new study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. For an average bird species that weighed about 30 grams (1 ounce) in the 1980s, the population now averages about 27.6 grams (0.97 ounce). The study also revealed that wingspan was getting bigger in a third of the Amazon bird species studied. It's a pattern that's also been spotted in North American migratory birds.""These birds don't vary that much in size. They are fairly fine-tuned, so when everyone in the population is a couple of grams smaller, it's significant,"" said coauthor Philip Stouffer, who is the Lee F. Mason Professor in the Louisiana State University School of Renewable Natural Resources.""This is undoubtedly happening all over and probably not just with birds,"" Stouffer said in a news release. ""If you look out your window, and consider what you're seeing out there, the conditions are not what they were 40 years ago, and it's very likely plants and animals are responding to those changes as well. We have this idea that the things we see are fixed in time, but if these birds aren't fixed in time, that may not be true.""Energy-efficient wingsBirds that lived higher up in the forest canopy, which were most exposed to heat and drier conditions, had the most dramatic changes in body weight and wing size, the researchers found. A lower body weight and increasing wing length means that birds use energy more efficiently, the researchers noted. For example, compared with a fighter jet with short wings that needs lots of fuel to fly, a glider plane with a thin body and long wings soars with much less energy. The study concluded that a warmer climate was the driving force of these changes, but the mechanism at play wasn't entirely clear. The climate in Brazilian Amazonia, where the birds lived, had gotten hotter and wetter, at least in the rainy season, over the study period.  Since 1966, rainfall increased by 13% in the wet season and fell by 15% in the dry, with temperatures increasing by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in the wet season and 1.65 degrees Celsius (2.97 degrees Fahrenheit) in the dry season.The change in climate might have made food or other resources scarcer, the study said.""Together, body proportions moved in the direction of more efficient flight and lower metabolic heat production and are consistent with a plastic or genetic adaptation to resource or thermal stress under climate change,"" the study said.  Animals are dealing with climate change in different ways. In the Mediterranean Sea, fish, crustaceans and mollusks are being found in deeper habitats as the water warms.Animals are evolving larger beaks, legs and ears that allow them to better regulate body temperature as the planet gets hotter, other research found.",2
294," (CNN)The man's voice trembled as he spoke, standing in the middle of an open field in southern Nicaragua. He was tense, despite the cool breeze and the mid-morning sunshine. If any of his government colleagues knew he was speaking to foreign journalists, he would surely be imprisoned.""I was afraid to talk with you,"" said the man, a local official who requested anonymity for his safety. ""It could have terrible consequences for my security if it leaked. But at the same time, the conviction and the hope that our voice will reach others around the world make us take risks.""He had waited to leave his home until after the government forces that check in on him every morning had left. They take photos and videos, he says, and tell him he must ""walk a straight line."" It's not an uncommon practice these days for anyone the Nicaraguan regime deems suspicious, the official said.Then he got in his car, made sure no one was following him, and went straight to the field -- the only place where he felt he could say what he needed to say without being overheard: ""We need this regime to fall,"" he said. ""There is no solution other than that...as long as this regime doesn't fall, Nicaragua will continue to be held hostage.""Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and his government have unleashed a campaign of political terror on the country. The 75-year-old, who just claimed a fifth term after Sunday's presidential vote, calls himself an elected president -- but many would call him the Western Hemisphere's newest dictator.Ortega was once a revolutionary. He himself took power after helping overthrow dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, but has spent the last few years cracking down brutally on dissenting voices.In June, Ortega's government began using a vague national security law as justification to lock up opposition presidential candidates, opposition leaders, journalists, human rights activists and others ahead of this month's election. Dozens have been hauled off to El Chipote, the notorious prison where Ortega himself was incarcerated as a young man in the 1970s.Ordinary citizens now live in fear of both the government and of each other, according to the dozen people inside Nicaragua who spoke to CNN. Neighbors rarely talk politics anymore for fear of being denounced as a traitor, they said.Under such conditions, Sunday's election has been widely discredited as a ""sham"" and a ""parody"" by democratic governments and human rights experts. But with no credible opposition candidates on the ballot, Ortega's government says he won more than 75 percent of the vote, according to the country's Supreme Electoral Council on Monday.A growing number of critics both inside and outside the country say the only solution now is for the international community to intervene, with proposals ranging from increasing sanctions to cutting off diplomatic relations. But the regime's campaign to silence critics does not stop at Nicaragua's borders -- Costa Rican government sources and anecdotal evidence suggests that agents of the Ortega regime have been stalking and threatening outspoken Nicaraguan exiles and, in some cases, are believed to have carried out physical violence abroad. Detailed questions sent to the Nicaraguan government and to the office of Vice President Rosario Murillo's office -- Ortega's wife and regime spokeswoman -- were not acknowledged or answered.'Is tomorrow an execution?'It was around 8 p.m. on October 2 in San José, Costa Rica, and Berenice Zeledón had lost her cell phone. She'd just left the flower shop owned by her close friend and fellow Nicaraguan Rayza Hope, so they both turned around and went back inside to look for it.As soon as Berenice reached her phone, the pair heard the metal door shut behind them.  A man had entered the shop, hooded and masked. His right hand held a pistol, brought level in a swift motion.Rayza expected a robbery. But she said their attacker spoke with a Nicaraguan accent and already knew their names.  ""At first I thought he was there to assault us,"" she said. ""But then he said, 'You need to stop f**king around, mother f**kers.'  Then I knew it was something else.""CNN agreed to use pseudonyms for both women to protect their identities.The pair begged him not to hurt them. But he started to strangle Rayza and pistol whipped her as she fell unconscious, the women later told police. He then attacked Berenice, shoving her to the ground with enough force that X-rays would show a fractured right knee.""The first thing I thought about was my son,"" said Berenice, tears sliding down her face.  ""This man is so determined; he's going to kill us.""But eventually, the man left. He stole nothing.When Rayza regained consciousness and spoke to Berenice, they both suspected the same thing -- that an agent of the Nicaraguan state had attacked them. That is what they told police when they filed a criminal report. Both women are relatively prominent in the Nicaraguan exile community in San José, a group whose numbers have surged recently.  Each is a vocal critic of the Ortega regime and participated in the country's anti-regime protests in 2018.Rayza is also a musician and has written and performed songs critical of the regime. Her Facebook page is littered with photos of her attending protests and marches calling for Ortega's removal from office.""I feel like people are watching me,"" said Berenice. ""I no longer feel safe.  He was clear. It was a warning to stop f**king around.  So, what happens tomorrow? Is it no longer a warning? Is tomorrow an execution?""CNN cannot verify if the attacker was Nicaraguan and Costa Rica police would not comment on the case.Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled their homeland and settled in Costa Rica to avoid persecution since 2018, when the government brutally cracked down on widespread anti-regime protests -- the beginning of a new escalation in political repression in the country.Now the Ortega regime is following them across the border, they say.The Costa Rican government denies that any such incursions into its territory have occurred. ""We have always been very vigilant on our borders,"" said Jorge Torres, Director of Costa Rica's Intelligence and Security Directorate, the country's main intelligence organization.  ""We are always maintaining a conversation [with Nicaragua] that shows respect to each other's sovereignty. We would not permit this type of threat.""But a senior government official in Costa Rica with deep knowledge of the situation told CNN that Nicaraguan intelligence operatives are indeed currently working in his country -- and that their numbers have risen since the 2018 popular exodus. Many of the operatives target Nicaraguan exiles, he said.""Yes, of course this is happening, I am completely sure that this is happening,"" said the official. ""We have evidence that they come here to do intelligence in Costa Rica and send the information to the government of Nicaragua.""His government is hesitant to speak out publicly on the issue for fear of damaging diplomatic relations at a tenuous time, he also said.Nicaraguan human rights groups say they too have recorded dozens of suspected regime-sponsored attacks in Costa Rica in recent years, though proving the Nicaraguan government is behind them is near impossible.More than a half-dozen exiles at the office of Unidad de Exiliados de Nicaraguenses, a Nicaraguan human rights group based in Costa Rica, told CNN they had received threats.The group's leader, Yefer Bravo, said his house had even been shot up by unknown assailants in 2019 in an attack he believes was carried out by Nicaraguan state agents.  He said he had previously been receiving threats online prior to the shooting.He reported the attack to Costa Rican police at the time but said no suspects were ever found or arrested. Police would not comment on his case.  ""The threats have become more direct and concrete,"" said Bravo.  ""I am constantly moving the locations where I live.""His group also faced increasing harassment in the months leading up to Sunday's elections. The threats mainly come online and don't become physical, he said. Nevertheless, they often paralyze their recipients with fear.Insults, stalking and death threatsJorge, who asked CNN to withhold his last name due to safety concerns, was active during anti-government protests in 2018 in his native Granada, a picturesque city south of Managua, where he was an active member of the Catholic Church. He was also a prominent figure in his neighborhood -- which is why, he believes, Nicaraguan police arrested him in January 2019. He was held for seven days in a police jail cell where he says he was tortured and interrogated.  He provided CNN a picture of his leg, where a clearly visible scar across nearly his entire thigh reads ""Plomo."" It means ""lead"" in Spanish and is often used as a death threat, including in Nicaragua where it is sometimes used as an acronym for a pro-government slogan, 'Patria Libre O Morir' -- Free Fatherland Or Death. Jorge says police carved it into his leg with a razor blade.   Police never formally charged him with a crime, he said. The Nicaraguan government did not respond to CNN's questions about his case.Nothing felt normal after his release. ""I was scared of any motorcycle passing by, any car, any noise. I was practically a prisoner in the place...I didn't even leave my room,"" said Jorge.A few months later, he says police returned to his rental home and spray painted it with the words 'SI JODES, TE MORIS' -- if you F**K AROUND, YOU DIE.His landlord promptly evicted him. Jorge fled to Guatemala where he says he felt safe until a photo appeared in his Facebook Messenger inbox, from an account he says belonged to a regime collaborator. The image showed him standing at the bus stop in Guatemala that he used every day to get to work.""You thought the Guatemalans would take care of you...You and your family are going to pay in blood,"" the accompanying text read.Jorge and his family fled again, this time even further north, to Mexico. He spoke to CNN from an undisclosed location. ""My family and I do not feel safe because we know what they can do. We wouldn't be the first or the last Nicaraguan to be murdered outside the country,"" said Jorge.The family of five is essentially living in limbo, with his wife and four daughters, ages 20, 14, 12 and 8 wondering what's next.The most recent threat he received came just a few weeks ago. Jorge had added his name to a list of migrants, organized by a Mexican non-profit group, who were hoping to find a way to legally travel to the United States. A picture of that list, which showed his name and his country of origin, was again sent to his Facebook account.""Hey, coup-plotter, did you think we weren't going to find you?  You and your family are going to pay for trying to bring down [Daniel Ortega],"" read the accompanying text. CNN has no way to verify if the accounts that sent these pictures are linked to the Nicaraguan government.The Nicaraguan government does appear to support a robust social media presence through troll factories, however. Meta said last week it recently uncovered a government-backed troll farm and removed nearly 1,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts associated with promoting pro-government content while attacking opposition accounts.With another term secured, where does it go from here?If these are the methods already employed by the Ortega regime, what might Nicaraguans inside and outside of the country expect from a regime newly emboldened by its victory at the polls this weekend and another five years in office?""It could possibly get worse...if the government of Daniel Ortega stays in power,"" said the senior Costa Rican government official. ""Things will get worse. I don't think they would get better.""For so many Nicaraguans who described harassment and fear to CNN, there is only one way out of the nightmare: A coordinated pressure campaign from the Nicaraguan diaspora and international community to hold real, free elections in their home country, or else force the Ortega regime to relinquish power entirely.Gone are their hopes for internal, democratic pressure. In the current climate of intimidation, protesters in Nicaragua are banned from filling the streets, opposition candidates are swiftly arrested, and newspapers cannot report the truth without fear of retribution.The pressure must come externally, says Bravo, the head of Unidad de Exiliados Nicaraguenses. No matter the threats that he and his fellow exiles might receive, there is a sense of duty among them -- a feeling that they are responsible for the direction of their country and the lives of their countrymen still inside.""If we don't do anything for Nicaragua, if we don't raise our voices to the international community, if we don't pressure the United Nations, the [Organization of American States], the US Congress, the European Union, to make it clear what is happening in Nicaragua, who else will do it?""",2
295," (CNN)They've been called ""a parody,"" ""a sham,"" and ""the worst possible conditions"" for a vote, but Nicaragua's general elections went ahead this weekend anyway -- the first since a wave of popular demonstrations rattled the country in 2018. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega claimed victory on Monday, with over 97% of votes counted, according to the country's Supreme Electoral Council -- a win that resulted after a months-long government crackdown on his potential political rivals. The septuagenarian strongman will now enter a fifth term, alongside his vice president and wife, Rosario Murillo.According to Nicaragua's electoral council, 65.23% of voters turned up to the polls. ""Massive participation in all the municipalities,"" reported government-run outlet El 19 Digital over the weekend, which described long lines conducted in ""order, peace and tranquility.""However, Urnas Abiertas, a civil electoral observatory group, said abstention rates averaged more than 80% across the country -- amounting to a boycott of the electoral process that several Nicaraguans described firsthand. ""Going to vote is a joke,"" a high-ranking clergy member of the Catholic Church in Nicaragua told CNN by text message. ""The people are fearful and locked in their houses."" ""A lot of the people I know are not leaving their homes,"" said another Nicaraguan in the city of Granada, asking to remain anonymous for safety reasons. Driving through town, the streets and polling stations he saw were empty, he added.An empty fieldAt least half a dozen likely presidential contenders had been detained ahead of the vote, clearing Ortega's path to another five years in office. Though five other presidential candidates were listed on the final ballot Sunday, none were seen as strong challengers.Among the arrested were former candidate and journalist Cristiana Chamorro Barrios (whose mother defeated Ortega at the polls in 1990); her cousin, the economist Juan Sebastián Chamorro García; former diplomat Arturo Cruz; political scientist Félix Maradiaga; journalist Miguel Mora Barberena; and rural labor leader Medardo Mairena Sequeira. Dozens of other prominent critics and opposition leaders were also detained and investigated for alleged national security concerns, according to Nicaraguan law enforcement -- moves that much of the international community has criticized as political repression.""We have a right, as Nicaraguans, to open investigations against terrorists and defend the peace,"" Ortega said during a press conference with Murillo on Sunday.Furthering concerns that the deck was stacked in favor of the current President and his party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), the country's Ortega-aligned electoral council had limited campaigning and the eligibility of political parties -- creating what the Organization of American States Secretary General Luis Almagro described in May as ""the worst possible circumstances for an electoral process."" Misinformation and the manipulation of social networks have emerged as another possible contaminant in the electoral process. Facebook last week said it had removed a troll farm of more than 1,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts backed by the government, Reuters reported. The accounts had been working to amplify pro-government content, according to the news agency. Throughout it all, the specter of Covid-19 has loomed over the vote. Though the country has officially counted fewer than 20,000 cases and just 209 deaths since the start of the pandemic, health experts say the reality could be more severe than reported. According to the Pan American Health Organization, less than 20% of Nicaragua's population has been vaccinated.'A parody of an election'The Ortega government's tactics to stifle competition have prompted condemnation from democratic governments and members of the Nicaraguan diaspora around the world, with weekend demonstrations organized in the Costa Rican capital San José, Miami, Florida, and Madrid, Spain.Even before the results were announced, the governments of Colombia, Chile and Costa Rica said on Monday they would not recognize the outcome. The UK, US and EU also issued statements challenging the legitimacy of the vote.""What Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, orchestrated today was a pantomime election that was neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic,"" US President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday that called on the ruling pair to release detained political dissidents. Venezuela and Cuba, however, congratulated Nicaragua on its vote. And Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday slammed US criticism as ""unacceptable,"" saying that Nicaragua's elections were held ""in an orderly manner, in full compliance with the Nicaraguan legislation"" according to Russian electoral observers sent to the country, during a press conference by Russian state news agency TASS.Regional governments have long voiced concern over the Ortega regime's pre-election crackdown. Following a wave of arrests this summer, Mexico and Argentina recalled their ambassadors for consultations, citing ""worrying legal actions by the Nicaraguan government.""At a November 3 meeting about a new report on Nicaragua's political repression by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, US representative Bradley Freden described the Nicaraguan election as ""nothing more than a sham"" and Canadian representative Hugh Adsett panned it as ""a parody of an election."" The European Union's chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, earlier described Nicaragua's election as so ""completely fake"" that it would not be worth sending independent observers. Both the European Union and United States have imposed sanctions on senior Nicaraguan officials, including members of the Ortega-Murillo family. The United States is also poised to levy further punitive financial measures after Sunday's vote.Ortega and Murillo's tightening grip on powerOrtega came to power as part of the Sandinista rebels who overthrew the Somoza dynasty in 1979, and fought against the US-backed Contras during the 1980s. First elected in 1985, he has since demolished Nicaragua's presidential term limits, allowing him to run over and over again. Increasingly, however, Ortega has retreated from the public eye, with weeks and even months passing between appearances. His wife, Rosario Murillo, is now the recognized face and voice of the administration, with an idiosyncratic daily radio broadcast.Over the years, the pair have inexorably consolidated power, appointing loyalists to top government roles and exerting an increasingly tight grip on the country's social and political spheres. Local press describe a climate of fear and intimidation. ""They're fearful of losing their grip on power,"" said Julie Chung, the acting Assistant Secretary for the US Department of State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, in June. ""As such, that fear of democracy, I think, has contributed to triggering these kinds of actions, repressive actions, because they have no confidence in their own ability to have the people support them.""Anti-government protests in 2018, sparked by uproar over a plan to pare down the country's social security programs, offered a striking example of the government's intolerance for dissent.Pro-government armed groups arbitrarily detained hundreds of participants, attacked churches and universities where demonstrators were thought to be hiding, and allegedly blocked the injured from accessing medical care.At least 322 people were killed then, according to rights groups, with thousands injured and hundreds detained. At the time, UN human rights experts accused the government of human rights violations against protesters. Ortega said the UN report was ""nothing more than an instrument of the policy of death, of the policy of terror, of the policy of lying, of the policy of infamy.""Hundreds of protesters and activists are believed to still be detained, according to a report by the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights in February, and more than 100,000 Nicaraguans have fled the country, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.Anti-government protests were subsequently banned. Even waving the country's flag in public -- a key symbol of the 2018 demonstrations -- was criminalized.Today, civic participation feels pointless, one young woman told CNN on Sunday. ""Years ago during elections, there were lines at the polls and people wanted to participate,"" she said. Though she had boycotted the vote, she pointed out that others in Nicaragua are not free to do even that, with government employees under particular scrutiny.""My father works for the state and if he doesn't vote, he'll be fired. It's a way to force people to vote, it's not voluntary,"" she said.Her only hope is to leave the country, she added. ""I don't see a future here. Unless Daniel Ortega and that woman die, nothing will change. There is no life here.""",2
296," (CNN)Some 3,000 baby river turtles native to the Amazon rainforest were released into a Peruvian river on Thursday after hatching from eggs kept on artificial beaches as part of a conservation effort.The river turtles are considered ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and have for many years been killed for human consumption, or kept as pets.""The importance lies in the conservation of the species in the area because it has already been threatened for a long time,"" said Sabrina Pipa, a biologist who works on the protection of freshwater turtles.""The objective is the repopulation of the species.""The turtles carry the scientific name Podocnemis unifilis, but Peruvians call them taricayas. They are yellow-spotted and the baby ones measure just a couple of inches.Peru has the second largest share of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil.Scientists agree that conserving the Amazon rainforest is vital to avoid catastrophic climate change because of its ability to absorb greenhouse gases.But over the past two decades, more than 19,700 square kilometers (7,600 square miles) of the Peruvian Amazon have been destroyed.Pipa said the taricaya project began in 2019 and had protected about 6,000 river turtles, in addition to those conserved this year.People gathered in the city of Iquitos to see the baby turtles make their way down a river beach towards the water.""Go! Go be happy!,"" one onlooker chanted.",2
297,"São Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Brazilian country music star Marília Mendonça died in a plane crash on Friday in a rural region of the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, according to her public relations firm.She was en route to a concert at the time of the crash, which killed four other people in addition to the singer. Mendonça, 26, is survived by her 1-year-old son, according to CNN Brasil.The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but in a statement on Friday, the Minas Gerais Electric Company (CEMIG) said Mendonça's plane had hit a cable on an electric tower belonging to the power firm.Minas Gerais police chief Ivan Lopes Sales said at a news conference Friday that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash but added the dispersed debris field suggested the aircraft had ""hit something before the plane fell.""News of the death of the charismatic Latin Grammy winner, known as ""the Boss"" to her millions of fans, shocked the country Friday. Prominent Brazilians, including football star Neymar, came forward in the wake of the news to share their grief.Mendonça quickly rose to fame in the popular sertanejo country music genre and made her mark by singing about women's empowerment in an environment traditionally dominated by male musicians. She was the most-listened to artist in Brazil on Spotify in 2019 and 2020, according to her PR firm, and had more than 38 million followers on Instagram.Neymar, a close friend of the singer, wrote on Twitter: ""I refuse to believe it, I refuse.""Ronaldo Caiado, governor of Mendonça's home state of Goiás, said her family had confirmed a funeral for the singer would begin around 8 a.m. local time Saturday in an arena in the state capital, Goiânia. Caiado wrote on Twitter that he expects up to 100,000 mourners at her funeral.Caetano Veloso, a septuagenarian stalwart of the Brazilian genre MPB -- Brazilian pop music -- praised her on Twitter as the ""marvelous Mendonça"" and said the news had left him in tears.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the ""entire country"" was in ""shock"" over the news of her death, while Rio de Janeiro Gov. Claudio Castro called her loss a ""tragic accident.""""Young and talented, Marília was the protagonist of a new chapter of Brazilian country music and inspiration for several singers in the segment. The country is shocked and mourns this loss that came too early,"" Castro said in a news release.",2
298,"Bogota (CNN)Nicaragua's upcoming election on November 7 is expected to hold no surprises, after strongman president Daniel Ortega spent most of the year tightening his grip on the country. With seven opposition candidates behind bars and thousands of critics abroad to escape the oppressive control of Ortega's police, the septuagenarian leader and his colorful wife, Rosario Murillo, look undisputedly in control of the vote outcome. The biggest question now isn't who will win -- but how the rest of the region will react once Ortega declares victory.                                                                               Democracy has been eroding across Latin America: From north to south, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated a trend of regional caudillos seizing the political stage and working to weaken democratic checks and balances.In February 2020, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele ordered the military to raid parliament to ""spur"" lawmakers to authorize a loan to his government. In August this year, his example was followed by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who organized a military parade in Brasilia just as Congress was debating a Bolsonaro-backed reform of the voting system (the reform did not pass). According to a regional survey of over 20,000 people by polling firm Latinobarometro, less than 50% of Latin Americans polled in 2020 say democracy is preferable to any other form of government and more than one in ten openly advocate for an authoritarian regime.Support for authoritarianism is strongest in younger generations, showed the poll, with 49% of people aged 16-25 saying they either support an authoritarian regime or are indifferent to the form of government.And indifference to democratic government seems particularly acute in Central America, with the majority of poll respondents in the impoverished Northern Triangle nations Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador saying they would be in favor of a non-democratic government ""if it resolves the country's problems.""Two challenges for the regionIn June, former Costa Rican president Laura Chinchilla described a spate of arrests by the Ortega administration as ""the night of the long knives in the tropics,"" while US State Department spokesman Ned Price has said repressive conditions in Nicaragua are simply ""not consistent with credible elections.""But the vote is going ahead anyway. And now having intimidated or locked up all viable political opponents, Ortega's expected reelection in Nicaragua presents two challenges to the rest of the region: Will other leaders speak out against this subversion of democratic processes? And how will the many multilateral systems designed to defend democracy in Latin America -- the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the Organization of American States, and smaller groups like the Pacific Alliance or the Andean Community -- reckon with their failure to prevent Nicaragua's slide toward a dictatorship?While many countries have condemned the arrest of opposition figures in Nicaragua -- and the US has even imposed sanctions -- they may be hesitant to push much further after being burned by their experience with Venezuela in recent years.After a contested election in 2019, dozens of foreign governments chose not to acknowledge strongman Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, favoring instead opposition leader Juan Guaido. But the strategy backfired -- two years later, Maduro retains control of the country and has effectively won his battle against international pressure.""I think the Venezuelan crisis caused a certain caution among the international community over what to do in Nicaragua,"" says Tiziano Breda, a Central American analyst at the International Crisis Group.""After investing so much on Guaidó, and creating this impasse in Venezuela that has not resolved the crisis there, there is less clarity of what an alternative strategy for Nicaragua could be: opposing Ortega, sure, but what is the alternative?"" Breda told CNN.  One likely reason Venezuela's political crisis triggered so much regional reaction is because it went hand-in-hand with a migration crisis: 4.6 million Venezuelans have so far fled the country, according to UNHCR. In contrast, political oppression in Nicaragua has not triggered a similar mass exodus that would force its neighbors to act -- at least not yet.",2
299," (CNN)The International Criminal Court (ICC) will formally investigate allegations of crimes against humanity in Venezuela, the court announced Wednesday.ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan and Venezuela's embattled President Nicolas Maduro signed a ""'Letter of Understanding' to facilitate cooperation and mutual assistance to advance accountability for atrocity crimes,"" the court said.The Maduro government has been under preliminary examination at the ICC since February 2018. The court is determining whether Venezuela merits a trial for alleged crimes against humanity. The United Nations has accused Venezuelan security forces of using excessive force and arbitrarily detaining thousands of people over the course of several months during protests against Maduro's government.More than 120 people died in protest-related incidents, according to the UN Human Rights Office, which based its estimates on interviews with demonstrators and witnesses.CNN has not been able to independently confirm those claims.""The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has concluded the preliminary examination of the situation in Venezuela,"" the letter reads, ""and has determined that it is appropriate to open an investigation to determine the truth in accordance with the Rome Statue.""Venezuela ""considers that the allegations should be investigated in the country by existing national institutions created for this purpose"" but ""despite the differences of views on this issue, the parties remain committed to actively engaged with each other and support efforts further to the principle of complementarity,"" it also says.""I am fully aware of the fault lines that exist in Venezuela, the geopolitical divisions that exist, we are not political, we are guided by the principals of legality and the rule of law,"" said Khan after signing the letter of understanding.Maduro, also after signing the letter on Wednesday, said: ""the doors of Venezuela are open because we want truth, because we want justice, because we want to improve, because Venezuela guarantees justice.""Opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who has been backed by dozens of countries as Venezuela's legitimate president, welcomed the move by the court.""The formal opening of the investigation for crimes against humanity, by the International Criminal Court, vindicates the right to obtain justice that has been denied in Venezuela for the victims and their families,"" Guaidó said Wednesday on his official Twitter account.Despite broad international support for Guaido, Maduro has managed to retain power amid a collapsing economy and US-backed efforts to remove him from power through coordinated Western sanctions.""This decision -- the first in Latin American history -- gives hope of justice to the hundreds of victims of brutal repression by the Maduro regime,"" said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, on his official Twitter account Wednesday.",2
300,"Havana, Cuba (CNN)A skinny, bespectacled, left-leaning playwright whose works until recently were promoted by the government would seem an unlikely candidate to become Cuba's public enemy number one. But Cuban officials are increasingly taking aim at Yunior Garcia Aguilera and his proposal to hold a peaceful political march later this month -- for which the state has already denied permission. ""Cubans have spent too much time in silence,"" Garcia Aguilera said during an interview in his cramped apartment in the downtrodden San Agustín neighborhood of Havana. ""It's time to open our mouths with liberty and say what we think."" Garcia Aguilera is not the typical anti-government Cuban dissident. He has worked for years in state-run theater and television productions, is critical of the US embargo on the island and says he is more liberal than Cuba's ""conservative"" leadership. Cuban state-run media this week compared him to renowned Czech playwright and human rights advocate Vaclav Havel, although the description was not meant as a compliment.His planned march is intended to call for democratic reforms to the Caribbean nation's political system, as well as the release of political prisoners. In response, the Cuban state has targeted him with an onslaught of accusations. Cuban state TV has broadcast recording of Garcia Aguilera's personal phone calls, and aired programs alleging murky ties between the playwright and dark forces allegedly bent on toppling Cuba's more than six-decade-old revolution.  In one phone call, Garcia Aguilera can be heard having a perfunctory conversation with a well-known anti-Castro Cuban exile Ramon Saul Sanchez, who offers Garcia Aguilera his support. Cuban government officials treated the call as damning evidence that the playwright has been in touch with Cuban exiles in Florida, whom the government accuses of plotting terrorist attacks on the island.  And in a video that aired Monday on the Cuba's Reasons television program, a local doctor named Carlos Leonardo Vázquez González showed photos of a conference that he said he attended with Garcia Aguilera and other Cuban government critics in Madrid in 2019. Vázquez González also said in the program that he was actually a double agent, reporting back to Cuban state security on Garcia Aguilera. ""What we are seeing in Yunior is the creation and performance of a counterrevolutionary,"" Vázquez González said. Garcia Aguilera confirmed the authenticity of the phone call and the conference but said they were misrepresented on TV. He denies receiving any funding from foreign governments or exile groups, and insists that he is pushing for democratic change from within Cuba using legal avenues. In support of his plan to protest, Garcia Aguilera formed a group called Archipelago, which has over 31,000 followers on Facebook. Group members say they too are harassed for their activism, and complain of being followed by plainclothes state security agents and receiving threats by government officials.  Members also accuse Cuba's state telecom provider of preventing Cubans from texting the word archipelago in Spanish or the date of their planned protest -- a long-established censorship tactic on the island. CNN has independently confirmed the messaging block. In October, Garcia Aguilera posted pictures on social media of the carcass and blood and feathers of a dead bird that were spread across the entrance to his apartment in the middle of the night -- a gory scene that he understood as a warning to halt his activism.  He blamed the government for the vandalism, saying that police monitoring his house would have been aware of who was responsible. Cuban officials have not responded to his allegations of harassment. On Monday, Garcia Aguilera's wife also filmed neighbors carrying out a nighttime ""acto de repudio"" or ""act of repudiation"" -- chanting government slogans at the couple's doorstep and ""warning"" him to stop his activism. Nevertheless, Garcia Aguilera and a handful of other protest organizers say they are intent on moving forward with their planned march. They say they want peaceful protesters arrested after demonstrations on July 11 to be released, more guarantees for individual freedoms and a lifting of official censorship. A dangerous time to protestSpeaking out against the island's communist-run government carries even greater risks than usual, after the state was rattled by widespread protests in July, increased US economic sanctions and the implosion of their tourism industry during the pandemic. According to the Cubalex group that monitors legal issues on the island, at least 1,175 Cubans were arrested following the July 11 protests when scores of people took to the streets to demand greater freedoms and economic conditions -- the largest demonstration to take place in Cuba since the 1959 revolution. While government officials said they targeted protestors who attacked police and looted stores, dozens of people said they were violently arrested for marching peacefully or merely filming the protests. Government officials insist that the island's constitution grants Cubans the right to protest, but in practice, demonstrations are quickly broken up by police and government critics are accused of being ""mercenaries"" in the employ of Cuba's Cold War nemesis, the United States.  ""Having different opinions, including political ones, doesn't constitute a crime,"" said Rubén Remigio Ferro, the president of the Supreme People's Court of Cuba, at a press conference in July shortly after the protests. ""Thinking differently, questioning what's going on, to demonstrate is not a crime."" Those comments indicating an opening for some dissent are what inspired Garcia Aguilera and other members of the Archipelago group to apply to hold peaceful marches in various cities across the island, the playwright told CNN. The Cuban government however has described the planned marches as a pretext invented by Cuban exiles and the US government that would lead to an invasion of Cuba ""by the enemy."" It has announced island-wide military exercises for the same day. ""[The protest] promoters, their public projections and ties with subversive organizations or agencies financed by the US government have the open intention of changing the political system in our country,"" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said at a speech before the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party in October. Already Cuba's state-run run media has broadcast images of militias training with AK-47's and members of ""Committee's for the Defense of the Revolution"" patrolling streets with metal batons.   Garcia Aguilera has since moved the proposed march from November 20 to November 15, although the Cuban government is unlikely to allow protestors to take part regardless of the date. He said the government's overreaction to his proposed march has only proven his point.  ""They have shown there's no rule of law,"" he said. ""There's no possibility for citizens to legally, peacefully and orderly show their dissent to those power."" With so much tension in the air, it's unclear how many Cubans will join Garcia Aguilera's call to protest but already the initiative threatens to further deteriorate frayed US and Cuban relations. ""The Cuban regime is failing to meet the people's most basic needs. That includes food. That includes medicine. Now is a chance to listen to the Cuban people and to make a positive change,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said In October. The Biden administration has warned the Cuban government that if it prevents the march from taking take place, the island could face further economic sanctions.",2
301," (La Paz)Bolivia's highlands city of La Paz has been hit by an unusual heatwave, with levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation soaring off the charts, exacerbated by unusually low levels of cloud cover some experts link to climate change.Levels of UV radiation have at times in recent weeks hit 21 on a scale that normally only goes up as far as 20. According to the World Health Organization, a UV index of 11 is regarded as ""extreme,"" with people cautioned to avoid exposure to the sun.""The sun is burning. This sun isn't normal,"" said La Paz resident Segundina Mamani, as people in the city at 3,600 meters (11,800 feet) above sea level tried to keep cool by eating shaved ice and keeping to the shadows.The high-altitude Andean regions of South America can be hit by some of the most dangerous levels of UV radiation in the world, with numbers that have at times reached record heights of above 40 on the index. But a number between 11 and 17 is more typical.""This is an issue that has literally had La Paz cooking,"" said Juan Pablo Palma, a risk management official with the municipal government.With world leaders meeting in Glasgow for the COP26 climate conference amid warnings that the climate light is flashing red, some Bolivian scientists said changing rainfall patterns were sharpening the effects of UV radiation by reducing cloud cover.""We have confirmed what many say: the rainy season can bring the same amount of rain but it's shorter,"" said Luis Blacutt, a researcher at the atmospheric physics laboratory in La Paz, who has made climate change models to study the trend.While some rains brought relief this week, the laboratory expects the high UV levels to last at least for another week.""That means that the development of clouds is delayed, the input of ultraviolet radiation is more noticeable... Now that there are no clouds, we have an entry of a large amount of ultraviolet radiation that affects everyone,"" said Blacutt.",2
302,"Atacama Desert, Chile,In Chile's dry Atacama Desert, stargazers are scanning the clear night skies to detect the existence of life on other planets and study so-called ""dark energy,"" a mysterious cosmic force thought to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe.Central to the race to peer into distant worlds is the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), a $1.8 billion complex being built at the Las Campanas observatory and which will have a resolution 10 times higher than the Hubble space telescope.The telescope, expected to begin operation by the end of the decade, will compete with the European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope -- located further north in the same desert -- as well as the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) being built in Hawaii.""This new generation of giant telescopes is aimed precisely at detecting life on other planets and to determine the origin of dark energy,"" said Leopoldo Infante, director of the Las Campanas observatory.""It's a race by these three groups for who makes it first and who makes the first discovery.""Infante said the new giant telescope would be able to detect organic molecules in the atmosphere of distant planets.""That is the expectation,"" he said. ""And whoever detects life on another planet will win the Nobel Prize, I assure you.""The other prize is studying dark energy -- separate from the similarly enigmatic dark matter -- which is considered to be a property of space and is driving the universe's accelerated expansion. It makes up a huge amount of the universe, but remains mostly an unsolved mystery.""There is an energy that is causing the universe to expand, but also to accelerate that expansion,"" said Infante, adding scientists knew that this energy must exist, though they did not understand its origin.""So this telescope is designed to be able to study precisely what is called the dark energy of the universe, to be able to understand physically what that energy is and where that energy comes from.""",2
303,"Sao Paulo (CNN)Brazil is heading to the UN climate summit in Glasgow with ambitious environmental promises, including cutting emissions 50% and ending illegal deforestation entirely by 2030, as well as becoming carbon neutral by 2050.But can the administration of current President Jair Bolsonaro be believed? It has won little credibility with local environmental advocates, after previously dismantling federal legislation and environmental agencies intended to combat deforestation, and promoting increased mining and oil extraction in indigenous territories and publicly protected lands. The government has also favored investments and credit to grow the country's agricultural industry -- a sector often at odds with the protection of Brazil's vast wild lands. Bolsonaro himself has also decided not to attend COP 26 personally -- raising questions about his personal commitment to tackling climate change. Although Brazil is taking the second largest delegation to COP26, it is led by Environment Minister Joaquim Leite.  ""I reinforce our commitment to generating a neutral greenhouse gas economy at the same time creating jobs and creating income contributions to Brazil,"" Leite said at the Brazil pavilion in Glasgow on Monday. ""Brazil is part of the solution,"" he promised, echoing Bolsonaro's pre-recorded video message to the summit. How Brazil will do itBrazil's environment ministry last week unveiled a ""Green Growth"" program to achieve its climate goals. In a press release, it said the program would attract investments from the world market and generate sustainable jobs. Bolsonaro signed two decrees establishing the program and an oversight commission, but so far the government has not articulated any specific targets or accountability mechanisms to measure the success of the program. Most crucially, perhaps, the program outline does not address preventing deforestation on the federal level. Deforestation is the biggest cause of greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil, which is the world's sixth largest carbon emitter according to environmental watchdog the Climate Observatory. Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions shot up by 9.5% in 2020 -- the opposite of pandemic-induced trends in other parts of the world -- according to data collected by the Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation System, a platform that monitors greenhouse emissions in Brazil. The cause? Deforestation.""If the Brazilian forest were a country, it would be the ninth largest emitter in the world, ahead of Germany,"" says the study.  Bolsonaro, who is up for election next year, has long positioned himself as a pro-business president focused first and foremost on bolstering the country's economy. Fittingly, most anticipated ""green growth"" projects are designed to compensate farmers and ranchers for protecting the environment, improving their technologies so they can become low-emission producers, helping them to access the carbon market, and investing in the biofuel industry.  ""The biggest challenge of 'green businesses' is to undo the idea that government actions are only punitive,"" Leite told the audience during the ceremony on Oct 25.  One of the programs named Green Rural Producer Certificate ""represents a payment instrument for environmental services to farmers in order to promote environmental conservation, as well as the adoption of technologies and good practices that reconcile agricultural and forestry productivity, with a reduction in environmental impacts,"" according to the statement.Another project called 'Forest + Agro' aims to offer financial incentives to rural producers to protect reserves and areas of permanent protection. But the main project is the Plano ABC+, which offers a line of credit to producers to promote low carbon farming.  But Sergio Leitão, director of Brazil's Escolhas Institute, a sustainable development-focused think tank, says the plan merely restates existing sustainable development goals without committing new resources to them.  ""When you look at this plan, it has nothing. It repackages pre-existing projects and commissions. And those projects already exist, but investments for a sustainable and low-carbon agribusiness are still very low,"" says Leitão, referring to government investments. Suely Araujo, senior public policy specialist at the Climate Observatory, adds that she doubts the government's ability to monitor the sustainability of rural producers.  ""Today, the instrument that they would use to certify and compensate rural properties -- the CAR (Rural Environmental Registry) -- has not yet reached its final stage, which is when the information given by the farmer is cross checked and confirmed by the state agencies,"" says Suely Araujo. Failure to stem deforestation so farThe Bolsonaro administration's track record so far has been poor. During Bolsonaro's first year in office, in 2019, deforestation in the Amazon rose 34%. The next year, it rose another 7%, according to INPE, the government agency that monitors deforestation in the country.  This year, INPE predicts a small reduction in deforestation rate of around 1 to 2% -- but that still means that from January 2021 to September, over 7,000 square kilometers of forest were destroyed, an area nearly nine times the size of New York City. Ninety percent of all deforested areas in the Amazon biome have been turned into pastures, according to an August report by the sustainable development research group Imazon, or Amazon Institute of Man and Environment.  The government has also cut funds and promoted the dismantling of environmental agencies and rolled back the protection of the remaining forest areas, including indigenous territories, national or state parks, extractive reserves, and all land that remain under the power of the state.  Parts of the Amazon, which serves as a carbon sink for the world, are now turning into a source of carbon emission not just because of deforestation, fires and land occupation but because increasingly dry conditions are stressing trees, according to a recent study by INPE's Greenhouse Gas Laboratory. ""Deforestation causes an impact during the dry season conditions. Dry season conditions become hotter, drier and longer. These make the forest itself to be more stressed, leading trees to die, and this causes more emission than absorption. This forest becomes a source because the mortality (of trees) is bigger than the growth from the forest,"" says one of the lead researchers Luciana Gatti. Meanwhile, two bills are currently being debated in Congress that could further encourage deforestation: They would grant amnesty for illegal land occupation, facilitating the regularization of illegally deforested public lands, and the mining and other activities in indigenous territories. A country already at riskBrazil has already suffered from a series of severe climate crises during the past year: extreme temperatures followed by intense floods, severe droughts, which resulted in its worst water shortages in over 90 years.  According to the National Electric System Operator, water scarcity in reservoirs and hydroelectric dams has also created an energy crisis, forcing the country to turn on its thermoelectrics and to import energy from neighboring countries.  Intense drought and record frosts this year have also harmed agricultural production in Brazil. The National Supply Company (Conab) has forecast a total 2021 grain production volume 1.2% lower than last year, despite its planted area having increased by 4%.  The effects of Brazil's unsustainable development so far can be seen clearly in the Amazonian state of Rondônia. Flying over the state in September with the Amazon in Flames Alliance, a partnership of environmental organizations, CNN could see farms and cattle ranches become sparser upon approach to Mapinguari National Park. But within a few miles, large scars of burnt forest and trees still in flames became visible -- areas that will soon turn into pasture.  According to Brazilian land-use mapping project MapBiomas, Rondônia has the fastest deforestation rate between 1985 and 2020 in Brazil, losing about 38% of its total native forest coverage.  Rondonia's remaining forest is found today only within conservation areas, namely public parks, indigenous territories and reserves. It has become a series of disconnected fragments of forest that suffer constant incursion by illegal loggers, miners and land grabbers.  A dangerous country for environmentalismAnd while the Brazilian government may present an optimistic front at COP26 this month, many of those striving for a better planet at home are risking their lives.  Last year, 20 land and environmental defenders were murdered in Brazil, according to monitoring organization Global Witness.  Members of the Rioterra Study Center, an organization that works on the development of projects that combine conservation and sustainability in Rondônia, told CNN they have recently faced death threats due to their work. Milton da Costa, who works at the Rioterra organization coordinating large scale projects of land restoration and reforestation inside Conservation Units, was ambushed by two armed men in mid September this year and received death threats for trying to implement a reforestation project near the city of Machadinho d'Oeste.""I looked at him and saw that he was also carrying a gun, probably a 38 (pistol). The other guy was telling him: shoot him, shoot him right away. Then he just said, 'No, we simply came here to deliver him a message, if he doesn't stop planting these trees there, then we'll come back',"" da Costa recounts. ",2

305,"Jerusalem (CNN)A 26-year old Israeli man has died after a Hamas gunman carried out a shooting attack in Jerusalem's Old City.  The dead man has been named as Eliyahu David Kay, a recent immigrant from South Africa who worked as a guide at the Western Wall. Authorities corrected the victim's age that they had earlier reported.Four other people -- among them a man whose condition was described as serious -- were injured in the incident, which happened on Sunday morning near the Chain Gate entrance to the al Aqsa mosque compound, also known as the Temple Mount.  The assailant, who used an improvised automatic weapon commonly known as a Carlo, police say, was shot dead by police officers on the scene.  Israel's public security minister Omar Bar Lev said the gunman was from the neighborhood of Shuafat in east Jerusalem and a member of the political wing of Hamas. Hamas issued a statement identifying the attacker as Fadi Abu Shkaydam, calling him a heroic martyr and describing him as a local leader of the movement. It said the attack was ""a response to the attempts to desecrate Al Aqsa mosque.""   Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told government ministers he was praying for the recovery of the wounded and had instructed security forces to prepare for possible ""copycat attacks."" ""We need to be on heightened alert and prevent future attacks,"" he said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. In a separate development Sunday, police now say they are treating a stabbing incident in the city of Jaffa as possible terrorism.  A 67-year old man was moderately wounded, police said, after being stabbed by an unknown person who then ran away.  ""The findings from the initial investigation reinforce suspicions that it was carried out for nationalist reasons,"" a later police report said. Four days ago, a 16-year old Palestinian was shot dead after carrying out a stabbing attack on two Israeli border police in the Old City, police said.",2
306," (CNN)A rare storm in Egypt has sparked flash floods that killed at least three people and washed swarms of scorpions into people's homes. More than 500 people were stung by scorpions who sought refuge from thunderstorms and torrential rainfall in the southern Egyptian city of Aswan over the weekend. Wounded Aswan residents were transferred to hospitals to receive anti-venom injections, Egypt's state-run Al Ahram newspaper said. The Aswan area normally receives around 1 millimeter of rainfall per year, making the heavy thunder and hail storms on Friday a rare event. Egypt's fat-tailed scorpions, which normally dwell in the desert, are among the deadliest in the world. Without treatment, people can die within an hour of being stung. Three members of Egypt's security forces were killed in the flash floods -- the worst of their kind in 11 years, according to Aswan's governor Ashraf Attia. The torrential rainfall in Aswan's desert destroyed homes and damaged roads and trees.

An explosive device was attached to the car while the journalists were driving near the Abyan seashore, the country's state-run agency reported. Al-Atmy survived the blast but was seriously injured, according to the Yemen Journalist Syndicate (YJS).""The Syndicate considers this crime a reprehensible precedent, and expresses fear that it serves as a dangerous indicator of a new and violent phase targeting journalists in Yemen,"" the YJS said.Video filmed by Reuters showed the aftermath of the explosion, with several onlookers inspecting the charred husk of the vehicle on the side of the road.

310," (CNN)The United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdallah bin Zayed met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus on Tuesday, in the most senior Emirati visit to the country since the start of Syria's war in 2011. The visit is the biggest signal of a normalization of regional ties with Assad's government since the Syrian dictator's brutal quelling of a popular uprising prompted his diplomatic isolation. It is also the most high-profile meeting between Assad and an Arab official since former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir flew to the Syrian capital several days before his ouster in 2019. The UAE's top diplomat discussed developing ""bilateral cooperation in various fields of common interest and developing cooperation"" between the two countries, according to the Syrian presidency statement. Assad also thanked the UAE for their support ""in overcoming [Syria's] challenges imposed by the war."" The Syrian presidency statement cited Sheikh Abdallah as saying that ""what happened in Syria affected all Arab nations."" Sheikh Abdallah has been a vocal opponent of a US sanctions regime against the Assad government known as the Caesar Act. In 2018, the UAE reopened their Damascus embassy, helping spearhead a regional bid to reintegrate the Syrian government into the regional diplomatic arena.The move to normalize regional ties with Damascus has encountered resistance from the US and other Western countries who fear that ending Assad's isolation would empower the Syrian dictator and reduce any chance of accountability for his alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Assad government denies those charges. But while official Western policy towards Assad's government remains unchanged, opposition to normalizing ties appeared to wane over the last year. Washington has tacitly approved a new gas pipeline to Lebanon which aims to alleviate the country's crippling fuel shortages but runs through Syria, violating the sanctions campaign against the Assad regime. Washington has also largely refrained from publicly criticizing recent Arab diplomatic overtures to Damascus.  ""His Highness in Damascus paves the path for the return of Syria to the Arab embrace,"" tweeted prominent Emirati analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla along with a photo of Sheikh Abdalla. In recent years, Abu Dhabi has emerged as a major power broker in the crisis-ridden region and moved to mend ties with traditional foes. In August 2019, the country normalized ties with Israel, and it has also sought to repair a strained diplomatic relationship with Iran.",2

The rights groups who uncovered the hacking of staff at Palestinian NGOs have not accused any particular government of ordering the Pegasus hack, but in a joint statement referenced NSO Group's headquarters location in the Israeli city of Herzliya. ""NSO Group's headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, are less than a hundred kilometers from where the hacked Palestinian organizations work,"" the statement said. ""Not only has this technology been exported to countries where it has facilitated human rights abuse like Saudi Arabia and Mexico, but it is also being deployed locally and in some cases against Israeli [phone] numbers -- something which the NSO Group previously claimed was not possible."" In response, NSO Group said: ""Due to contractual and national security considerations, we cannot confirm or deny the identity of our government customers. As we stated in the past, NSO Group does not operate the products itself; the company license approved government agencies to do so, and we are not privy to the details of individuals monitored."" NSO Group says its spyware helps ""law enforcement and intelligence agencies around the world to defend the public from serious crime and terror."" Cybersecurity analysts and human rights activists have long accused NSO Group, in particular, of selling invasive and easy-to-use mobile hacking software to repressive governments.NSO Group's Pegasus spyware is said to have been used to spy on a journalist and activist in Morocco, the widow of a slain Mexican journalist and two women connected to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, among other targets, according to security researchers. US government officials have been concerned by the expansion of the market for hacking tools and the ability of foreign governments to quickly develop their own cyber capabilities using American expertise. In September, for example, the Justice Department announced charges against three former US intelligence and military operatives for allegedly helping build a hacking program for the United Arab Emirates government.",2
312,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi escaped an assassination attempt on Sunday after an explosive-laden drone targeted his residence in Baghdad, the country's military said.Al-Kadhimi went on to Twitter moments after the attack and called for ""calm and restraint from everyone."" ""Thank God, I am fine and among my people,"" he tweeted on his official account.He called the attacks cowardly, saying that they work against a better future for the country.  Al-Kadhimi called for calm and constructive dialogue ""for the sake of Iraq and the future of Iraq.""""I was and still am a redemption project for Iraq and the people of Iraq. The missiles of treachery will not discourage the believers and will shake a hair of the stability and determination of our heroic security forces to preserve people's security, achieve justice and set the law in place,"" he said.Seven of Kadhimi's security personnel were injured, according to Ministry of Interior Spokesman General Saad Maan, speaking to Al-Sharqiya TV.He clarified that only two armed drones were involved in the assassination attempt and that they had been launched from around 12km northeast of Baghdad. One of the drones was shot down by the Iraqi military, Maan said.The Iraqi military said that Al-Kadhimi was unharmed and in good health, and that security forces were ""taking the necessary measures in connection with this failed attempt.""A source close to the Iraqi leader said Sunday that Al-Kadhimi was returning from overseeing security forces engaged in a stand-off with protesters at the southern gate of the Green Zone, the heavily fortified area of Baghdad where the the Prime Minister's residence and other government and diplomatic buildings are located, around the time of the drone attack.The US State Department condemned the ""apparent act of terrorism"" in a statement on Sunday. ""We are in close touch with the Iraqi security forces charged with upholding Iraq's sovereignty and independence and have offered our assistance as they investigate this attack,"" spokesperson Ned Price said.The President of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), the semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq, also released a statement condemning the failed assassination attempt, calling it a ""terrorist act"" that marks a ""dangerous development that threatens security and stability in the country and portends dire consequences.""""I invite everyone to exercise restraint and calm down,"" KRG President Nechirvan Barani in a statement early Sunday.The influential Shia Muslim cleric and head of the powerful Sadrist Movement Moqtada al-Sadr called the incident a ""terrorist act"" that ""returns [Iraq] to a state of chaos to be controlled by non-governmental forces, so that Iraq lives under the pain of riots, violence and terrorism, so that dangers and interventions from outside swept it from here and there.""As a result of the attempt, he said, ""our valiant army and the heroic security forces must take matters into their own hands until Iraq recovers and returns strong.""Al-Sadr and his coalition won more than 70 seats in Iraq's parliamentary elections held two weeks ago, gaining significant numbers since the last elections in 2018, when they won 54 seats.The Arab League, an organization of 22 Middle Eastern and African countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), condemned the ""heinous assassination attempt"" in a statement on Sunday and said that its Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit spoke with al-Khadimi by phone.""Aboul Gheit said that assassination is the means of cowards, and that the perpetrators of this incident wish to drag the country into the furnace of strife, and ignite a spark of civil chaos in the country -- and that Iraq, its people and its leadership are able to overcome this difficult stage with cohesion and national solidarity, and reject terrorism, militia and violence,"" the statement read.The league also stressed that the recent elections ""represented an important shift towards stability in the country"" and  called on all parties to ""respect their results, and to work within the framework of the constitution, the law and the rules of the democratic political game.""No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt, but it comes amid heightened tensions in the capital. On Friday, one person was killed and dozens were wounded after supporters of Iran-backed militias clashed with Iraqi security forces near the Green Zone, health officials told CNN. Parties representing Iran-backed militias called for protests after losing parliament seats during Iraq's elections last month, angering militia leaders and sparking several protests and sit-ins over the past weeks. Kata'ib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iranian-backed Shia militia groups in Iraq, denied any involvement in the assassination attempt on the prime minister on Sunday, while also questioning the government's take on the attack in a statement released by spokesman Abu Ali al-Askari.Al-Askari said that Al-Kadhimi is ""playing the victim,"" adding there are ""less expensive"" and more guaranteed ways to cause harm to the prime minister -- if that were the goal.""Isn't it ironic that he calls for restraint and calm, so who should be worried? Who has lost control of himself?"" al-Askari said in a statement on Sunday.In a no-holds bar jab at the Prime Minister, al-Askari added: ""May God curse you and those who help you.""Meanwhile, the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani condemned the assassination attempt, saying in a tweet on Sunday that the incident must be ""traced back to foreign think tanks (or agencies)"" that have ""brought nothing but insecurity, discord, and instability to the oppressed Iraqi people through the creation and support of terrorist groups and occupation of this country for years.""

313,"Jerusalem (CNN)Sitting next to the Israeli Foreign Minister in Washington this October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was clear: The Americans want to re-open their consulate in Jerusalem to serve Palestinians. ""We'll be moving forward with the process of opening a consulate as part of deepening of those ties with the Palestinians,"" Blinken said at the State Department. Less than a month later, Israel's political leadership was also clear: it has no plans to approve such a consulate (the host country must approve any new foreign consulate). Asked by CNN at a press conference Saturday evening about US intentions, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said his government had presented its opinion to the Americans ""clearly and openly.""  ""There is no room for another American consulate in Jerusalem. We always present our position quietly without drama and we expect it to be understood. Jerusalem is the capital of one state and that's the state of Israel,"" Bennett said, standing alongside Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. ""I'm sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.""  Lapid, who sat next to Blinken as he made those comments in Washington last month, echoed Bennett's sentiments, adding that if the Americans want to open a consulate for Palestinians in Ramallah, they would be welcome to do so.    ""As for the (US) consulate, as we both said it is not about politics and political stability. It is the State of Israel refusing in principle that a consulate be opened in Jerusalem,"" Lapid said. Former President Donald Trump folded the consulate in 2019, merging it into the new American embassy in Jerusalem after moving it from Tel Aviv when the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. For many Palestinians, an American consulate in Jerusalem is a precursor to what they hope will one day be an American Embassy in East Jerusalem, capital of a potential future state of Palestine. The Americans have been seen as largely holding off from major confrontations with Israel over issues like the consulate or the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as a way to help shore up the stability of the coalition government. Stitched together from a diverse group of eight parties representing a broad spectrum of ideologies, the government came to power in June agreeing on few subjects except a desire to oust former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after 12 years in power. Passing a new state budget at the end of last week -- which had not been accomplished since 2018 leading to Israel's record four elections in two years -- puts the government on much more stable ground (because failure to do so by November 14 would have triggered new elections). Now some world partners, including European diplomats like Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, have made it clear that with the new government now looking more secure, it is time to start pushing Israel harder on issues related to the Palestinians.  ""I think that both the EU and the US quite frankly have been cautious in terms of any criticism of this new Israeli government because it is a fragile government,"" Coveney told CNN's Becky Anderson on Thursday. But with the budget passed, and Israel's government looking set, ""both Washington as well as the European Union needs to now focus on their relationship with this new Israeli government, and make it very clear to them that if we are serious about delivering a peace process together, well, then expanding settlements not only is illegal, but it is also unacceptable to the international community,"" he added. Hussein Al Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority's head of Civil Affairs, said in a tweet on Sunday that Bennett's statements about the consulate in Jerusalem represent a ""challenge from the Israeli government to the #Biden administration,"" seeing as it had ""already announced repeatedly its decision to open the US Consulate in East Jerusalem!!!""  While the new Israeli government's mantra in its relations with the United States has been ""no drama,"" especially when it comes to a possible return to the Iran nuclear deal, the Biden administration has openly criticized the Israeli government recently over issues related to the Palestinians. A recent announcement by Israel to green light thousands of new Israeli housing units in the West Bank, was criticized by the State Department, whose spokesperson Ned Price called it ""completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm."" Israel's move to label six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organizations, accusing them of working with the designated terrorist group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, also drew some sharp words from the Europeans and Americans. ""We believe respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and a strong civil society are critically important for responsible and responsive governance,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at the time. But when asked on Saturday if his government was headed toward a confrontation and increased tensions with the Americans, now that the budget had passed, Bennett simply said, ""No."" ""There is so much more we agree upon with American friends that we disagree upon,"" the Prime Minister said, adding "" I am sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.""

314,"An Israeli court suspended on Wednesday the auction of a partial tattoo kit billed as having been used on inmates at the Auschwitz death camp, following an outcry from Holocaust survivors.Obtained from a private collector, the eight fingernail-sized steel dies, each lined with pins to form numerals, would have been pressed into prisoners' flesh with ink to brand their serial numbers, according to auctioneer Meir Tzolman.His website had deemed it ""the most shocking of Holocaust items,"" with a projected sale value of $30,000 to $40,000.Bidding reached $3,400 by Wednesday, when Tel Aviv District Court granted a request by survivors to order the auction halted pending a November 16 hearing on whether it should proceed. Tzolman's website was amended to show the sale had been suspended.More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed at Auschwitz, among a number of camps run by Nazi Germany on occupied Polish soil during World War II. It was the only facility that tattooed inmates.Israel has no law against private sales of Holocaust relics. A court spokesman's statement did not specify the legal basis for Wednesday's injunction.Yad Vashem, the world Holocaust remembrance center in Jerusalem, said it should have possession of items like the auctioned dies.""The trade of these items is morally unacceptable and only encourages the proliferation of counterfeits,"" said Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem.Interviewed before the court injunction, Tzolman said he was the grandson of Holocaust survivors who had been tattooed. He defended the auction -- from which he would take a 25% commission -- as a means of ensuring the dies reached ""the right hands.""""The seller is determined to sell any way necessary,"" he said. ""We received calls from tens of people who want to bid on this item and donate it. Each one noted a name of a different museum related to the Holocaust.""Tzolman said the dies had been certified as having come from Auschwitz. He did not share such documentation with Reuters.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's website says some Auschwitz tattoos were applied by stylus and others using ""a special metal stamp, holding interchangeable numbers made up of needles approximately one centimeter long.""The Auschwitz Memorial in Poland said photographs of the dies appeared similar to those in its collection.""If they would be authentic, then the very fact that such unique historical items are put up for auction -- and not given to an institution that commemorates the victims and educates about the tragedy of Auschwitz -- deserves the words of protest and condemnation,"" said memorial press officer Pawel Sawicki.",2
315,"Expecting a possible siege, pro-government forces in central Yemen are preparing to defend Marib city, their last northern stronghold, against advancing Houthi fighters bent on taking full control of one of Yemen's key energy-producing regions.Should Marib governorate fall to the Houthis it would deal a blow to the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia that has been battling the Iran-aligned group for over six years and to United Nations-led peace efforts.The looming battle for Marib city would also put at risk its population of three million people, including nearly 1 million who fled other parts of Yemen since it became ensnared in a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Houthi military spokesman Yahia Sarea announced on Tuesday they had seized Marib's al-Jubah and Jabal Murad districts, after last month taking al-Abdiyah and Harib, saying ""our mujahideen continue the march towards Marib city.""They have advanced on most districts in Marib, Yemen's only gas-producing region and home to one of the country's largest oilfields in Marib Al Wadi, which along with Marib city remain fully under government control.It is not clear if the Houthis will launch a direct assault on the capital of Marib governorate or move to take the nearby oil and gas facilities and besiege the city.Their territorial gains in Marib as well as in oil-rich Shabwa in the south, come despite coalition airstrikes and fierce battles that have exacted a heavy toll on both sides, but also killed civilians.""Houthi control of all of Marib looks only a matter of time though it could take several months, unless government forces receive better quality weapons from the coalition and overcome differences amongst them,"" said Maysaa Shuja Al-Deen, a fellow at the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies.Government forces say they will not cede. Trenches, sand bags and land mines are in place around the city, two military sources and a local official said.""If the Houthis move through the desert towards oil and gas fields east of Marib city they will be easy prey for coalition warplanes, so they will try to encircle the city from three fronts, but we can withstand and break them,"" a military commander, who declined to be named, told Reuters.Marib lies east of the capital Sanaa, which the Houthis seized along with most of north Yemen in 2014 when they ousted the Saudi-backed government, prompting the coalition to intervene only to become mired in a military stalemate.The United Nations and United States have struggled to engineer a truce needed to revive political talks to end a war that has killed tens of thousands and left millions hungry.""Our immediate concern is about the safety and protection of civilians in Marib. In just the first six months of this year, more civilians there were killed or wounded than in the previous two years combined,"" said Erin Hutchinson, Norwegian Refugee Council's country director in Yemen.Talks between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran aimed at easing tensions have made little progress and the Houthi advance in Marib is likely to further embolden Tehran. The two foes have for years vied for control across the region.""From an Iranian perspective, their ally in Yemen the Houthis appear very close in effect to winning the war in the north, if not the entire country. It is extremely difficult to understand why they or the Houthis would feel this is the right moment to stop,"" said Peter Salisbury, a senior analyst at International Crisis Group.Riyadh, which wants to exit a costly war but needs security guarantees including over Houthi missiles that have targeted Saudi cities, has seen power shift to the Houthis since 2019, when ally the United Arab Emirates largely wound down its presence.""The Saudis...will not leave (Yemen) at any cost, they need to present their intervention as somewhat successful,"" Salisbury said.Even if Riyadh reaches a deal with the Houthis, ending the war requires agreement among Yemen's myriad factions.""Is it possible to work towards an internally coherent settlement? It's just a lot of moving parts,"" he said.",2

Of course, I accepted and hopefully, it won't happen again,"" Elharrar said to CNN's Max Foster during an interview in Glasgow on Tuesday.When asked who she thought was responsible for the issue, Elharrar, who suffers from muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair, said she didn't want to judge. ""I just encountered a problem.""""Instead of dealing with green energy, with collaborations between countries in order to fight the climate change, I promoted accessibility,"" she continued.""I'm not for apologies. I just want for the next time, nothing like that to happen.""Johnson asked Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to invite Elharrar to join them in a meeting Tuesday. The UK leader personally apologized to Elharrar for the incident the previous day, according to a senior official with the Israeli delegation at COP.Elharrar traveled to the COP venue in Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's motorcade on Tuesday and accompanied him into the conference, the official said.Bennett sharply criticized COP26 organizers for the access issue, and had threatened to cancel his appearance at the event Tuesday.COP26 President Alok Sharma has repeatedly said that a fully inclusive conference was critical to the success of the climate conference.CNN has reached out to the UK Prime Minister's office for comment.According to an official traveling with Bennett's delegation to Scotland, Israeli officials spent two hours trying to get Elharrar into the COP venue Monday but ""due to it not being fully wheelchair accessible, the efforts were unsuccessful and the Minister could not enter.""   Israel's Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who is not part of the delegation, tweeted, ""it is impossible to safeguard our future and address the climate crisis, without first and foremost caring for people, including ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities.""  Britain's Ambassador in Tel Aviv, Neil Wigan, was quick to say sorry.  ""I am disturbed to hear that [Karine Elharrar] was unable to attend meetings at COP26. I apologise deeply and sincerely to the Minister. We want a COP Summit that is welcoming and inclusive to everyone,"" he tweeted. The United Nations climate change body later apologized for ""inconveniences associated with accessing the venue of COP26, both physically and virtually, in an email distributed to COP26 participants on Tuesday.The UN Climate Change secretariat added that ""COP26 is taking place under exceptional and unprecedented logistical circumstances"" and that access to many spaces had to be reduced to comply with Covid-19 protocols in maintaining social distancing. With over 38,000 registered attendees, social distancing at the conference has proven difficult. An ""unprecedented interest"" in this particular COP, and the security arrangements of the World Leaders Summit, has ""added to the many logistical pressures,"" the statement continued to explain. ""In many ways, the first few days of the COP26 have been a learning process, with participants and staff getting used to the pandemic-related logistical measures and circumstances, and we are doing our utmost to continuously learn and adapt.""",2
317,"Jerusalem  (CNN)Seven Palestinian families facing the threat of forced eviction from their homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah have rejected a proposal from Israel's High Court that justices said could resolve the decades-long dispute. The court asked the families to submit their response by Tuesday to a plan that would see them offered protected tenancy status for 15 years in exchange for accepting -- via a rental payment of 2,400 shekels ($750) per year -- that the land belongs to Nahalat Shimon Limited, a Jewish settler organization seeking to develop the area for Jewish housing. Announcing their position at a press conference in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, family members said the court proposal was a means of temporarily delaying plans to remove them from their homes and confiscate land. The families have been living in Sheikh Jarrah since the 1950s after fleeing homes the previous decade in Haifa, Jaffa and other towns which became part of the state of Israel. They say their situation is unfair because they are not able to reclaim those original homes, while standing to lose residences for which they gave up their refugee status more than 60 years ago. Tensions in the neighborhood rose earlier this year when it appeared the case was coming to a conclusion, and which Hamas used in part as a pretext for firing rockets at Jerusalem, triggering an 11-day war between Gaza militants and the Israeli army. A Hamas-linked organization had made clear its opposition to the High Court proposal, writing in a letter to one of the lawyers involved that they had a ""national, moral and legal responsibility"" to reject it. Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority, also said it had ""clearly informed the families and their lawyers that we are categorically against the proposal, and we will stand by them and will not allow them to be thrown into the street."" But family members denied that they had taken their decision under duress, saying they had reached it independently. There has been no response from the High Court, but justices have previously said that if their proposal was rejected they would issue a binding decision at some point. ",2
318,"A Houthi ballistic missile attack on a mosque and a religious school killed and injured 29 civilians, including women and children, in the Yemeni province of Marib, the country's information minister said in a statement on Twitter on Monday.Two ballistic missiles were used in the attack late on Sunday, Marib governor's office said in a statement.There was no immediate claim of responsibility by the Iranian-backed Houthis.Fighting between government forces and Houthis has escalated in recent months. The United Nations says some 10,000 people were displaced in September by fighting in Marib, the internationally recognized government's last northern stronghold. It is calling for a humanitarian corridor for aid.The war in Yemen and ensuring economic collapse as well as restrictions on imports to Houthi-held areas have caused what the United Nations says is the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 16 million people facing starvation.A coalition of forces led by Riyadh intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from the capital Sanaa in late 2014. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.The Houthi movement said in October they had seized new territory in the energy-rich provinces of Shabwa and Marib, gains confirmed by sources, as it presses an offensive likely to further complicate international peace efforts.",2
319," (CNN)Israel's plan to greenlight thousands of new Israeli housing units in the West Bank is drawing outcry from the US, UK and a dozen European countries.The government of Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett earlier this week published immediate tenders for more than 1,300 housing units to be built in the West Bank, where it is also pushing plans for a further 3,000 homes for Jewish settlers there.Under international law, both the West Bank and East Jerusalem are considered occupied territory and settlements there illegal, which Israel disputes.On Thursday, twelve European countries urged Israel to ""reverse its decision"" in a joint statement.""We urge the Government of Israel to reverse its decision to advance plans for the construction of around 3,000 settlement units in the West Bank. We reiterate our strong opposition to its policy of settlement expansion across the Occupied Palestinian Territories, which violates international law and undermines efforts for the two-state solution,"" read the statement from the foreign ministries of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. James Cleverly, the UK's Minister for the Middle East and North Africa echoed the sentiment in a separate statement, adding that ""settlements are illegal under international law and present an obstacle to peace and stability.""The Israeli announcement had already drawn the ire of the US State Department, with spokesman Ned Price criticizing the move on Tuesday as ""completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm.""The Biden administration ""strongly oppose[s] the expansion of settlements,"" Price said.The move is likely to put a fresh wrinkle in relations between the Biden administration and the Bennett government, though Israel hopes to soothe tensions soon with an expected decision to green-light more than one thousand new homes for Palestinians in the West Bank.The timing of the announcement is also being criticized at home by left and center-left parties in Israel's governing coalition, another sign of strains in Bennett's government.According to Israeli settlement monitoring group Peace Now, there are more than 270 settlements in the West Bank and at least 450,000 Israelis living there.",2

However, Washington said last month that it was working on contingency plans if Iran continues to make nuclear advances and fails to return to negotiations.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned earlier this month that the window for diplomacy with Tehran was closing. ""I'm not going to put a specific date on it, but with every passing day and Iran's refusal to engage in good faith, the runway gets shortened,"" Blinken said.During a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in September, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi insisted that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons, that the US is at fault for leaving the nuclear deal, and emphasized that the US has to meet its obligations under the deal first, by lifting sanctions.",2
321," (CNN)The daughter of a former top Saudi intelligence official has told CNN that representatives of the Saudi government attempted to lure her to the same consulate where Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in Istanbul, as part of a series of threats against her and her family.Hissah Al-Muzaini, the daughter of former Saudi official Saad Aljabri, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday that the kingdom encouraged her to go to the ""consulate in Istanbul. They tried to encourage me to go there.""""I'm lucky I didn't go or else my kids wouldn't have a mum and dad,"" she said. Al-Muzaini's family has previously made this allegation in a civil suit filed earlier this year.  According to the suit, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ""attempted to lure Dr. Saad's daughter, Hissah Al-Muzaini to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul."" At the time of writing, the Saudi government had not responded to CNN's request for comment on the claim.Her father Saad Aljabri is currently waging a civil lawsuit in Washington, DC, alleging that bin Salman, also known as MBS, sent a hit team to target him in Canada where he and his daughter live in exile, and that the men involved were intercepted and deported by authorities at Ottawa's international airport.In a CBS interview aired Sunday, Aljabri -- who had previously served as an adviser to former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef before he was deposed in 2017 -- repeated those allegations against Mohammed Bin Salman Al Saud, the now de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, and claimed that he has wrongly imprisoned two of Aljabri's children, Sarah and Omar, in Saudi Arabia.Aljabri's two adult children were convicted of money laundering and attempting to escape, and sentenced to prison in what Human Rights Watch called an ""unfair"" trial that was ""an apparent effort to coerce"" Aljabri to return to Saudi Arabia.Speaking to Amanpour, Al-Muzaini reiterated her father's allegations and also claimed that her husband has been abducted. ""We've been living a real-life nightmare for the past four years,"" she said. ""Imagine yourself, your dad has been targeted with hit squads, your siblings (have been) imprisoned and accused of things they've never done ... your husband being imprisoned, kidnapped and then tortured.""Al-Muzaini's husband, Salem, was arrested last year, according to Reuters. Al-Muzaini told Amanpour that her husband had previously been ""forced under torture to sign off all his assets and wealth in order for his freedom"" after being detained in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton in 2017. MBS had detained around 200 Saudi royals, officials and business executives in the name of an anti-corruption campaign at the time.The current treatment of her husband and siblings was part of what Al-Muzaini described as a ""personal vendetta that MBS has"" against her father. Referring to bin Salman, she said he ""fears ... what my dad knows,"" and that the information her father has may present a barrier between bin Salman and the throne.""We live in fear. We always look over our shoulder. We don't feel safe. I don't know how we can feel safe when people like this are chasing family members and sending hit squads and killing people in embassies and consulates.""CNN has repeatedly reached out to the Saudi Embassy in Washington and the Saudi Foreign Ministry regarding Al-Muzaini's claims but no one was available to comment at the time of writing.In a statement provided to CBS, the Saudis denied the allegations and called Aljabri ""a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed, which amount to billions of dollars, to furnish a lavish life-style for himself and his family.""In January, a number of Saudi state-owned companies alleged in a counter lawsuit in Canada that Aljabri had embezzled billions of dollars while he served as a government official. A Canadian court -- citing evidence of fraud -- has subsequently frozen Aljabri's assets. When pressed on this development, Al-Muzaini said ""my dad denied all the allegations and the lawsuit is still ongoing.""""I'm a proud daughter and what I know is the method that they are taking by involving family members, kidnapping, torturing, imprisoning, is not the right way that governments should act. That's what I know,"" she said.Al-Muzaini was speaking to Amanpour from Washington and made a public appeal to President Joe Biden ""to intervene and help us save and reunite our family.""""We will only feel safe when MBS has been prevented from doing what he's doing,"" she added.",2
322," (CNN)Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is a ""psychopath,"" who ""poses a threat to his people, to the Americans and to the planet,"" a former top Saudi intelligence official who is now living in exile in Canada has said. In an interview on CBS News program ""60 Minutes,"" which aired Sunday, Saad Aljabri described watching a video recording of a meeting that he alleged took place in 2014 between MBS and his cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef (MBN), who was then Saudi Arabia's head of intelligence. ""He [MBS] told him [MBN], I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get a poison ring from Russia. It's enough for me just to shake hands with him and he will be done,"" Aljabri said. ""That what he say. Whether he's just bragging or, but he said that and we took it seriously.""The crown prince's father, King Salman, ascended to the throne in January 2015 after his half brother, King Abdullah, died at age 90.MBS became crown prince following a power struggle with his cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, who was deposed and has been under house arrest since June 2017. Aljabri worked closely with MBN for years as the kingdom's number two intelligence official. During the interview, Aljabri also repeated allegations that MBS, the young de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, plotted to send a hit squad to murder him in Canada three years ago, and has imprisoned two of Aljabri's children, Sarah and Omar, in Saudi Arabia.Aljabri told CBS he was warned in 2018 that a Saudi hit team was heading to Canada to kill him. He said the warning came days after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Aljabri says he was told, ""... don't be in a proximity of any Saudi mission in Canada. Don't go to the consulate. Don't go to the embassy. I said why? Said, they dismembered the guy, they kill him. You are on the top of the list.""The alleged murder plot has been reported on before.In a statement to ""60 Minutes,"" a Canadian government spokesperson said, ""While we cannot comment on specific allegations currently before the courts, we are aware of incidents in which foreign actors have attempted to monitor, intimidate or threaten Canadians and those living in Canada.""CBS says Saudi Arabia declined an interview, but the kingdom's embassy in Washington issued a statement, describing Aljabri as a ""discredited"" former government official.""Saad Aljabri is a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed, which amount to billions of dollars, to furnish a lavish life-style for himself and his family,"" the statement read. ""He has not denied his crimes; in fact, he implies that stealing was acceptable at the time. But it wasn't acceptable nor legal then, and it isn't now.""A group of Saudi companies owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, which the prince controls, are suing Aljabri in the US and Canada, claiming he stole money from the counterterrorism budget. Aljabri denied those claims in the interview.He says he's speaking out now for his two children who are imprisoned in Saudi Arabia, saying, ""I am appealing to the American people and to the American administration to help me to release those children and to restore their life.""

323," (CNN)An event introducing a newly appointed Iranian governor was dramatically interrupted Saturday after a man walked on stage and slapped him in the face. Zeinolabedin Khorram, the new governor of East Azerbaijan province, was on stage delivering a speech at the Imam Khomeini Mosque in the northeastern city of Tabriz when the incident took place. A video posted online by Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency shows a man calmly walking up to Khorram, slapping him in the face and then shoving him. Security guards can then be seen running toward the offender and pulling him off stage. It was a rare breach of security in Iran -- the event was attended by the country's Interior Minister, representatives of Ayatollah Khamenei's office and other state officials.The semi-official news agency Tasnim identified the offender as Ayoub Alizadeh, a member of the country's armed forces.In an interview with state-run television IRIB, the provincial governor said he did not know the offender personally. The motive for the attack is unclear. According to Khorram, the offender told the police after he was arrested that he slapped him because he was upset that a man had vaccinated his wife at a Covid-19 vaccine clinic, rather than a woman, IRIB said in its report.Another report said the attack was not political. When asked about the incident in parliament on Saturday, Ali Alizadeh, a representative from Maragheh, a city in East Azerbaijan province, said ""certainly, this person's motive was personal and it had nothing to do with the appointment of the governor or even his words.""",2

The Crown Prince added Saudi Arabia will plant more than 450 million trees as part of the first phase of afforestation initiatives and rehabilitate degraded lands to increase protected areas in the kingdom to more than 20%, the Saudi Press Agency reported.The crown prince also said Saudi Arabia will be transforming Riyadh into ""one of the world's most sustainable cities.""The Saudi Green Initiative forum is held in Riyadh Saturday to bring together companies, international NGOs, and ministers of environment and climate ahead of COP26 talks October 31-November 12 at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.Prince Charles delivered a keynote speech at the forum, warning in a virtual address there is a ""dangerously narrow window"" to accelerate the global ""green recovery,"" adding the international community must mobilize to lay the foundations for a sustainable future.Saudi Arabia's efforts ""in energy transition is critically important,"" he said.""I can only say that it is enormously encouraging to see the commitment to diversifying its energy mix, recognizing the cascading economic, social, and environmental benefits that renewable energy provides,"" Prince Charles added.",2
325," (CNN)Syria has executed 24 people who were convicted of terrorism charges for igniting last year's devastating wildfires that left 3 people dead and scorched thousands of acres of forests, the Syrian Ministry of Justice said Thursday.The perpetrators confessed that they had set fire to several locations in the three governorates, and were first arrested last year, the Ministry of Justice statement said. They were executed on Wednesday.Eleven other people involved in setting the wildfires were given life sentences of hard labor, with four others sentenced to temporary hard labor, the statement said. Five minors were also given jail sentences ranging from 10 to 12 years for their involvement.The fires affected 280 towns, damaged more than 370 homes and destroyed 11,000 hectares of forested land, with significant damage also caused to livestock, agricultural equipment and infrastructure, according to the Ministry of Justice. The fires spread across the provinces of Latakia, Tartous and Homs.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a rare visit to areas hit by the wildfires last October, Reuters reported, citing the official SANA news agency. Assad's hometown of Qardaha, in Latakia province, was badly hit by the blaze.The Ministry of Justice statement said that the perpetrators admitted to planning to set the fires at the end of August 2020 and that they carried out the crimes ""intermittently"" from September until October 2020. Capital punishment in Syria is permissible in the case of crimes including treason, espionage, murder and arson. In 2017, Amnesty International shed a light on a campaign of mass hangings in Saydnaya Prison, located north of the capital Damascus. The Amnesty report, ""Human Slaughterhouse"" found that 13,000 people had been executed the prison, in a ""hidden"" campaign authorized by senior regime figures. The report alleges that prisoners were moved in the middle of the night from their cells under the pretext of being transferred, but instead, were taken to the grounds of the prison, where they were hanged.The Ministry of Justice refuted the accusations.",2

327," (CNN)Marvel might have reached into its quiver once too often with ""Hawkeye,"" at least based on the first two episodes, which offer a slow start tilted more toward the character of Kate Bishop than the titular Clint Barton. Amusing in places, this holiday-themed series makes jokes about trick arrows, but it's going to need a few more tricks up its sleeve.The premiere finds Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) in New York City with his kids, leaving his beyond-patient wife (Linda Cardellini) behind. But the early focus is on the young Kate (Hailee Steinfeld) and her origin story, having lost her dad and -- inspired by Hawkeye's example -- committed herself to mastering combat and archery, which fairly quickly comes in handy.Kate essentially stumbles onto a strange conspiracy, and in the process runs across an artifact that's destined to catch Clint's attention. He's understandably cranky, however, about getting drawn into a mystery that will keep him in New York, threatening the family time for which he's been hoping with Christmas only a few days away.As with ""WandaVision"" and ""Loki,"" ""Hawkeye"" cleverly calls back to earlier moments in the Marvel universe and exhibits no great hurry to disgorge secrets, including what the true danger might be. Fans also get to see a bit more of Renner (pulling series double duty right now in ""Mayor of Kingstown"") as the hero in family-man mode, a wrinkle seemingly made for a series format.As initially lined up, though, the battles the pair face involve a particularly tired bunch of miscreants. Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly.So what's left? One genuinely laugh-out-loud funny gag in the first episode, and the interplay between the curmudgeonly Clint and the enthusiastic Kate, with Steinfeld well-chosen for some sort of baton (or arrow) pass, but moderately fleshed out as a character in the early going.Beyond entering the world of superheroes, Kate's issues also include her mom (Vera Farmiga, underused at first) having entered into a new relationship with Jack (""Better Call Saul's"" Tony Dalton), who provokes Kate's suspicions.Marvel's series for Disney+ have cleverly used the platform to more fully explore established characters while simultaneously planting seedlings for future offshoots -- a logical strategy for all sorts of reasons, which has allowed the studio to experiment with different kinds of shows. That's certainly cheaper than jumping directly into something like ""Eternals"" on the big screen.While not employed thus far, the ""Hawkeye"" trailer does reveal that there will be trick arrows before it's over. Yet unless that arsenal significantly improves the show's payload, the guy who once said he couldn't miss might rather ironically be associated with a Marvel series that conspicuously does.""Hawkeye"" premieres Nov. 24 on Disney+.",2
328," (CNN)Kevin Hart stays close to his comfort zone in one respect in ""True Story"" -- playing a wealthy and famous comedian -- while stretching in another, in a dark drama of cascading stakes and consequences. Also producing the Netflix limited series with ""Narcos'"" Eric Newman, Hart delivers a crisp and compelling drama that, at seven episodes, avoids the mistake of prolonging the act beyond its weight.The series notably follows another dramatic role by Hart for Netflix, the movie ""Fatherhood,"" a much softer exercise.Here, he plays Kid, who comes to play in his hometown of Philadelphia, where a night out with his support-hungry brother Carlton (Wesley Snipes) triggers a major crisis, forcing him to engage his brother's help to clean up the mess, while being drawn into the orbit of some very, very bad people.Kid is also juggling high-profile movie roles, but his off-screen performance to appear cool and collected under these trying circumstances is a little hit-miss, with his agitated behavior unsettling his manager (Paul Adelstein) and causing friction among those around him. Much of the kick in ""True Story"" involves seeing the world through Hart's eyes, or at least the equivalent of them, as someone who is under constant scrutiny but receives plenty of benefits, all while dealing with adoring fans, one of whom (well played by ""Sons of Anarchy's"" Theo Rossi) figures prominently in the plot.Yet ""True Story"" mostly works as a pass-the-popcorn affair, where each apparent escape from the hangman's noose yields an unexpected twist that drags the comedian further into this nightmare, threatening the career he has struggled to build, and revealing how far he'll go to protect that.Indeed, if Kid seems miscast for this world of true crime, as he says at one point regarding his stardom, ""They don't know what I did to get here.""The story also zeroes in on the tension between the two brothers, with Kid having bailed Carlton out in the past, but now more prone to rely upon him under these extraordinary circumstances. ""I got this,"" Carlton reassures him.Streaming has become an ideal platform for stars like Hart to explore other creative avenues without having to fret about opening-weekend concerns.""True Story"" achieves a delicate balance, providing a kind-of glimpse behind the central character's (and by extension Hart's) velvet-roped existence while taking on its own life as a solid thriller that tells a tight, self-contained story.While nobody would want another season of that -- after all, how unlucky could one guy be? -- it is the kind of polished production that as Hart spreads his dramatic wings makes you eager to see what he'll do for an encore.""True Story"" premieres Nov. 24 on Netflix.",2
329," (CNN)Jennifer Lawrence has revealed that she is ""nervous"" about returning to the spotlight after taking a step back when she felt ""everybody had gotten sick of me.""The Oscar winner spoke to Vanity Fair magazine for its December issue cover story in a wide-ranging interview, touching on the challenges of fame, a near-death experience, the trauma of having intimate photos leaked online and the gender pay gap.Lawrence, who is expecting a baby with husband Cooke Maroney, is due to make her return to the screen with Adam McKay's comedy ""Don't Look Up.""Speaking to Vanity Fair, the 31-year-old star said: ""I'm so nervous... I haven't spoken to the world in forever. And to come back now, when I have all of these new accessories added to my life that I obviously want to protect.""The interview touches on the movies Lawrence worked on before she took a step back from the spotlight, which included ""Passengers,"" ""Mother!"" ""Red Sparrow"" and ""Dark Phoenix.""""I was not pumping out the quality that I should have,"" she said. ""I just think everybody had gotten sick of me. I'd gotten sick of me.""Lawrence said she had started to think she couldn't do anything right.""If I walked a red carpet, it was, 'Why didn't she run?'... I think that I was people-pleasing for the majority of my life,"" she said.Now Lawrence is pregnant and, although she declined to talk about how she feels about becoming a mother, she did share her thoughts on protecting her child.""Every instinct in my body wants to protect their privacy for the rest of their lives, as much as I can. I don't want anyone to feel welcome into their existence. And I feel like that just starts with not including them in this part of my work,"" she said. In 2014, a hacker leaked nude photos of Lawrence and other female celebrities. The actress spoke about the impact this has had on her.""Anybody can go look at my naked body without my consent, any time of the day,"" she said. ""Somebody in France just published them. My trauma will exist forever.""She also recounted an experience from 2017 when a small private plane she was traveling on had to make a hard emergency landing after both of its engines failed.""Flying is horrific and I have to do it all the time,"" she said, explaining how she had started leaving ""little mental voicemails"" to her family as the plane hurtled towards the ground.Lawrence, previously named the world's highest-paid actress, also touched on the reported pay discrepancy between her and ""Don't Look Up"" co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. ""Look, Leo brings in more box office than I do. I'm extremely fortunate and happy with my deal. But in other situations, what I have seen -- and I'm sure other women in the workforce have seen as well -- is that it's extremely uncomfortable to inquire about equal pay,"" she said. ""And if you do question something that appears unequal, you're told it's not gender disparity but they can't tell you what exactly it is.""The film airs on Netflix next month and CNN has reached out to the streaming service for comment.Read the full cover story ""A Happy New Year"" by Karen Valby in Vanity Fair's December issue and on VanityFair.com.",2

333," (CNN)Sandra Bullock has shared the big screen with Keanu Reeves twice -- but she's down for a third and even has an idea. Speaking to Esquire magazine for a profile on her ""Speed"" co-star, Bullock said she'd ""love nothing more than to do a comedy with Keanu before we both die."" (Grim, but OK.) ""He's funny. We can be seventy-five—it'll be even better then, like an old-people 'Cocoon' thing,"" she told the publication. ""We play two funny old people. A road trip. Just put us in an RV as old people.

(In 2006, they'd star together again in ""The Lake House."") Though they were never romantically involved, she said, Reeves was and remains and uniquely thoughtful person. She told one story about offhandedly mentioning in a conversation with Reeves that'd she'd never had Champagne and truffles, only to have him show up at her door days later with flowers, Champagne and truffles. ""That's what I mean that it drives you crazy,"" Bullock told the magazine. ""When I first met him, I would spend as much time as I could filling a silence, just to feel comfortable. And the more I jibber-jabbered on, the quieter he would get. And I thought, I don't understand what's happening! He's looking at me with eyes of confusion. He's quiet. Did I say something to offend him? And then a day or two later, he would arrive with a note or a little package, saying, 'I thought about what you said.'

334," (CNN)""House of Gucci"" takes a seemingly can't-miss combination of talent and material and produces what feels like the knockoff version of a really grand drama. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver bring buzz to director Ridley Scott's dive into the dysfunctional family behind the fashion empire, but in a movie that doesn't rise to the level of delicious trash, winding up largely defined by its stylish accessories.Based on a book and covering nearly two decades from the late '70s into the mid-'90s, the film hinges on the relationship between Gaga's Patrizia and Driver's Maurizio Gucci. The heir was at first disowned by his father (Jeremy Irons) for marrying a lower-class girl, before being wooed back into the fold by his colorful uncle Aldo (Al Pacino), who sees Maurizio as having more potential to lead the family business than his foppish son, Paolo (Jared Leto, under the most unflattering makeup since Tom Cruise suited up for ""Tropic Thunder"").The story begins briskly enough, as Patrizia clearly sets her sights on Maurizio, making his father's suspicions that she's ""after your money, like they all are"" appear not all that far-fetched.Once together, he's happy as an outcast but she yearns for more, pressuring him to get back into the family's good graces and eventually to push for greater control at the expense of his relatives, despite frequent reminders that her claim to the ""Gucci"" name comes by marriage, not blood.""It's time to take out the trash,"" Patrizia says, in one of those lines seemingly written for use in the coming attractions.It's a very age-old story, but one that takes unexpected turns as the money rolls in, and the authorities take notice of the family's finances.Still, other than Leto's over-the-top, scenery-chewing performance ""House of Gucci"" really doesn't go the extra mile to stress the absurdity of it all, which makes the whole exercise at times feel more like a slightly bloated, inordinately star-studded Lifetime movie than either of the two obvious alternatives -- namely, a Coen brothers-esque farce, or a truly gripping tale of lust and greed.Instead, this old ""House"" can be enjoyed for the toothiness of its performances (although the accents, Driver's foremost, take a little getting used to) and the soapy situations without feeling like the attraction this mix of marquee names in front of and behind the camera was intended to yield.After her breakout work in ""A Star is Born,"" Gaga demonstrates she's not just a one-trick pony, capturing Patrizia's avarice and allure, which causes her father's male employees to simultaneously applaud and issue catcalls when she saunters into his business. As for Driver, his unusual year has included the bizarre musical ""Annette"" and period drama ""The Last Duel"" (also with Scott directing), reflecting just how in-demand the actor is without fully bolstering the case as to why.Certainly, the detailed touches that went into the movie's look and sound prove impeccable, from the disco music in the early going (you might walk out humming Donna Summer tunes) to the flashy fashions and runway shows.Go in with the right attitude, in other words, and ""House of Gucci"" can still be a good deal of fun. It's just that despite all its extravagant furnishings, it's built on a shaky foundation.""House of Gucci"" premieres Wednesday, Nov. 24 in US theaters. It's rated R.",2
335," (CNN)Eddie Redmayne has addressed the controversy surrounding his Oscar-nominated role in ""The Danish Girl,"" calling his decision to play transgender pioneer Lili Elbe in the 2015 drama a ""mistake.""  The ""Fantastic Beasts"" star, who is preparing for a new West End production of ""Cabaret,"" was speaking to UK publication the Sunday Times. ""The Danish Girl,"" directed by Tom Hooper, is inspired by the story of Elbe, one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Although Redmayne was nominated for a string of awards for his performance, his casting as Elbe  prompted complaints, with many critics arguing that the role should have gone to a trans actor.At the time, trans writer Carol Grant described his casting as ""regressive, reductive, and contributes to harmful stereotypes."" She said: ""What should've been a celebration of a very complex, compelling transgender figure is instead transmisogynist, and just plain-old misogynist in general."" In his interview with the Sunday Times, Redmayne said the criticism was justified, admitting that while he had the best intentions, taking the role was a ""mistake"" and he wouldn't accept it if it were offered today. ""No, I wouldn't take it on now,"" the 39-year-old star said, adding: ""The bigger discussion about the frustrations around casting is because many people don't have a chair at the table. There must be a levelling, otherwise we are going to carry on having these debates."" Redmayne can next be seen playing the Emcee in ""Cabaret,"" opposite ""Chernobyl"" actress Jessie Buckley as Sally Bowles. Liza Minelli famously played Bowles and Joel Grey was cast as the sexually ambiguous Emcee in the 1972 film adaptation Redmayne asked those who might criticize his decision to take on a role often played by LGBT actors to suspend judgment. ""Of all the characters I've ever read, this one defies pigeonholing. I would ask people to come and see it before casting judgment,"" he said. ""Cabaret"" opens opens at London's Playhouse Theatre on December 12.",2
336," (CNN)An arbitrator has ordered Kevin Spacey to pay almost $31 million to Media Rights Capital, the production company behind ""House of Cards,"" the Netflix series in which the actor starred for five seasons until he was fired in 2017.The revelation came in a petition filed Monday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, in which MRC is asking the court ""to confirm the award in its favor and enter judgment against Spacey and his loan-out and producing companies.""Spacey and MRC have been battling in the years since the actor was dismissed from the production over allegations of misconduct on and off the set.In its filing, MRC states that in October of 2020, an arbitrator found Spacey ""repeatedly breached his contractual obligations"" while starring as Frank Underwood on the Emmy-winning show and that his behavior ""rendered him (and his affiliated entities) liable"" for the millions of dollars lost by MRC.  MRC says the company suspended Spacey following CNN's report in 2017, in which several current and former members of the ""House of Cards"" production staff came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. One person also accused Spacey, who was an executive producer on the series, of sexual assault. ""MRC had no knowledge whatsoever of any such conduct by Spacey with any cast or crew associated with the Show,"" the filing states. Shortly before CNN's report, actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed News that the actor made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986 when he was 14 years old. MRC says it halted the production ""to address any concerns of the show's cast and crew"" in wake of the allegations, according to the filing. Following Rapp's claims, Spacey issued a statement claiming he did not recall the incident and apologized for what he said would have been ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""After Spacey was terminated, the petition says that MRC had to ""rewrite the entire season to omit Spacey's character, and to shorten Season 6 from 13 to 8 episodes to meet delivery deadlines"" and suffered monetary losses as a result.Following the arbitrator's decision, MRC released a statement on the ruling, ""The safety of our employees, sets and work environments is of paramount importance to MRC and why we set out to push for accountability.""

342," (CNN)Adele is known for moving fans to tears with her music, but the Grammy award-winning singer shed some of her own after a surprise reunion with a former high school teacher.  The emotional moment happened during the British powerhouse's ITV concert special, ""An Audience with Adele,"" which aired in the UK on Sunday night. During the pre-recorded concert, the pop superstar took a question from Hollywood actress Emma Thompson, who asked whether there was anyone in her past who had supported her, inspired her or protected her from life's trials and tribulations.  In response, Adele opened up about the impact Ms. McDonald, her English teacher at Chestnut Grove Academy, had had on her. The London-born singer shared: ""I had a teacher at (south London high school) Chestnut Grove, who taught me English. That was Miss McDonald... She got me really into English literature. Like, I've always been obsessed with English and obviously now I write lyrics."" ""She was so bloody cool. So engaging,"" Adele added, recalling that McDonald often wore sequins and gold bracelets. ""She really made us care, and we knew that she cared about us."" Thompson then revealed that McDonald, whom Adele hadn't seen in 20 years, was in the audience. It was time for the singer, who is used to surprising fans at her concerts, to be left stunned. In the clip shared on ITV's Twitter account from the highly anticipated televised UK concert special, Adele embraced her former mentor after she was brought on stage. ""I'm so proud of you,"" McDonald said as Adele cried tears of joy. During their exchange, the ""Easy On Me"" hitmaker told McDonald: ""You really did change my life.""  ""Now, I've got to get my whole face re-done,"" the 33-year-old star joked while wiping away tears. She then called on host Alan Carr to step in and entertain the audience with a song while she stepped away to regain her composure After the special aired, Adele took to Twitter to share her excitement at the reunion.  ""Home Sweet Home. I've always dreamt of doing An Audience With..."" she wrote alongside a series of pictures from the TV special, adding: ""There was so much love in the room for each other, it felt like such a gig! Everyone was raucous and bang up for it! And my teacher Ms McDonald was there, it was just heaven.""

347," (CNN)Stage parents seldom fare well in movies and TV, but ""King Richard"" bucks that trend, placing Will Smith on center court in an overwhelmingly flattering portrait of tennis patriarch Richard Williams. Smith aces the performance, which is the main attribute in elevating the story above the standard sports-movie conventions.The film actually follows a fairly concentrated stretch in the formative years of Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams (Demi Singleton) under the watchful eye and tutelage of their father Richard, who speaks frequently of the 78-page plan he mapped out for conquering the nearly all-White tennis world before they were old enough to hold a racquet.""I'm in the champion-raising business,"" Williams announces as he makes the rounds looking for a coach, met with dismissive and vaguely racist replies, including ""You ever think about basketball?""Williams can be imperious (hence the title) and overbearing, much to the occasional chagrin of his daughters and wife (Aunjanue Ellis), who is no wallflower when it comes to the coaching chores or speaking her mind.The portrait that emerges from director Reinaldo Marcus Green and writer Zach Baylin consistently paints him as a heroic figure, protecting his daughters from dangers in the community, stressing their education as well as their ground strokes and working tirelessly to advance their careers, perusing tennis magazines while holding down a job as a night watchman.Any excesses, such as having the girls practice in a pouring rain, are filtered through that prism. And obviously, Williams' determination to ""stick to the plan"" paid off handsomely, despite the irritation and exasperation of tennis coaches (the most prominent played by Tony Goldwyn and Jon Bernthal) riled by his refusal to follow the customary script, including his decision to pull Venus out of juniors tournaments.Smith not only captures the cadence of Williams' voice but the unwavering confidence that he embodied, absolutely convinced that he knew what was best for his girls. It's down the movie's final stretch, as those plans begin to bear fruit, that ""King Richard"" feels more and more conventional, from the stirring music to the questions of how and when to cash in on Venus' prowess while the younger Serena is left behind, but as we all know, not for long.Smith (who also produced the film) is receiving a vigorous push for awards consideration, and he certainly nails the role in a way that belongs in that conversation, even if the movie as a whole seems unlikely to join him.Perhaps foremost, ""King Richard"" is framed as a response to the criticism and second-guessing that the outspoken Williams faced as his daughters took the tennis world by storm, which might explain why both signed on as executive producers.Indeed, it's hard to escape the sense that ""King Richard"" exists in part to let the Williams family set the record straight. And when it comes to giving Williams his due as both a tennis guru and a father, in this case, love means everything.""King Richard"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters and on HBO Max, from Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia. It's rated PG-13.",2
348," (CNN)In a directorial father-son baton pass from Ivan Reitman to Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air""), ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is undeniably nostalgic and fairly sweet, while who-ya-gonna-calling directly back to the 1984 original. And yet with its focus on teenage heirs to that legacy, the movie simultaneously feels as much like the Disney Channel version of ""Ghostbusters"" as a long-delayed sequel.Happily, the kids are the very talented Mckenna Grace (""Gifted,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale"") and ""Stranger Things'"" Finn Wolfhard, the grandchildren of Egon Spengler (originally played by the late Harold Ramis). Egon has died, leaving a remote farmhouse to his estranged daughter (Carrie Coon), who for financial reasons finds the move timely.Moving into the place, Phoebe (Grace) and Trevor (Wolfhard) discover a lot of strange stuff happening around town -- starting with all those unexplained earthquakes -- and some nifty artifacts among grandpa's possesses. Phoebe possesses scientific acumen far beyond her years, while her brother mostly just crushes on one of his new classmates (Celeste O'Connor).Mom, meanwhile, strikes up a somewhat unexpected relationship with one of the kids' teachers (Paul Rudd, seemingly everywhere at once), adding to an adult component that produces some laughs but frankly rides in the passenger seat for much of the movie. (Coon is a gifted actress, but there's a bit of the ""E.T."" mom syndrome here, where she can't see all the weirdness happening her.)Cleverly, the film (written by Jason Reitman, Dan Aykroyd and Gil Kenan) does set up a dense mythology connecting this flurry of spectral shenanigans back to the 1980s, while playfully incorporating visual touches that recall the ""Ghostbusters"" of the past. There are also funny unrelated gags, such as Rudd's character getting through summer school by simply running wildly inappropriate horror movies.In some respects, ""Afterlife"" represents a rather conspicuous exercise in fan service, after the bizarre temper tantrum thrown by some in response to the female version of the concept that premiered five years ago. While that movie was flawed, the reaction seemed completely out of whack, elevating ""Ghostbusters"" to an overblown level of ""You ruined my childhood!"" exaltation.The elder Reitman serves as a producer on the movie, which -- with Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson promoting the movie -- isn't the only link to its Reagan-era roots. Still, this is one of those films that doesn't so much cross the streams as dip into a deep well of goodwill, hoping to bridge the gap between those who actually saw the original in a theater and kids and grandkids who will hopefully identify with the youthful protagonists.At its best ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" simply delivers a good time, combining the upgraded special effects with comedy and youthful angst, while taking a little too long to get to the good stuff.Broken down into those components, the younger Reitman has dutifully answered the call to carry on his family legacy, without quite conjuring the kind of sparks that would have made ""Afterlife"" completely rise to the occasion.""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.",2

""Gillian Anderson plays my mom, Jason Isaacs plays [Nicholas Hoult's character, Peter III's] dad.

350," (CNN)HBO has a storied history with female quartets, from ""Sex and the City"" to ""Girls."" Yet ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" carves out its own niche with a distinct voice and plenty of very funny material, capturing four young women from diverse backgrounds thrown together as roommates while coming of age as first-year college students.Co-created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, the HBO Max show actually has a lot to say, in part by uniting women whose differences in terms of race, class and geography are somewhat eclipsed by sharing the process of discovering themselves and carving out identities apart from their parents.""Mom, I'm not bringing my teddy bear to college with me,"" one complains during the moving-in stage at New England's Essex College, nicely capturing the middle ground between independence and childhood that this period uniquely represents. Cue the slow-motion shots of shirtless guys jogging, the skepticism about a boyfriend who wants to wait until marriage (""Boys are born ready, so something's up"") and issues about grappling with sexual identity.The producers have helped the process by assembling a very good cast, including Pauline Chalamet -- Timothee's sister -- as Kimberley, a wide-eyed arrival from Arizona who forever seems to be saying the wrong thing, and who lacks the connections and financial resources of her roommates. The remaining trio, Bela (Amrit Kaur), Leighton (Reneé Rapp), and (Whitney) Alyah Chanelle Scott, are equally good, with Kaur garnering the biggest laughs as a kid eager to cut loose out now that she's escaped her parents' supervision.While this is hardly new terrain, ""Sex Lives"" manages to be occasionally sweet in addition to funny, such as when a couple of them attend a ""naked party"" and get chided for looking down at others', um, nakedness.""So we're not supposed to look? What is this, a naked party under Taliban rule?"" Bela complains.Later, Whitney -- the daughter of a senator -- grudgingly attends a fraternity party along with the wealthy Leighton, telling the sea of blond girls that she meets, ""I look forward to seeing you all on 'Selling Sunset' one day.""Amid the jokes and uncomfortable situations (including a positively cringeworthy dinner during parents' weekend in a later episode), there's an almost palpable sense of the desperate desire to fit in, as well as how significant the college years are in defining people as they mature.In that sense, ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" is a rather simplistic, marketing-friendly title for a show that's refreshingly about a lot more than that.As it happens, the series will conclude the same day that HBO's ""Sex and the City"" revival hits the streaming service, a nod to the genre's past. If ""Sex Lives"" is in some respects a spiritual heir, it makes a strong case that meeting the next generation has more creative promise than revisiting an earlier one.""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" premieres Nov. 18 on HBO Max. CNN and HBO Max are both part of WarnerMedia.",2

352," (CNN)Lin-Manuel Miranda is not throwing his shots, and in 2021, the creator of ""Hamilton"" has been getting a whole lot of them.After his earlier work ""In the Heights"" became a critically admired (if little seen) movie, Miranda has made his directing debut with ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!,"" a loving adaptation of ""Rent"" creator Jonathan Larson's coming-of-stage story, and written eight original songs for ""Encanto,"" a Disney animated film featuring a predominantly Latinx cast. That follows another animated movie, Netflix's ""Vivo,"" which he produced in addition to writing the music.Although he is working from a script by Steve Levenson (""Dear Evan Hansen""), Miranda has clearly approached ""Tick, Tick"" as a deeply personal ode to musical theater in general and in particular Larson, who tragically died on the eve of what would become ""Rent's"" record-breaking run at the age of 35.Deftly expanding the source material into a movie, the film is anchored by a sensational performance by Andrew Garfield as Larson, with the title referring to the sense that his bravado about becoming ""the future of musical theater"" is running dry, with timing running out, in his eyes, as he approaches his 30th birthday.Capturing the creative process on film also poses a tricky proposition, but Miranda mostly manages to do just that, while conveying the palpable anxiety that Larson feels about at what point he transitions from being a writer who waits tables to make ends meet to becoming ""a waiter with a hobby.""The echoes of ""Rent"" throughout are also everywhere, reflecting how Larson eventually went from trying to sell an esoteric concept set in the future to writing about subjects very close to home, including struggles to keep the lights on (literally) and the ravages of AIDS at the time.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" is filled with happy surprises, and Garfield receives able support from Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesus and Vanessa Hudgens, as well as Bradley Whitford as legendary composer Stephen Sondheim.If Larson took the right advice when he decided to ""write what you know,"" Miranda, as a director, has taken that advice to heart as well.As for ""Encanto,"" feeling like an outcast is one of the most durable themes in Disney animation, which has become more relevant as those movies have moved in a more progressive direction than ol' Walt's early days. ""Encanto"" reflects a more recent tradition, in a movie about what makes us special, seriously enlivened, again, by Miranda's musical gifts.Miranda did the same for ""Moana,"" and ""Encanto"" possesses many similar charms, with a sizable dollop of ""The Incredibles"" in its focus on a super-powered family. The main departure, and it's an interesting one, is the lack of a traditional villain, an absence that's felt but mostly overcome by the warmth and energy behind the execution, which effectively draws audiences into the story.Set in a magical town in Colombia, Disney's 60th animated feature begins with a nod to a particularly sober real-world phenomenon -- namely, the plight of refugees. But amid their loss comes the magic that has made the Madrigal family flourish, with each possessing a remarkable gift under the watchful eye of matriarch Alma (María Cecilia Botero).Everyone, that is, except Mirabel (""Brooklyn Nine-Nine's"" Stephanie Beatriz), who emerged empty-handed from the gifting ritual, still determined  to be as much a part of the family as her parents and sisters.""Gift or no gift, I am just as special as the rest of my family,"" Mirabel tells the local children, but she seems as doubtful of the truth of that as they are.Still, just as one of Mirabel's cousins comes of age and her sister is about to marry, strange things start happening, with signs that the family's magic is beginning to fade. Mirabel thus becomes the Cassandra warning of danger, something her grandma has no interest in hearing, merely reinforcing Miirabel's sense that it has fallen to her to save everyone.Directed Jared Bush and Byron Howard (""Zootopia"") and co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, ""Encanto"" compensates for the dearth of traditional conflict with a colorful world filled with powers and an abundance of music.""I will never be good enough for you,"" an exasperated Mirabel says at one point.Happily, ""Encanto"" is plenty good enough for families seeking a sprinkle of that Disney animated magic, just as is ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" brings theater into the home.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" premieres Nov. 19 on Netflix. ""Encanto"" premieres in US theaters on Nov. 24. It's rated PG.",2
353," (CNN)""Queens"" is an extremely familiar idea, elevated not quite to the level of royalty by being slickly cast, packaged and produced. Like Peacock's ""Girls5eva,"" the concept hinges on an all-girl group reunited and again pursuing stardom 20 years later, rediscovering the spotlight and its perils after years spent braiding hair and burning breakfast.Those last mundane activities are how we meet Brianna (Eve), once known as Professor Sex, who is now raising five kids. Methodically, the show goes about introducing the rest of the quartet once known as the Nasty Bitches (a name itself rooted in the past), who, as Jill a.k.a. Da Thrill (Naturi Naughton), notes, ""stood on top of the world for a hot minute.""The other members of the group, Naomi/Xplicit Lyrics (Brandy) and Valeria/Butter Pecan (Nadine Velazquez), had a sour falling out, with the former toiling away as a solo act -- ""still chasing the fame that you found 20 years ago,"" as she's told -- and the latter having successfully transitioned into morning TV, where her unbridled ambition is on full display.It's their manager (Taylor Sele) who suggests getting the band back together as part of a televised event, and the lure of a quick payout is enough to erode the resistance on several fronts. But this is a series, after all, so the reunion won't end there, with the challenge of mounting a formal comeback and all the soapy doings that go with it.As noted, the idea of one-time stars nursing old grudges and grasping for another few minutes of fame is hardly a new one (Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" is an ode to one-hit wonders), but the hip-hop backdrop and casting gives ""Queens"" a relatively fresh feel. The disclaimer would be that once you get past the premise, the series becomes another soap set against the backdrop of the music world, a la ""Empire,"" meaning it will only be as good as the situations that the writers can continue to conjure.Produced by ""Scandal"" alum Zahir McGhee (who wrote the pilot) and directed by Tim Story, ""Queens"" appears to be in pretty good hands on that score, even if the content and actually-not-that-explicit lyrics can only be as nasty as ABC's standards will allow. The show also figures to get a boost, in old-fashioned TV scheduling terms, from having ""The Bachelorette"" as its opening act.For now, ""Queens"" has done an admirable job assembling the pieces. Keeping them from flaming out the way that the show's fictional group did could be another matter.""Queens"" premieres Oct. 19 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.",2
354," (CNN)Success hasn't spoiled ""Succession,"" as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of ""Veep"" blush.Having become HBO's version of ""Game of Thrones"" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of ""fine wines"" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, ""Can I do this? Can I win?""Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.While Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by ""Succession"" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with ""Veep,"" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.""Succession"" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that ""Game of Thrones"" comparison, the battles on ""Succession"" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.""Succession"" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",2
355," (CNN)Pete Buttigieg is such a smooth political operator that even the fly-on-the-wall access to his 2020 presidential run granted the makers of ""Mayor Pete"" only produces so much insight into his historic campaign. Mostly, the documentary premiering on Amazon serves as a social-studies lesson in how campaigns operate, with the most candid moments coming from those other than the candidate.Seeking to become the first mayor to graduate directly to the White House, Buttigieg always appeared to be running for national attention and some intermediate position, given the hurdles that the mayor of South Bend would face winning a statewide race in deep-red Indiana. Yet his long-shot campaign captured the imagination of many and caused brief flickers of hope that he could actually go the distance.Directed by Jesse Moss, ""Mayor Pete"" captures all of that, including Buttigieg's status as gay man and his decision to openly discuss that, as he says, ""without it swallowing who I was and what our campaign was about.""Still, Buttigieg speaks in such perfect sound bites that it's difficult even in these casual moments to penetrate those barriers. As a consequence, some of the most telling insights coming from his husband, Chasten Buttigieg -- who recalls that ""Nobody was out"" when he was in high school -- and campaign communications director Lis Smith, who peppers her dialogue with expletives as she bluntly lectures the candidate for being too clinical in answering questions that call for displays of passion or emotion.For all that, some of the behind-the-curtain glimpses are fascinating, from a friendly exchange with Joe Biden, his current boss, as the two run across each other on the trail to the strategizing with staff, from messaging to debate prep.""It's not even a debate,"" Buttigieg corrects them at one point. ""It's a media opportunity.""The filmmakers also catch the group briefly (and comically) stranded in an elevator, dealing with a crisis involving a police shooting in South Bend and at the moment when Buttigieg accepts that his improbable pursuit of the Oval Office has reached its end. ""That's how you end a presidential campaign,"" he says, with a tilt toward the camera, before opting to endorse Biden.Currently serving as Secretary of Transportation at the ripe old age of 39, Buttigieg clearly has plenty of runway ahead of him in terms of pursuing future political ambitions.Depending on where that leads, ""Mayor Pete"" is perhaps most significant as a snapshot of a very specific moment, and potentially a road map for the journey to come.""Mayor Pete"" premieres Nov. 12 on Amazon.",2
356," (CNN)Manchester United started life without Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a 2-0 victory against Villarreal on Tuesday courtesy of goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho. The win means United, which parted with manager Solskjaer at the weekend after a poor string of results, qualifies for the knockout stages of the Champions League.Michael Carrick stood in as caretaker manager ahead of the game at the Estadio de la Ceramica, and he watched on as United struggled to create chances for much of the contestBut his side burst into life towards the end of the second half, the two goals ensuring United reaches the Champions League last 16 with a game to spare. Ronaldo opened the scoring with 12 minutes of the match remaining as he capitalized on a poor pass from Villarreal goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli to Etienne Capoue -- who was put under pressure by Fred -- to chip the ball over Rulli. Sancho then grabbed his first United goal and wrapped up the win in the game's final moments as he finished off a counter-attacking move involving Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes.The victory will be a huge boost for United and Carrick following the team's 4-1 defeat against Watford on Saturday. ""When you've suffered results-wise and you're not in a great vein of form individually and as a team then it's not easy to come out and just let everything click,"" Carrick told BT Sport after the game.""In some ways, it was the best way to win for me, that we had to show some character, we had to dig in, we had to fight.""Villarreal, which defeated United to win the Europa League last season, dominated possession in the first half and had chances to take an early lead through Moi Gómez and Yeremi Pino. United goalkeeper David de Gea was then twice called into action by Manu Trigueros -- once in the first half and again midway through the second half -- and twice produced good saves to deny the midfielder. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresThat kept United in the game and able to find the breakthrough via Ronaldo, who scored the winning goal when these two sides met in September.More chances came for the visiting side for Ronaldo and Rashford, but it was Sancho who got the second with a thumping shot into the top of the net.Villarreal faces Atalanta next week in its bid to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages.

Beijing is the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games.On Sunday, the IOC said in a statement that its president, Thomas Bach, had a 30-minute video call with three-time Olympian Peng Shuai, joined by a Chinese sports official and an IOC official.The statement said that, during the call, Peng appeared to be ""doing fine"" and ""relaxed,"" and said she ""would like to have her privacy respected."" The IOC did not explain how the video call with Peng had been organized.'Big surprise'HRW also suggested the IOC should have done more to protect the Chinese Olympian athlete.""it's a whole different order of magnitude to see Thomas Bach, in a photograph with a woman, Peng Shuai, under intense pressure, we can reasonably assume from other cases, to walk back her claims of sexual assault, rather than figuring doing everything in his and the organization's power to call that out and make sure that she is afforded the support and investigation and prosecution that may well be warranted,"" Richardson said.In response, the IOC told CNN that the ""Olympic Games are the only event that brings the entire world together in peaceful competition."" ""They are the most powerful symbol of unity in all our diversity that the world knows,"" said the IOC statement.""In our fragile world, the power of sport to bring the whole world together, despite all the existing differences, gives us all hope for a better future.""Given the diverse participation in the Olympic Games, the IOC must remain neutral on all global political issues.""At all times, the IOC recognises and upholds human rights as enshrined in both the Fundamental Principles of the Olympic Charter and in its Code of Ethics. ""We are responsible for ensuring the respect of the Olympic Charter with regard to the Olympic Games and take this responsibility very seriously.""All interested parties have to provide assurances that the principles of the Olympic Charter will be respected in the context of the Games, and both the Japanese and Chinese organisers have done so for the recent Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 and upcoming Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.""Ability to report in ChinaConcerns were raised during the HRW press conference regarding the ability to report in China and how that could impact Peng's ongoing situation.""It is very hard to report on what is happening in China,"" the Director of Global Initiatives for Human Rights Watch, Minky Worden, said.""Chinese officials are blocking not just a United Nations backed investigation into human rights violations, but also the journalists the world relies on to reveal new abuses. ""So, it was a big surprise on Sunday to see the International Olympic Committee president and senior officials interview Chinese three time Olympian and former world number one doubles tennis player Peng Shuai by video,"" Worden added.Peng, 35, went missing on November 2 after she said on Chinese social media that she had been sexually assaulted and forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang Gaoli, 75, who was China's vice premier from 2013 to 2018.The allegations were censored in mainland China. CNN's broadcast signal was also censored during Peng reporting.Earlier on Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the government hoped ""malicious speculation"" about Peng's well-being and whereabouts would stop, and that her case should not be politicized.Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, declined to comment on whether the Chinese government will launch an investigation into Peng's sexual assault allegations against former Vice Premier Zhang. He repeated previous comments made to reporters, saying Peng's situation ""was not a diplomatic issue.""Peng, a two-time grand slam doubles champion and one of China's top tennis players, publicly accused Zhang of coercing her into sex at his home, according to screenshots of a since-deleted social media post dated November 2.Her disappearance from public life for more than two weeks following the accusation prompted an outpouring of international concern, with the Women's Tennis Association and the United Nations calling for an investigation into her allegations of sexual assault.",2

359," (CNN)With just under a year to go until the Qatar 2022 World Cup, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that he has seen ""great evolution"" in the Gulf country. Speaking to CNN Sport's Amanda Davies, Infantino was questioned on reports -- the most recent from the International Labour Organization (ILO) on Thursday -- regarding human rights issues in Qatar.Last week's ILO report said that at least 50 of Qatar's workers died in 2020, stating that the country was inadequately investigating these workplace deaths. Non-governmental organizations have alleged that migrant workers involved in World Cup infrastructure projects have been mistreated and abused.Qatar's Ministry of Labour said in a statement that ""figures reported in media on migrant worker fatalities have been wildly misleading.""""The government has been transparent about the health of our foreign population, and in reality, levels of mortality in Qatar are on par with wider demographics globally.

360," (CNN)Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers returned to winning ways on Monday Night Football, beating the New York Giants 30-10 at Raymond James Stadium. Brady threw 307 passing yards and two touchdowns as the Bucs ended their two-game losing streak on Monday night, continuing the Giants' season of struggles. The 44-year-old also avoided losing three in a row for the first time since 2002. It was the 104th time in Brady's career that he's finished with over 300 passing yards. Only Drew Brees with 123 has more such games in NFL history.After the Tampa Bay's disappointing Week 10 loss to the Washington Football Team, Brady cut a frustrated character in his postgame press conference. However, on Monday night, the veteran quarterback looked much more content. ""We played better,"" a smiling Brady said. ""Better for all of us when we play better.""He added: ""We're at a decent point, but we can play a lot better than we've played. Hoping our best football is ahead of us.""A 300-pound record-breaking eveningAfter two underwhelming performances, Monday night started much better for the Bucs. Brady connected with Chris Godwin for a 13-yard touchdown in the first quarter to give the home team the lead early on. However, the former New England Patriots quarterback's second quarter intercepted pass allowed New York to draw level. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones threw a touchdown to offensive lineman Andrew Thomas to tie the score at 10-10, but the Bucs turned the screw from there. Brady was almost flawless for the rest of the game, and the Tampa Bay defense stymied the Giants' offense.Jones was sacked twice and threw two interceptions to Steve McLendon and Mike Edwards while Ronald Jones ran in the third of Tampa Bay's touchdowns.For the first time in NFL history, a 300-pound player had a touchdown (Thomas) and a 300-pound player had an interception (McLendon) in the same game.It was a particularly momentous game for Bucs wide receiver Mike Evans, who -- when he caught a five-yard TD pass from Brady -- entered himself into the team's history books. It was Evans' 72nd touchdown for the franchise, breaking the previous record for the most Bucs touchdowns of 71 set by Mike Alstott. Evans can add the record to his ever-growing resume of Tampa Bay all-time records. He already holds Bucs franchise records for receptions, receiving yards, touchdown catches and 100-yard receiving games. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosHe also has the single-season records for receiving yards and touchdown catches and is tied for the most overall touchdowns in a single season.He's now got 10 touchdowns on the year, the fourth time in eight NFL seasons he's reached double digits in that category.

361," (CNN)The coach of the Chicago Red Stars resigned Sunday, a day after leading his team to the National Women's Soccer League title game and a day before a Washington Post report alleged that players had accused him of verbal and emotional abuse.Rory Dames' resignation was announced in a press release dated Sunday from the Red Stars, which lost Saturday 2-1 to the Washington Spirit. The statement made no mention of the allegations.The story Monday in the Post is the latest chapter to roil the 10-team league, which has been facing a reckoning over the treatment of its players. The Post reported players had turned to the US Soccer Federation for help about the alleged abuse instead of the NWSL. CNN has reached out to Dames for comment.Last month, the NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird resigned and the league called off weekend matches following a report by The Athletic detailing allegations of sexual coercion and misconduct against Paul Riley, who coached three NWSL franchises over eight seasons. Riley in an email to The Athletic denied the claims.In addition, the CEO and managing partner of the Washington Spirit resigned and referenced a recent request by the players, who cited concerns over workplace environment, as part of the reason for stepping down.FIFA, the international governing body for soccer, announced an investigation as did US Soccer, the latter retaining former acting Attorney General Sally Yates of King & Spalding LLP to lead the probe into allegations of abusive behavior and sexual misconduct.On October 29, the players association said the league had agreed to meet all the players' demands for cultural changes and transparency following the earlier reports of sexual misconduct.Dames said he was resigning to focus on his familyIn a statement Monday, the Red Stars said they stood with the players ""who are fiercely advocating for change, and we are committed to doing our part to ensure a safe environment"" for players, staff, volunteers and fans. When Dames' resignation was announced, neither the team nor the coach referenced the allegations. ""For 11 years, I have dedicated myself to help build the Chicago Red Stars into one of the top international clubs,"" Dames said in the team's press release. ""Effective today, I'm refocusing my attention to my family and future endeavors, and I am resigning as coach of the Chicago Red Stars.""In the same statement posted on the Stars' website, the team said that ""under Rory's leadership we have been a remarkably consistent and excellent club on the field,"" adding that it was time to begin a new chapter with the search for new leadership.The Post reported one of the players who complained about Dames was Christen Press, a member of the US Women's National Team and a former Red Stars player. According to the Post, Press said she told then-US Soccer president Sunil Gulati her concerns about Dames in 2014, and she filed a formal complaint to US Soccer about Dames in 2018. CNN has reached out to Gulati for comment.The NWSL Players Association said in a statement that the system has failed the players. ""Nothing short of a complete transformation of our league will suffice,"" the association said.",2
362," (CNN)Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James on Monday was suspended for a game without pay for the first time for making contact with Detroit Pistons star Isaiah Stewart in the face.James had been ejected during a game against the Pistons on Sunday.The ejection was only the second in James' career -- the first coming in 2017 for comments made to a referee. Sunday's altercation occurred with 9:18 remaining in the third quarter and the Lakers trailing 78-66 in Detroit. As a free throw was being attempted, James swung his arm backward while boxing out for a rebound, hitting Stewart. The foul led to a prolonged game stoppage while Stewart, with blood coming down his face, had to be held back by Detroit coaches and players as he tried to confront James on several occasions. Stewart was also ejected from the game.The Lakers went on to win 121-116.The NBA issued a release Monday saying that Stewart will be suspended for two games without pay for ""escalating"" the confrontation and ""repeatedly and aggressively"" pursuing James. James and Stewart did not speak to the media after the game. CNN has reached out to the Lakers for comment.Lakers teammate Anthony Davis came to the defense of James after the game, saying that James isn't a ""dirty guy"" and that he wasn't sure why Stewart reacted the way he did.""I've never, in 10 years, seen a player try to do that as long as I've been playing, at least in basketball. It's uncalled for. You got a cut above your eye, accidental -- like, it wasn't on purpose. And we weren't going to allow him to keep charging our brother like that,"" Davis said.Lakers head coach Frank Vogel said he spoke to James in the locker room after the game.""Yeah, that's really something that should stay in the locker room,"" Vogel said. ""I mean, I talked to him, yup, but I'm not going to disclose what his message was.""Stewart was ""upset,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said after the game. ""I told him, 'Don't let this define who you are. It doesn't define your game whatsoever.' I felt for the young man because he's such a competitor and he plays so hard. He's a great kid but he felt like he got cheap-shotted across his brow and on the street, it would be a different story,"" Casey said.",2
363," (CNN)Within hours of Manchester United announcing the sacking of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the hashtag 'ThankYouOle' started trending. It was yet another reminder that, despite disappointing results, the club as a global brand seems to be as strong as ever, continuing to boast a social media following that is the envy of many sports entities worldwide. No club in the Premier League, for instance, can come close to matching United's Twitter following of 28.5 million people -- league leader Chelsea comes closest with almost 10 million less. But winning the social media race will offer fans little consolation, with Solskjaer's departure coming at a time when the club is falling further behind its rivals on the pitch.Last year's runner-up is currently languishing in eighth after four losses in its last five league games and the team, particularly the defense, looks short of organization and structure. Following a humiliating 4-1 defeat against Watford in Solskjaer's last game on Sunday, United goalkeeper David de Gea summed it up by saying: ""We don't know what to do with the ball, we are conceding a lot of goals. It's a horrible moment.""Solskjaer was hired to bring the good times back to Old Trafford and, at times, he did so. A Champions League win against PSG and derby victories against Manchester City have given fans memories to last but Solskjaer failed to deliver a trophy during his reign. Performances this season have also looked particularly poor, with recent defeats to Manchester City and Liverpool demonstrating the growing gap in quality between United and those realistically challenging for the title.In his first two seasons in charge, the manager could explain poor results away as the club being in a rebuilding process, but this season was different. The board had backed Solskjaer in the transfer market with the signings of Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and Cristiano Ronaldo, and there was simply no room for excuses when you had a squad bubbling over with elite talent. No one within the club has publicly questioned Solskjaer's sincerity -- Ronaldo himself called his former manager an ""outstanding human being"" in a post on social media Monday -- but many have questioned his ability to coach at the highest level. The job for the next boss is getting a tune out of a team of world class individuals. ""I think there is potential in this club. We all love the club, and we all want to see it continue,"" Solskjaer said in his goodbye interview with the club, a video which attracted over 3.9 million views on Twitter.READ: Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta explains fiery clash with Jurgen Klopp during defeat to LiverpoolWhat next? As has been the case for United's hierarchy since the departure of Alex Ferguson in 2013, there seems to be little planned for life after the last manager. The club announced that Michael Carrick, Solskjaer's right-hand man who has never taken charge of a Premier League game in his life, will fill in until an interim manager takes over until the end of the season.No one can deny Carrick was a brilliant player for the club, but questions remain on whether he can bring anything different to the table given his heavy involvement in Solskjaer's term. The timing of this decision has hardly been great either, with many of the game's top coaches already in jobs. United decided to sack Solskjaer almost three weeks after Antonio Conte, a potential replacement, was signed by Tottenham Hotspur.Ex-Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane and current PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino are being rumored as full-time replacements but United still has to navigate a tricky season with qualification to next year's Champions League looking like an uphill struggle -- failure to do so will be a huge blow both on and off the pitch. READ: French league game abandoned after player hit in head by water bottle thrown from crowd'They've been caught out again'From the club's board down to the coaching staff, organization of the team has been far below expectations and those at the very top don't appear to have learned a lesson from previous failings. The Glazer owners and departing executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward have been accused of not caring enough about performances on the pitch, and they have once again been criticized for not having a plan in place.""I don't really want to stick the knife in today to the club's owners and the club's hierarchy but you have to ask serious questions. I've had enough of it,"" former United player Gary Neville told Sky Sports. ""I think the club is run, on a business side, okay but I think culturally and from the point of view of football decision-making, it leaves a lot to be desired.""They've been caught out again, they've been caught out in the last few weeks, they've not known what to do.""According to the Financial Times, the club aims to return to pre-pandemic annual revenues of more than $800m and, no doubt, its social media following will continue to grow. But until United is back challenging for trophies again, fans will continue to put pressure on the club's hierarchy who will hope to avoid yet another embarrassing episode in what has been a turbulent period in the club's history.

He says moving to France and being racially abused by children at school was the first time he became conscious that he was seen as a Black person in society. Thuram says he was subject to racist abuse, such as monkey chants, throughout his playing career, notably after signing for Italian club Parma in 1996. He recently wrote a book entitled White Thinking: Behind the Mask of Racial Identity which addresses how societal norms still work to divide people and fuel systemic racism. He says education is the key to tackling the issue in a more meaningful way, both in football and in wider society. There have been many incidents of racism throughout world football this season, with players being abused both on the pitch and through social media. Recently, Germany's Olympic football team walked off the pitch during a friendly match against Honduras after one of the German players was racially abused, according to the German Football Association (DFB). Thuram urged athletes to not be complicit and to continue using their platforms to be activists for social causes. ""You have to know that the authorities are going to be able to promote more equality in society because we're going to oblige them to do so,"" he said. ""That's why you need to educate each and every one to understand that we have a role to play, and we have to have the courage to denounce injustices. ""It's the number of people demanding change that will force the institutions to change."" READ: Kaepernick details intensive training regime in rare interview as he refuses to give up on NFL returnFollowing a number of high-profile incidents in 2019, European football's governing body UEFA introduced a three-step protocol for referees when combating racism in the stadium. It gave officials the option to abandon the game ""as a final resort"" if racism continued after restarting the match for a second time. Meanwhile, world football's governing body FIFA says it is continuously working with the EU Commission to eradicate discrimination from the game. ""There is no place for racial discrimination in football or in society,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said earlier this year. ""As the governing body of football worldwide, FIFA recognizes and embraces its responsibility to lead the fight against discrimination."" Since retiring from professional football in 2008, Thuram has watched his son, Marcus, follow his footsteps into the pro game. Now playing in Germany for Borussia Monchengladbach, Marcus was one of the many players to take a knee during a game following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Other players used their social media platforms to share messages of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, and English Premier League clubs still take a knee before every match in order to raise awareness of discrimination. ""What was extremely interesting after the death of George Floyd was that many of the players who took the knee were young players,"" Thuram said. ""That's something very important and it shows why we have to educate the youngest people in society because, as a general rule, it is them who enact the change.""READ: Muhammad Ali -- the glory and the strugglePushing for a better futureThuram has praised White players such as Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson for addressing the subject of racial injustice but is aware that athletes, particularly Black athletes, could face criticism for speaking out. Colin Kaepernick, for example, became a lightning rod in 2016 when the former NFL quarterback took a knee during the National Anthem, protesting racial injustice and what he said was ongoing police brutality in the US. He drew fierce criticism from some for kneeling and has not been signed to a team ever since. Thuram says he is not surprised that young Black people speaking out have prompted such a response but says history will be kind to those who do. ""Things haven't changed,"" he said. ""You need to know that historically, the people who denounce the racism of a political system, of institutions, are usually always put on the sidelines. ""This could mean physically eliminated: there was a time [that] people were killed for denouncing racism. ""Nowadays, we present Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela as great people. But you have to remember that, in their lifetimes, they were put in prison. ""They were also attacked for denouncing institutional racism, so the fact that Colin Kaepernick cannot find a team in fact follows logic."" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosThuram is aware that the issue of racism is prevalent in many other sports and says it's important that sponsors and clubs don't abandon those who speak out against it. In terms of a long-term resolution to such issues, Thuram reiterates that education and understanding the history of racism is vital. ""We must talk with the players, educate the players so that they know they have real power over the decisions that institutions can take to combat racism,"" he added. ""Because very often, regardless of their skin color, players do not understand the strategies that can be put in place to improve equality.""",2
366," (CNN)Every sports team has an expectation to succeed, but few do like the All Blacks. The burden of public opinion -- as well as the high standards set by the players themselves -- can weigh heavily on those representing New Zealand's rugby team, the top-ranked side in the world for much of the past decade. ""There's huge public expectation in New Zealand when it comes to representing the All Blacks or even provincial and Super Rugby teams,"" fly-half Beauden Barrett recently told CNN Sport.Barrett, who made his 100th appearance for the All Blacks last month, has been a regular presence in the team since he made his test debut in 2012. Having grown up idolizing the All Blacks, he's acutely aware of the scrutiny he and his teammates face in rugby-mad New Zealand. ""Our legacy is a very strong and proud one, and as current players, we want to do our part to leave the jersey in a better place or add value, add to the legacy,"" he says. ""Even if we have a good win, our people like to pick it apart and still heavily criticize and that's the way it is. We have very high standards.""Those high standards mean the All Blacks are facing difficult questions after a 29-20 loss against Ireland on Saturday. The thrilling contest in Dublin was Ireland's third win against the Kiwis in the sides' past five meetings. It comes after comfortable wins against the USA, Wales and Italy had propelled New Zealand back to the top of the world rankings having ceded the top spot to South Africa, who defeated the All Blacks in the final game of the Rugby Championship earlier this year.

""I think we've learned some techniques about how to deal with the expectations,"" Foster told CNN Sport. ""Rather than sort of being crushed by it or seeing it as being oppressive, we're trying to take an approach of getting excited about it.""He added: ""What we can't do is have players go out there feeling too much of a fear factor that if they stuff up, the world is going to come collapsing on them. ""It's about enabling them to use the expectations to create a skillset and a way of expressing that they can be really proud of.""New Zealand's obsession with rugby -- and the period of national mourning that can follow defeats -- was exemplified after the All Blacks were knocked out of the Rugby World Cup by England two years ago. ""The All Blacks are out of the World Cup. If you want to read more, go to the sports section,"" were the only two lines on the front page of the New Zealand Herald on Sunday after that defeat.Focus on FranceFoster took over from Steve Hansen as the All Blacks head coach after the 2019 World Cup having been an assistant coach since 2012. His aim as head coach, he says, has been to create an environment that's ""fun,"" but also where ""every day you've got to turn out and you've got to try and be the best.""""When I came in as a coach about 10 years ago, it was quite overpowering,"" Foster explains.""You're walking into an environment where you know expectations are incredibly high; it's an environment that can suffocate you because you have to win and you have to perform well.""After the defeat against Ireland, the All Blacks again lost their place at the top of the men's world rankings to South Africa -- although the desire to be the number one side in the world is only part of what motivates the team's players.""Clearly, we want to be the best team in the world,"" said Barrett, who was withdrawn from Saturday's game against Ireland after failing a head injury assessment. ""To be honest, even if we're number one, we'd still probably feel -- or have the same desire or drive -- to be the best we could be.""For All Blacks captain and second row Sam Whitelock, his approach to the game always starts with his own performance.""I know that if I go out there and play really well myself, I can help the team,"" Whitelock told CNN Sport. ""So I look at it individually first. ""Ideally, you'd always want to be number one (in the world rankings), but if you go out there and play your game, then you can help influence the team. And then, obviously, the team can sort out who is number one, number two or whatever.""With France looming, Foster said at the start of this week that his side will be eager to make amends for the defeat against Ireland, when they were starved of possession and forced to make more than 200 tackles over the course of the game.""I don't think we'll be short of motivation at all,"" said Foster. ""Our senior players and leaders are hurting and already starting to think about our plan for this week.""",2
367," (CNN)While South Africa's rugby team has decided not to take a knee before games, former Springbok Bryan Habana says he would have done so if he had the opportunity during his playing days.Male and female rugby players at club and international level chose to take a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement over the past 18 months, but the gesture has not been adopted unanimously by teams and players across the sport. The Springboks -- world champions in 1995, 2007 and 2019 -- are one such example. Earlier this year, head coach Rassie Erasmus said his side was focused on supporting South Africa Rugby's own anti-racism and anti-discrimination program, RADAR, rather than taking a knee before games.""I just don't think it's a directive at the moment,"" Habana, who made 124 appearances for the Springboks and scored 67 tries, told CNN Sport of the decision not to take a knee.He added: ""All players in that squad have had various statements throughout the course of the last year and a half, and in so doing, hopefully show that rugby is definitely against racism.""Asked if he would have taken the knee as a player, Habana said: ""I think I would, if we were asked to do it or if there was an opportunity to do it.""We saw with the Autumn Nations Cup last year held in the UK that there was a number of players that would do it, and I would have most certainly done if given the opportunity.""The act of taking a knee, which was popularized by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 as a protest against racial injustice and police brutality, has proved a divisive subject when it comes to sport in South Africa. Last year, South African players for English Premiership side Sale Sharks were the attention of public scrutiny for not taking the knee; like their teammates, they wore T-shirts with the words ""Rugby Against Racism"" ahead of games. Then last month, South African cricketer Quinton de Kock apologized for refusing to take the knee at the T20 Cricket World Cup and insisted he is ""not a racist."" Cricket South Africa had previously ordered all players to take a knee before game at the tournament, but wicketkeeper de Kock made the ""personal decision"" not to. READ: How the All Blacks handle 'huge public expectation''Rugby as a true dream'The Springboks' Rugby World Cup triumph two years ago signaled a landmark moment in South Africa's sporting and social history with Siya Kolisi, the team's first Black captain, lifting the Webb Ellis Trophy. It came 24 years after Francois Pienaar had accepted the trophy from Nelson Mandela a year after the end of apartheid -- an iconic moment in rugby history. Habana, who scored a joint-record 15 World Cup tries during his career, has lauded today's Springboks side as being ""truly representative"" of South Africa. ""Having our captain [Siya Kolisi] being the first Black African to not only captain and then win a World Cup, to have the likes of [wingers] Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe become the first players to score a try in a Rugby World Cup final for South Africa and really have tangible stories that relate to 60-odd percent of our population that can actually now see rugby as a true dream I think is extremely special,"" he said.Since the World Cup, the Springboks have continued to play with power and precision under Erasmus' guidance and recently returned to the top of World Rugby's rankings ahead of New Zealand following victories against Scotland and Wales. Their style has received some criticism -- notably for its emphasis on forward play and set-piece dominance -- but the side has demonstrated that it can play attractive rugby, too, most recently as Mapimpi scored two tries by exploiting the wide channels against Scotland on Saturday. Habana, who retired from rugby in 2018, has no qualms about the way the current South African side plays. ""As a previous player and someone that knows that winning can make or break your career, I think when you play towards your strengths, when you play towards things that make you better and make you win, it's really important to understand potentially where the criticism comes from,"" said Habana, speaking as a Land Rover ambassador during the release of the nominations for the World Rugby awards.He added: ""What we have seen over the course of the last few years, it is extremely effective and successful. I know that the boys will be more concerned about winning than potentially about the style of play. The longer they win for, I think the more enjoyable they will be post the game.""Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features'Mouthwatering' World Cup final repeatThe Springboks' next game is against England at Twickenham on Saturday -- a repeat of the 2019 World Cup final. And for added intrigue, Erasmus was banned from rugby for two months this week after being found guilty of threatening match officials during this year's British and Irish Lions tour. He has also been banned from all match-day activities until September next year and warned about his future conduct. South Africa Rugby has been fined $27,000 (£20,000) over the incident, which saw Erasmus release an hour-long video criticizing the performance of match official Nic Berry.Heading into Saturday's game, England is undefeated since March and recorded its eighth consecutive victory against Australia last week, while South Africa is looking to complete a clean sweep in this month's Autumn Internationals. ""I think, in this England side, they are brimming with confidence,"" said Habana.""If one looks at what happened last weekend against Australia, South Africa will have to be extremely wary in all facets of play if they want to try to replicate what happened in 2019.

368," (CNN)When the cards were dealt, Chris Moneymaker could hardly have been happy.Sure, he was the chip leader at the 2003 World Series of Poker (WSOP) having miraculously, and literally, battled against the odds all the way to make it to the final table out of 839 entrants. And now, from his initial $86 satellite entry fee granting him a seat at the WSOP -- the price of admission to enter the tournament at Binion's Hotel in Las Vegas could have been $10,000 -- a million-dollar payout was guaranteed.Over the course of one week in May, 837 contenders had been eliminated, leaving this amateur online player going up against seasoned professional Sam Farha. And as they played heads-up Texas Hold 'Em, Moneymaker must have wanted the glory of winning the most prestigious prize in poker, to say nothing of the $2.5 million on offer to the winner.And regardless of Farha's starting hand, Moneymaker's five of diamonds and four of spades did not exactly inspire confidence. But by this point, destiny was clearly calling.All in the nameJudging by his name, you might think that Chris Moneymaker was meant to have been involved with dealing in sums. And you would be right.Growing up in Knoxville, Tennessee, Moneymaker became an accountant and -- as he told CNN Sport as part of an interview discussing his involvement working with VELO's sponsorship with the World Series of Poker, who are highlighting how poker skills can translate beyond the table -- he acknowledged how translation also played a part in his surname.""My father is Moneymaker, and we've had a long line of males in our family tree,"" he says. ""From what I've been told [...] they made silver and gold coins.""The name was originally Nurmacher. And when they went to England, they took the literal translation of someone that made the silver and gold coins and it was Moneymaker.""Moneymaker's love of card and table games resulted in poker becoming more of a regular occurrence in his routine. But it wasn't likely to lead to a career change and, even his partaking in an $86 satellite tournament, leading to a follow up tournament where a seat at the famed WSOP was at stake, wasn't his pressing priority.In fact, Moneymaker says not winning that second tournament was more important -- to the extent of trying to lose on purpose -- because a fourth-place spot meant a cash prize.Moneymaker says ""it was a complete mistake"" that he even entered to try and land a place at the WSOP, ""I thought I was playing for cash. We got down to five-handed [five players left] and I'm actually chip leader and I'm trying to actively get fourth place because I want the $8,000 in cash.""I don't want the seat to go play in the World Series of Poker to go play against the best players in the world because I'm just an amateur player playing with friends. I've never played against a pro in my life. And $8,000 would go a long way to paying off my bills and helping with things around the house.""My goal was to win that eight grand. And a buddy talked me into taking the seat, and that's how I got the World Series seat. And the rest is history.""Like a Hollywood scriptHistory indeed. Moneymaker's magnificent run in 2003 happened to coincide with what he calls ""a dark period"" for the iconic pastime. ""Poker rooms were shutting down,"" Moneymaker notes. ""The game was in decline. It was really sort of a back room, you know -- what you would see in the movies, essentially.""And movies are an apt metaphor as what Moneymaker achieved was the stuff of legend, usually dreamt up by Hollywood scriptwriters.His victory even coined a phrase: The Moneymaker Effect. In essence, the rapid expansion of online poker players who, inspired by Moneymaker, competed in tournaments against experienced professionals, hoping to make serious money of their own.Television coverage played a part, as the innovative use of cameras showing the 'hole' cards -- the two starting cards with which a player begins each hand -- removed much of the mystery, transforming it into something resembling a sport itself.And never mind 839 players: in 2019, the field of 8,569 players was reportedly the second-largest in WSOP history. The live WSOP was not held last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but a return to physical action this year finds 6,650 entries, with a prize pool of more than $62 million.For a while, Moneymaker rolled back the years and went fairly deep into the 2021 tournament, eying a second WSOP bracelet, but eventually exiting in a respectable 260th place, netting $38,600.'The Bluff of the Century'Back in 2003, the then 27-year-old Moneymaker embarked on a run where, fueled by Red Bull and water, he knocked out some of the biggest names in the game -- a sports David and Goliath tale for the ages.Certain hands have since become the stuff of legend, notably the flush (all five cards from the same suit) which knocked out the legendary Johnny Chan, whose own flush of hearts lost because Moneymaker's included the all-conquering ace.Moneymaker dispatched the great Phil Ivey in a rollercoaster of a hand, where at one point Moneymaker looked certain to win, then lose, before yet another ace got him out of trouble, and sent Ivey packing.And when it was Moneymaker against Farha to decide the title, a monumentally brave bluff saw Moneymaker go all in, meaning he was essentially willing to bet his tournament life on nothing more than the high card of a king.Farha didn't just have the upper hand in every sense -- a pair of nines -- but knew it. ""You must have missed your flush draw, huh?"" Farha says at one point.The issue was that if his read of the situation was incorrect, Farha would have been eliminated and thus decided to fold. ESPN announcer Norman Chad described Moneymaker's move as ""the Bluff of the Century.""And so to that final hand. Moneymaker's five of diamonds and four of clubs were inferior compared to Farha's jack of hearts and 10 of diamonds, but another miracle took place when the flop of three community cards was revealed by the dealer.Not only did Moneymaker match his own cards with a five of spades and four of clubs to give him two pair, but Farha actually had top pair with the jack on the board, which made it appear he was in a better position.This time, Farha would go all in, which was an easy call for Moneymaker. The turn card produced an eight of diamonds, and the fifth and final river card was a five of hearts, to secure victory and give Moneymaker a full house in the process. ""This is beyond fairytale. It's inconceivable!"" exclaimed Chad.Nearly 20 years on, Moneymaker can seemingly recall every moment. ""When you could see an amateur like me pull off a bluff like that, it gave everybody hope that they could do it too,"" he says in reference to the so-called ""Bluff of the Century.""When it is put to him that his critics have said he simply got lucky, Moneymaker doesn't necessarily object, but adds one important caveat.""You can't win a poker tournament without getting lucky. That's just part of the game. But you have to put yourself in position to be lucky though, too. That's what makes the game so good. If the best player won every single time, no one would play.""",2

370," (CNN)Iceland may seem like an unlikely golfing power. With short summers and harsh winters, this island in the North Atlantic Ocean isn't the most obvious location for manicured fairways and greens. However, Iceland is experiencing a golfing boom unlike almost anywhere else in the world and the golfing culture here could help to reshape the sport as we know it.Situated half an hour's drive north of the capital city Reykjavik is Brautarholt Golf Course. Laid out across a dramatic cliff-lined peninsula, Brautarholt is the brainchild of founder Gunnar Palsson. ""This used to be agricultural land, but that had been declining,"" Palsson tells CNN Sport. ""This land has been in the family for hundreds of years and there were some generational shifts and we decided to build a golf course."" READ: Leona Maguire: the 26-year-old who shocked the golf world as unbeaten Solheim Cup rookieDo courses need 18-holes? Opening originally as a nine-hole course in 2011 before expanding to 12, Brautarholt was designed by renowned Icelandic architect Edwin Roald. Roald has attracted plenty of attention in recent years with his ""why 18-holes?"" movement, a philosophy that suggests golf course design would be improved if architects worked to create the best course for the space they have, rather than cling onto the ""antiquated"" notion that every course must be 18-holes long.""When you have limited resources, you are forced to use what nature has given you,"" Roald told Links magazine in 2017. ""If only you could break away from the constraints of having someone else tell you how many holes you must build. ""It is the same as writing books, or making movies. Imagine if all books had to be exactly 200 pages, or a film had to last 95 minutes. Would they be as good?""Despite comprising of only 12 holes, Brautarholt has been internationally recognized as one of the world's finest courses. In 2020, it was ranked No. 64 in a list of the World's Top-100 courses by Golfscape, alongside the likes of Pebble Beach and St. Andrews.A blueprint? With a short golf season in Iceland and long winters, golf clubs in the country are looking to find innovative ways of extending the season and making golf accessible to youth players all year round. The Iceland men's football team made headlines around the world for their exploits at the European Championships in 2016, reaching the quarterfinals and qualifying for their first World Cup in 2018. The women's team also qualified for three consecutive European championships from 2009 to 2017 having never previously qualified for a major tournament.Much of the national team's remarkable success has been attributed to the country's investment in state of the art, indoor facilities and excellent coaching, a blueprint that may end up being replicated in golf. The GKG Club in Reykjavik is one of Iceland's largest golf clubs, comprised of an 18-hole course plus a nine-hole, par-3 course. With a thriving junior program and active membership, the club has recently invested in a state of the art $10 million indoor facility to allow members to practice throughout the year.Situated beneath the clubhouse, the indoor facility consists of a putting green, chipping area and 16 Track Man golf simulators, allowing users to play approximately 100 courses from around the world. Ulfar Jonsson is GKG's Sporting Director and has seen firsthand the impact the facility has made. ""We see our younger players are getting technically more advanced and better. So we're seeing better swings.""We encourage obviously all our players to play as much as they can out on the course over the summertime, but then they can come in here and work on the technique during the winter."" Having had limited success on the world's biggest tours, Haukur Orn Birgisson -- the president of the Icelandic Golf Union and the European Golf Association -- believes that the investment in facilities like the one at GKG could lead to results for Icelandic players at the highest level.""When you think about it, we have a golfing season that spans for about five, six months. So having indoor practice facilities means a lot and with new technology, these facilities have become so advanced. GKG is a perfect example of that. So now you have club members playing golf in wintertime, albeit indoors and in simulators, but it's important for their development. ""It's important for the junior development as well. You can look at football, for example. Fifteen years ago, they started having these indoor football facilities and a few years later, our national teams qualified for the European Championship and the World Cup. So there you go, it's important,"" he says. The facility at GKG has also provided a valuable social element to the club. ""Now, we have an all-year facility -- before, it was mainly a summer sport ... Now, all the golfers come in and they're playing with their friends in the simulators, enjoying a meal and a drink afterwards. So it's been fantastic for the morale of the club,"" Jonsson explains. SustainabilityAs well as being acknowledged as one of the finest courses to play, Brautarholt is also looking to become the most sustainable golf course on the planet. ""Here in Iceland, more or less all of our energy is renewable, so we thought it would be a good idea to move in that direction here,"" Palsson explains. Having embraced hydro and geothermal energy, nearly 100% of Iceland's electricity comes from renewable sources. Looking to take advantage of the country's clean energy, Palsson has invested in a fleet of 30 automated electric mowers.READ: The world is banking on giant carbon-sucking fans to clean our climate mess. It's a big risk.""We're at a point now where mowers running on electricity take care of approximately 98% of the golf course,"" Palsson says.Managing the fleet of small, orange mowers is the job of course manager and head green keeper Einar Jonasson. ""Yes, our little friends. They are just a different way of thinking of cutting the grass."" With a series of cables laid out around the course, the mowers are programmed to stay on the fairways and can be in action around the clock. As well as providing an environmental benefit, they have also allowed Jonasson to concentrate on other elements of course maintenance. In addition to a carbon footprint that is close to zero, Brautarholt is also maintained without the use of chemicals and with Iceland's year-round rainfall, there is little need for any irrigation. ""Our golf course is in a spectacular location and visitors come here to enjoy that nature. We don't want to harm the environment in the anyway possible, so we don't care if you see any weeds in the fairway, we don't want to harm anything,"" Jonasson explains.Having recently invested in a state of the art, electric, ride-on-mower for tees and greens, Brautarholt is looking to set a new, sustainable standard for golf course management.""I think we are the greenest golf course in the world,"" Palsson says with pride.  One of a kindDespite Iceland's population of less than 400,000, the country is home to a remarkable 65 golf courses -- and among them are some of the most spectacular courses you're likely to find anywhere in the world. ""I would encourage everyone to come to play here,"" says Birgisson.  ""The nature here is second to none ... When you play golf in Iceland, you get to experience that nature as well. You can play golf in lava fields, you can play golf in volcanic craters, on the banks of glacier rivers, with hot springs blowing up like Geysir right next to you with water hazards that are made out of boiling water. You can't get closer to nature while playing golf."" With the country situated almost equidistant to the US and Europe, is there any chance of one of golf's major tours taking a tournament to Iceland in the future?""One day, it could be possible. Imagine a PGA Tour event being played in the midnight sun that we have here in June and July, it would be fantastic,"" says Birgisson. Bright futureGiven the standard of the courses in Iceland, it's little wonder that golf has experienced huge growth in the country and now ranks as one of the most popular sports. ""Golf has risen enormously over the past 10-15 years, and we've actually almost tripled our numbers in the past two decades,"" says Birgisson, ""But the last two years have been explosive and now we have over 6% of the entire population that are actually members of a golf club.""But at the same time, we have probably about 40,000 that actually play golf. So 12% of the population plays golf and that I think that's -- that must be a world record.""Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos""It's also worth mentioning that the level of female participation has arisen from 10% to 33% in that time,"" he adds.With participation continuing to grow and innovative new courses and facilities, Iceland is quickly becoming one of the most exciting golfing destinations in the world. With momentum on his side, Birgisson is confident that things are just getting started.""We couldn't be happier, it's safe to say that the future of Icelandic golf is looking very bright.""",2
371," (CNN)The World Golf Hall of Fame has created the Charlie Sifford Award which will be presented to individuals for ""their spirit in advancing diversity in golf.""Sifford was golf's first Black professional player and is a key reason why Tiger Woods got into the game, according to the 15-time major winner.""He's like the Grandpa I never had,"" Woods said after a practice round in advance of the 2015 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines, the day after Sifford's death.""It's been a long night, and I'm sure it will be a long few days. He fought, and what he did, the courage for him to stick with it and be out here and play.""I probably wouldn't be here (without Sifford). My dad would never have picked up the game. Who knows if the clause would still exist or not? But he broke it down.""Sifford began playing professional golf in 1948, but -- because of the so-called ""Caucasian only"" clause which blocked Black players from playing with their White counterparts -- had to settle for playing in Black-only competitions. The PGA Tour dropped the clause in 1961 thanks largely in part to Sifford becoming the first Black player to play on the Tour.And on the anniversary of his induction into the Hall of Fame in 2004, the organization announced the award named after Sifford. In the statement released by the Hall of Fame, it said the award will honor ""an individual who personifies Sifford's groundbreaking achievements through perseverance, confidence, respect and adaptability.""Charles Sifford, Charlie's son, said his family is immensely proud and honored"" about the establishment of the award. ""My father, my No. 1 hero, simply wanted to play the game he loved so much and -- in this pursuit -- endured enormous challenges as an African American golfer,"" Sifford said. ""His skills, perseverance, grit, and determination propelled him to continue his dream. He was successful despite having to overcome multiple barriers of discrimination.""The inaugural recipient of the Charlie Sifford Award will be Renee Powell.""His hard-fought efforts paved the way for other minority golfers to pursue their career,"" added Charles Sifford.""This award is honorably illuminated by having a longtime family friend and successful African American female golfer, Renee Powell, as the first recipient. This really is something special.""Powell competed in more than 250 professional tournaments, playing as a member of the LPGA Tour from 1967 to 1980 and since 1995, she has served as the head professional at Clearview Golf Club in Ohio, which her father, William Powell, established in 1946 as the first US golf course designed, built, owned and operated by an African American.The club's Clearview Legacy Foundation (nonprofit) focuses on education, preservation, and research, utilizing golf as a tool to reach everyone, with an emphasis on youth, minorities, veterans, seniors and other underrepresented groups.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosPowell will receive her award as part of the Hall of Fame's 2022 induction ceremony on Wednesday, March 9, during the Players Championship.In what will be a fitting moment, as Sifford's memory is honored with his own award, Woods will be also inducted into the Hall of Fame as part of the 2022 class. Four-time major winner Susie Maxwell Berning, former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and Marion Hollins, one of the only female golf course developers in history, will also be inducted",2
372," (CNN)For Alexis Ohanian last summer, it started with a simple phone call. The entrepreneur and co-founder of Reddit was in London and his friend wanted him to come to Paris, ""He's like, you're an idiot if you don't come down to watch the USA play France.""Shortly afterwards, Ohanian was alongside 45,000 other fans, watching Megan Rapinoe score twice for the US women's national team in the quarterfinal of the Women's World Cup, leading her country towards what would be a fourth world title.  ""It was admittedly the first time I'd ever been to a women's football match,"" he told CNN Sport, ""and the crowd was electric. I walked away from it thinking, how did I not pay this enough attention? How did I not even know there was a pro league back in the States?"" A few days later, he and his wife, the tennis legend Serena Williams, were watching the tournament final on television. Their young daughter Olympia was running around wearing the jersey of one of the team's star players, Alex Morgan.Out loud, Ohanian wondered about the possibility of Olympia one day playing the game professionally, but Serena cut him off.""Without missing a beat, my wife was like, not until they pay her what she's worth. And she was half joking, but not really.""In that moment, Ohanian says he felt compelled to try and make a positive contribution to the world of women's sports, ""Alright babe,"" he declared, ""challenge accepted!"" READ: Megan Rapinoe says 'we all have a responsibility to make the world a better place'Elevating womenTwelve months later, 'Angel City' has become a reality. Ohanian is a lead investor on a new Los Angeles soccer project led by the Hollywood actress and activist Natalie Portman.The National Women's Soccer League was formed in 2013 with just five teams, four have been added since and the league will hit double figures in 2021 when Racing Louisville FC join in. The following season, Angel City will make it 11 teams in the league. According to Angel City's President Julie Uhrman, the idea for this new team came during Portman's involvement with Time's Up, a movement established in 2018 to combat sexual harassment.  ""You can see that she really gets behind causes that are important to her and she does meaningful work for those causes,"" Uhrman told CNN Sport, adding: ""she wanted to take her commitment to elevate women's athletics, to address pay equity and to make it public and meaningful.""  Promoting Angel City's launch in July, Portman spoke about the challenges which have traditionally held back women's sports. She was talking on Instagram with somebody who's experienced it first hand for the last 20 years -- Williams.  ""Our team told me that only 4% of sports coverage is of women's sport,"" Portman said, ""it's insane that we're here in 2020 and it's so disproportionate.""  READ: Alexis Ohanian on being married to Serena WilliamsSwimming against the tideThe team, which doesn't have an official name yet -- Angel City is only a nickname -- and they won't play until 2022. But already it's clear that those behind the club are doing things differently.For one, the founding investors are almost exclusively women, ""I think you can count the number of clubs that are mainly owned by women on one hand and probably with only a couple of fingers,"" Uhrman told CNN, ""I mean, it's very unusual."" Listed on the club's website are the 31 founding investors and only four are men; Alexis Ohanian is one of those odd-men out.He described an early meeting with Uhrman, Portman and venture capitalist Kara Nortman, ""the three of them sat down and said, 'this is what we want to build, this is how we want to build it,' and it was really important to them from day one to have a majority women-owned team. ""I think we can talk about so many of the disparities in professional sports. And I think one of the ways we get real change is not just proving that this is an amazing business that will generate lots of money and lots of attention and lots of success, but it's also showing that every bit of how this organization is run can be different and be as, if not more successful as a result.""And not because it feels good, although it does feel good, but because it's preposterous that it is not more normal."" The club knows that they are trying to swim against the tide, and not just because they're hoping to change the perception of professional women's sport; they're also launching a club in a Los Angeles sports market that is already saturated. READ: Natalie Portman and Serena Williams are among investors behind Angel CityCrowded marketUhrman rattles off the clubs that they'll soon be rubbing shoulders with in a city famed for congestion, ""Los Angeles is a market where there is already nine professional sports teams and [collegiate] powerhouses like University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles.So even the idea of bringing another professional sports team here, the third soccer club here, is an ambitious, big idea."" But Angel City believes that their novel approach will cut through the noise, establishing a local, community, club with global appeal. ""We know women's soccer has been incredibly successful during the Olympics and World Cup,"" Uhrman says,""The question is, why is it every four years that they garner such attention? And I think the answer is because of exposure and awareness."" Behind the key investors is a supporting cast of Hollywood stars, including Jennifer Garner, Eva Longoria and Jessica Chastain, plus Serena Williams and 14 former players on the US women's national team; it's a group of women with tens of millions of followers on social media; they're going to use their collective platforms to shout it from the rooftops.  ""There's this general issue that if you can't see it,"" Uhrman says, ""You can't be it. If you can't see it, you can't follow it. [If] you can't cheer for it, you can't get your friend to become a part of it, and so there's a systemic problem that we have to fix and change."" Uhrman continues, ""We have a group of people that come from the entertainment space, the media space, sports and the technology space. We're thinking about soccer as bigger than sports, in fact we're thinking about it as entertainment."" Ohanian says the focus will be on social media storytelling to build the brand and it already seems to be working, ""tens of thousands of folks are very excited, [we've] sold out merchandise for a team that doesn't exist yet."" He compares women's soccer to e-sports, which drew a rush of investment five years ago, and has concluded that the market has massively undervalued female soccer.""These are clubs of gamers, young men who draw hundreds of millions of fans all over the world. [But] the average American does not know who the best League of Legends player is, whereas Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan are already cultural icons.""From a marketing standpoint, no offense to e-sports, they're far more marketable for brands who want to be aligned with consumer spending in this country."" In her conversation with Williams on Instagram, Portman remarked that already, Angel City has changed the conversation, ""people are starting to think about how to do this in other sports too.""  Women are standing up for and elevating other women; the sisters are doing it for themselves. It's an LA Story that could have a Hollywood ending and it's a potential game-changer for women's sports everywhere.",2
373," (CNN)There was a period during the winter of 2008 when every Saturday night Paul Newsham's Yorkshire home would sound like old telephone exchange switch room. ""That'll be someone ringing about Mason, to see if he will be playing,"" his wife Julie would say every time the phone rang. The callers were scouts, inquiring as to whether Mason Greenwood, the six-year-old who would develop into Manchester United's prodigiously talented striker, would be featuring the next day for the boys' team Newsham coached in the north of England, Idle FC. Greenwood has, clearly, always made an impression on the pitch.Since those carefree days as a lightning quick striker playing near his hometown of Bradford, the 18-year-old has become an integral member of an improving United, scoring goals, helping the team rise up the league and, over the last month, talked about as the next great English talent. He may also help United reach the Europa League final, should Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men overcome Sevilla in Sunday's semifinal. Scoring 10 league goals in an impressive debut season, Greenwood is only the third teenager to score 10 or more English Premier League goals in a single campaign.Former England captain Alan Shearer has said Greenwood could usurp him as the EPL's record scorer. According to former Liverpool player and now football pundit Jamie Redknapp, those at United who have worked with the teenager say he's one of the best the club has ever seen, while another former England star, Gary Lineker, has said it ""won't be long"" until Greenwood is selected by England manager Gareth Southgate. The list of admirers seems endless. But those who follow United closely have known about a young player called Greenwood coming through the ranks for years. Hyperbole and excitement has followed the player from a young age.'A different level to everyone else'As a six-year-old playing for Idle FC's under-7s, it was the young Greenwood's pace that stood out, recalls Newsham. Shy and small in stature, Greenwood also had an eye for goal, shooting on sight, just as he did for United post-lockdown as the team secured a lucrative Champions League spot by finishing third in the league.  A few days after his sixth birthday, Greenwood made his debut for Idle FC in a match against Silsden Football and Cricket Club, scoring all 10 goals in a 10-1 win. ""I kept having to bring him off because once you had 10 goals you had to stop the game, so I had to bring him off otherwise the game would've been over too quick,"" recalls Newsham with a chuckle. ""I'd keep bringing him off and he'd just stick by the side of my leg, looking up at me asking, 'Can I go on again yet, Paul?' He was so happy to be playing.""From the first training session, his control of the ball at that sort of age was excellent. You could tell watching him he was a totally different level to everyone else.""Greenwood's scoring ability is a natural talent honed to such an extent that Solskjaer, a man who worked with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, has described him as the deadliest finisher he has seen at such an age. He is only the fourth teenager in United's history, following George Best, Brian Kidd and Rooney, to score 17 goals or more in a season. It was at Idle's annual invitational tournament, involving youth teams in the local area, that Greenwood was set on a path that would lead to Old Trafford. Having impressed onlooking scouts, including United's, shortly after the tournament he started training at United's development centre in Halifax, Yorkshire, eventually signing for the club aged nine. ""I did speak to some scouts at that tournament, I'm sure I spoke to a Man Utd scout but I don't recollect it because there were that many coming up to me then asking about him,"" adds Newsham.""Once he went to Manchester United when he was seven, he couldn't play for us. His dad rung me to say he wasn't allowed to play anymore. I was gutted, but when you go to train with a club like that you can understand why they don't want to play local football.""Flourishing under SolskjaerGreenwood's rise has been rapid, but of no surprise to his former coach. Aged 14, United gave him a scholarship. Two years later, he was topping the scoring charts in the Under-18s Premier League (north) and being named player of the tournament at the 2018 International Cor Groenewegen Tournament. He also excelled at age group level for England, helping England's Under-18s win the four-team Limoges tournament. It was under Jose Mourinho that Greenwood made his senior debut for United, against Club America in Phoenix on a pre-season tour in the summer of 2018, but it is under Solskjaer that he has blossomed, particularly excelling once the EPL resumed in June following a 100-day pause because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is now established in the first team, scoring five times in the last eight games of the season, and returned from lockdown with a noticeably more muscular frame than the teenager who started the season on the substitutes' bench. ""That's sometimes something you see with young players, that initially you see them and there's evidence of talent, but then there's a point where they develop that extra, whether it's upper body muscle or that edge of pace, to take them away from someone,"" British sports journalist Richard Jolly tells CNN Sport. ""I guess we'll never know what would have happened without the lockdown, but he does seem to have come back from it stronger and looking ready to play every week.""What sets Greenwood apart from most other players is that he is two-footed, a rare skill acquired thanks to his father who would encourage him to practice with both feet. Twenty minutes before the start of training at United's Halifax center, Greenwood would be shooting with both feet at the bins outside the door, so the story goes. His family, who have shied away from media attention, as has the teenager himself, have been key to his rise, with his father taking him to Moss Side, a relatively deprived area of the city, to play five-a-side football to toughen him up.Poised in front of goal, he plays as if time slows when he has the ball and has already proven he can score from all sorts of angles and distances. ""He's genuinely two-footed with his finishing, he scores a good number of goals from outside the box as well as inside,"" adds Jolly. ""For those who believe in expected goals, Greenwood over-performs his expected goals to a huge extent, showing what a good finisher he is. He's not missing chances at all.""Everyone at United probably knows he's here to stay. He is one for the long term and he's much like [Marcus] Rashford, he's one of those who saved them 50 or 100 million pounds.""'Massively exciting'There needs to be some perspective, of course. At the same age, World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe was starring in the Champions League and breaking Thierry's Henry Ligue 1 scoring record. Yet, there is no denying that Greenwood is a wondrous talent. Football is a brutal business and Greenwood has already beaten the odds by making it this far -- according to Michael Calvin in his book ""No Hunger in Paradise"" only 180 of the 1.5 million boys who play organized youth football in England will become a Premier League professional. But throughout his young life, Greenwood has set himself apart from the rest. ""With Mason Greenwood, we're actually looking at a player that can be anything he wants to be,"" Mark Goldbridge, presenter for United Stand, tells CNN Sport. ""People are talking about him being up there with the likes of Neymar, Mbappe and Messi. I think that's unfair. But at 18 years of age, I remember Wayne Rooney and there are parallels in different ways, in that he's got a talent that senior, experienced Premier League clubs are struggling to shut him down when he's in full flow off both feet.""We're really, really excited about what he's going to become at Manchester United.""The praise directed at Greenwood these last few weeks has been lavish. Should he continue on an upward trajectory, he may have to become accustomed to it. ",2
374," (CNN)There hasn't been much to shout about at Manchester United over the last few years. The success enjoyed under legendary manager Alex Ferguson feels like a distant memory for a global fan base that has watched its once great club lurch from one bad decision to another. An FA Cup win in 2016 under Louis van Gaal and Europa League glory under Jose Mourinho in 2017 were two of the highlights in what's been an uninspiring period since Ferguson retired in 2013 -- and a far cry from the 38 trophies won by Scot in his 26 years at the club. The future didn't look much brighter back in January. The club, now managed by former player Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, found itself fifth in the league table by New Year.The football was poor, the atmosphere was toxic and star man Paul Pogba, once seen as the saving grace, looked set to leave as soon as he could. But, fast forward seven months, and there are now signs of new life under Solskjaer, most notably since the arrival of one Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese playmaker turned up at Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon in January and was thrown into a team lacking creativity, quality and leadership. Fortunately for his new employees, it seems Fernandes has all three of those attributes in abundance.  Since his debut at the start of the year, United had not lost a game in the league, rising up the table to finish third and qualify for next season's UEFA Champion League for the first time since the 2018-19 season. It was a remarkable feat considering the club started the campaign by making its worst start to a league season in 33 years. What's more, Fernandes brought excitement back to the red half of Manchester after years of uninspiring, and often woeful, performances. His eight league goals and seven assists demonstrate the sort of player United now has on its hands. ""He [Fernandes] told me about the league, how intense it is to play in that league,"" Porto star Danilo Pereira told CNN Sport. ""It's not a surprise for me to see the impact he's had in Manchester. I think United can return to their golden years with him and Pogba and other players.""READ: Rashford to be awarded honorary doctorate for forcing government U-turn'A really, really good signing'If such a thing as a typical Manchester United player exists, Fernandes would surely be it. A risk-taker, exciting to watch and able to cope with the extreme pressures of playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world, the attacking midfielder has become an instant hit.He's been a leader from day one; stepping up to take (and score) six penalties during his short spell at the club -- including the pivotal spot-kick against Leicester City which helped United on its way to Champions League football next season. Ex-players and pundits alike have fawned over his performances since he moved to England, where he's won the Man of the Match award in almost every game he's played. ""You can see that he's got the talent and he's not scared. He wants the ball, which I would expect from a very good player,"" former Premier League star and current Monaco player Cesc Fabregas told CNN Sport. ""But what I like is that he's intelligent in terms of moving around the pitch. He knows when to get between the lines. He knows when to go in the space when he sees that someone is available to make a chip. He arrives at the second line fantastically. ""He supports the midfield when they are building up and struggle a little bit, and when teams are putting a lot of pressure on them. ""He can play long, he can play short, little passes. He has the personality to take free-kicks and penalties. He's not scared. He doesn't hide. I think Man United made a really good choice. A really good signing.""READ: Meet the Manchester United fanatic opening a 33,000-piece museum in FinlandInstant impactAdapting to the Premier League is no simple feat. It usually takes players time to get used to the physicality and fast paced nature of the league, but it hasn't been a stumbling block for Fernandes.Although his performances in Portugal gave an indication of what was to come, such an instant impact took many by surprise. ""You looked at the player at Sporting Lisbon and clearly he was someone who scored a lot of goals and someone who created a lot of goals, but there's always a challenge as to whether they can translate that to a better league and into a new club,"" British journalist Richard Jolly told CNN Sport, adding that he saw no realistic way of United finishing in the top four without Fernandes.  ""But he's been a transformative player and a revelation in terms of how quickly he's done it, I mean it really was from day one.""You look at both the goal tallies and the assist tallies, and they're fantastic. If you could maintain that form over the entire season, that's an incredible player there."" Pogba improvement Whilst his individual brilliance is evident, Fernandes' arrival has seen the uptick in the form of players around him. The attacking trio of Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford scored at will after football returned from lockdown (the team has scored 22 goals in its last nine league games), and the likes of Pogba and Nemanja Matic have looked more settled in the midfield. Pogba, in particular, is a different player to one who was seemingly weighed down by the pressure of being the biggest star in the starting lineup.The Frenchman's relationship with the club appeared to reach rock bottom earlier this season, with constant rumors linking the midfielder with a move away from the club. Fans also grew frustrated with Pogba for spending much of the season on the treatment table after suffering two ankle injuries. When they did catch a glimpse of him on the field, he often underwhelmed.  But now, since he returned from his latest injury after lockdown, there have been early signs that a partnership with Fernandes could flourish and the World Cup winner suddenly looks more comfortable. ""I think Pogba likes to be surrounded by big players and big characters in their own right, I don't think he wants to be the only big name there, and thus have all the pressure lumped on him,"" Jolly said.""I think he probably doesn't want to be in a midfield where he's surrounded by mediocrities. I think you've seen signs already of a bit of chemistry between Pogba and Fernandes which helps, but I think he also just appreciates the element that he's playing with other quality players around him."" The new Cantona? Fernandes had been linked to a move to Old Trafford throughout 2019 and there had been disappointment when the deal wasn't completed in time for the new season. So, when the transfer got over the line in January for an initial $61 million (£47m), fans were ready to see what all the fuss was about. It's safe to say they haven't been disappointed. Mark Goldbridge, a United supporter and presenter of fan channel The United Stand, cannot wait to see how the team develops. ""I sort of liken it to what Eric Cantona did when he came to Manchester United from Leeds [in 1992] and we won our first Premier League title,"" he said. ""It was sort of the kick-start for some real success.""Now, I'm not saying Bruno Fernandes is going to lead Manchester United to the same level of success that Cantona did but he's not just one player coming in and making us great. ""It's one player that's come in and made everybody else around him better."" It's easy to forget that Fernandes has only been at the club for a matter of months but he's already established himself as a firm fan favorite -- with one particular moment, in a game against local rivals Manchester City, a defining one of his short time at the club. Fernandes got involved with a sideline feud with Pep Guardiola, resulting in the Portuguese player putting his finger to his lips and shushing the City manager. ""I think Bruno, in a very short period of time, has certainly come in and really grasped what Manchester United is all about,"" said Goldbridge.""Ultimately, there's a thin line between grasping what Manchester United is all about and actually just being somebody who loves the game, wants to play the game in the right way, and is passionate to win.""I remember his little argument with Pep when we played Man City, and the fans loved that because I think Fernandes just wants to win."" READ: Rashford, the gifted Manchester United star who became a remarkable activistAnother false dawn?Whilst United's form dropped for the final two games of the season, fans will be holding on to those encouraging signs of life and hoping this isn't yet another false dawn at the club. The third-place finish, although not befitting of the club's true ambition, must be seen as progress and attention can now turn to winning the Europa League, which is set to resume on August 5.  United face a simple task in their second-leg tie against LASK on Wednesday, leading 5-0 from the first leg and all but guaranteed a place in the quarterfinals. Although winning European football's secondary club cup competition is nothing to be smirked at, the real prize is still the Premier League. Despite all the improvements seen at the club in recent weeks, the gulf between it and the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City remains wide -- it finished 33 points behind eventual champion Liverpool this season. A productive summer in the transfer market could be just what United needs, and Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho is just one of the names being linked with a switch to Old Trafford.There had been signs of success during both Van Gaal and Mourinho's time at the club but something does feel different about United under Solskjaer.Maybe a return to its glory days aren't too far away. ""It does look more sustainable and one of the things that they're doing is they're not just beating teams but, if you look at that winning run, they've won quite a lot of those games comfortably and quite emphatically, and, quite entertainingly,"" said Jolly. ""I think what you might see next year is not necessarily United winning the league but them getting in the top four a lot more comfortably.""",2
375," (CNN)When dreams clash with reality; when life reaches a daunting crossroads; when we must decide whether to be or make history.Right now Neymar is at the crossroads.A 21st century football brand fueled by endless promise; a nouveau-riche social, commercial and cultural phenomena; a superstar who's no stranger to the scrutiny of the public eye.Yet when it comes to the bright lights of European football's biggest stage -- the Champions League -- he's trapped in a perpetual cycle of repetition.A one-time winner, yes -- but for some ably assisted by his supremely skilled South American counterparts -- Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez -- in the once famed 'MSN' triumvirate at Barcelona.On two occasions misfortune has conspired to subvert the Brazilian prodigy's chances of grabbing the competition by the scruff of the neck in the red and blue colors of Paris Saint-Germain.So here we are in 2020. Is it third time lucky? Is this Neymar's moment of truth? Three games now stand between the 'Red Pill' of European enlightenment or the 'Blue Pill' of another footnote in the 28-year-old's lengthening Wikipedia page.""This is the year that he can really redeem himself [...] These three games can change everything [...] I don't believe he's going to have another opportunity like this one,"" Brazilian football journalist Fernando Kallás tells CNN Sport.'Biggest mistake in the history of sports'Since planting their flag in the cobbled Parisians streets in June 2011, PSG's Qatari investors have made no secret of their ultimate goal -- continental supremacy.Domestically it's been an era defined by unrelenting dominance. Seven top-flight league titles and five French cups, including four trebles in six seasons.But if Europe is a combination lock, they've been interminably searching for the locksmith with the elusive key. Seven times they've tried and failed to crack the complex code -- each failure more painful and bitter than the last.""A specific timeline was set and once you get past that timeline each season it goes on it seems like PSG are getting further and further away so there's a weight of history that's bearing down,"" explains French football expert Jonathan Johnson.The world record signing of Neymar from Barcelona in August 2017 -- for a still mind-bending $263 million -- was intended to deliver that knight in shining armor.No longer the back-up singer to Messi and Suarez but now the leading performer with a license to thrill and become the best in the world.For some it was a game-changer; for Kallás it remains ""the biggest mistake in the history of sports.""READ: How billionaire owners changed European footballA love-hate relationshipReflecting this past week on the three-year anniversary of his move, the striker wrote that ""(these) came with a lot of knowledge. I've lived times of joy and some complicated ones.""His bond with supporters in the city of love has undulated its way through the full gamut of Facebook relationship statuses: From 'Married' to 'Separated' to 'It's complicated.'All with the allure of a former lover in Catalonia lingering in the background.A long drawn-out, but ultimately unsuccessful, serenade last summer to woo the Brazilian back to the Camp Nou brought simmering tensions in Paris to the boil.The love-hate dynamic around the polarizing figure was perhaps best encapsulated in the superstar's first league appearance of the 2019-20 season. Relentlessly booed for 90 minutes before delivering a sublime match-winning bicycle kick at the very death -- half the naysayers enraptured; the other half enraged.Kallás paints a picture of jury similarly split down the middle along generational lines in Brazil -- the young pretenders who adore ""the image, the smile, the tattoos"" contrasted with the old guard who are ""really concerned about him.""The Cold War in Paris has since thawed, along with the realization that going back to the future is -- for now -- not an imminent prospect.""He has shown on the pitch and off it that he's committed to the project [...] He really has to embrace the challenge of being a PSG player and achieving something, notably in the Champions League, in Paris,"" says Johnson.Whilst a new leaf may have been turned on the pitch, questions remain off it.Will the boy become a man?Neymar's personal life has -- at times -- borne the hallmarks of a gripping telenovela -- filled with intrigue, and all supported by an ensembled entourage. Last year he was cleared of wrongdoing after a Brazilian model accused the former Brazil captain of rape and assault.This year he was forced to miss a league match through injury -- two days after hosting a lavish birthday party in a Paris nightclub.Those willing him on to succeed despair: Will the boy ever become a man? ""In Brazil we have an expression that says that he (Neymar) is an endless promise [...] That he is ""Menino Neymar"" (""Baby Neymar"") -- He's not a boy [...] He needs to be in reality [...] He has to grow up,"" says Kallás, who has followed the Brazilian's trials and tribulations on and off the pitch.""When he's on the pitch he delivers [...] I have never, never heard one complaint from a coach or another player about his attitude in training, in the locker-room.""And for all the goals, assists and silverware to date, history and biology have dealt the twinkle-toed star a cruel hand -- starving him of the opportunity to have his say at the business end of European football's elite club competition.Curtailed seasons in 2018 and 2019 due to injuries coincided with dramatic exists for PSG from the round of 16 stage at the hands of Real Madrid and Manchester United, respectively.""That's what makes the remainder of this campaign so important and why he'll be under such close scrutiny,"" says Johnson.""It's make or break""The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly -- and perhaps favorably for PSG -- changed the dynamic for the finale of this year's tournament.Gone are the two-legged knockout affairs from the quarterfinal stages onwards, replaced instead by single-leg shoot outs -- all within the bubble of Lisbon.Without the departed sharpshooter Edinson Cavani and the recently sidelined Kylian Mbappé, the floor is Neymar's.First the surprise package of Atalanta awaits in the quarterfinals; Then a potential clash with the battle hardened Atlético Madrid in the semifinals and, after that, who knows in a winner-takes-all final.Whilst progress in the competition would -- according to Johnson -- ""really give the (Qatari) project the shot in the arm that it's needed after a few years of massive disappointment,"" for Kallás, this month could be the beginning of a career defining two years for the individual at the heart of the narrative.With the Brazilian's contract set to expire in 2022 and a World Cup in Qatar that same year, which is likely to be his last in a Brazil jersey, it's quite simply ""make or break.""""We always say 'This is going to be the year. No -- This is going to be the year. No -- This is going to be the year' [...] He's 28-years-old, he should be in the peak of his career but he's not [...] It's his last chance.""The telenovela has had its unforeseen plot twists, its moments of madness and its bursts of brilliance. Now it's in the hands of its lead protagonist to script its showpiece ending.",2
376," (CNN)Brazil's bright yellow jersey is a symbol that unites the country through a love of football and national pride, but over the past two years the shirt's adoption by right wing supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, who wear it at protests and rallies to show their political allegiance to the Brazilian president, is causing controversy.That famous yellow jersey was burnt into the imagination of a global audience in the 1970 World Cup. Inspired by the spelbinding performances of Pelé -- he wore the number 10 jersey  -- the yellow shirt has represented Brazil's success on the pitch and created a positive image worldwide for the past five decades.That 1970 national team also became embroiled in politics, notably ahead of the World Cup in Mexico when General Medici, the president of a nation under military dictatorship, played a key role in the removal of the coach -- Joao Saldanha -- who had overseen a perfect qualification campaign.Fast forward to 2020 and critics of Bolsonaro say the iconic yellow jersey has now become tainted by its close association to the Brazilian president. Walter Casagrande, a former footballer for the Brazilian national team and the São Paulo club Corinthians, remembers the feeling of scoring a goal while wearing the yellow jersey in his first match with the ""selecao"" in 1985.""It was a magical thing,"" Casagrande told CNN Sport, ""like an enchanted object that gave me huge emotion.""  Casagrande's sentiments lie on the left side of the political chasm separating Bolsonaro's supporters and opponents, and he feels an item he cherishes is being misrepresented.""Now I consider the Brazilian yellow jersey to have been kidnapped and appropriated by the right wing, so we cannot use it."" Casagrande said that for him the power of the yellow shirt used to be that it represented democracy and freedom.""Brazil is appearing horribly to the world right now,"" he said. ""It's the first time in my life I'm seeing the yellow jersey being used against democracy and freedom."" READ: 50 years on, 1970 World Cup-winning team remains Brazil's greatest ever'It's not about politics'As quick as the left is to criticize Bolsonaro, his supporters aren't slow to counter punch.Cosmo Alexandre, a Brazilian fighter who holds multiple world titles for Muay Thai and Kickboxing believes the left is conflating their many issues with Bolsonaro, and using the jersey as just another way to air grievances. As a Bolsonaro supporter, Alexandre brushes off accusations that the jersey's symbolism is being manipulated, and says the reason for supporters to wear a yellow t-shirt is simple: everyone in Brazil has a yellow t-shirt.He points out that supporters don't always wear the Brazilian team jersey specifically, and rallies are full of people wearing yellow t-shirts of all kinds.  Alexandre says there is a separation between the jersey's sporting reputation and associations from what it politically represents.""Around the world everybody knows about the Brazilian soccer team, so even if I go to a fight and I use the yellow soccer team shirt, everyone knows it's Brazil,"" he said. ""So it's not about politics -- it's just that the world knows about soccer in Brazil.""It may be easier for some than others to isolate football and politics in a country where football is God.Josemar de Rezende Jr. is a football fan who co-founded a Bolsonaro volunteer group in his city before the election. He said he's proud of the Brazilian team's global reputation for winning, and to him the yellow jersey ""means love for the country, leadership, achievement and pride.""READ: The mystery of the 1998 World Cup finalWhite and blue kit campaignNonetheless, the subject of the yellow jersey has become so divisive that a campaign is underway for Brazil to play in a white shirt.João Carlos Assumpção, a Brazilian journalist, filmmaker and author of ""Gods of Soccer,"" a book about the political, sociological and economic history of Brazil, is leading a campaign for the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) to abandon the yellow jersey altogether and go back to the classic white and blue kit from when the program started in 1914.CNN reached out to the CBF who responded that they choose not to comment on this matter, ""as it is a very unique issue.""""People used to love Brazilian soccer because we used to play very well,"" Assumpção said, ""and if we play well with the white shirt in 2022 I think everybody's going to buy a white shirt. It's going to be very difficult to change, but I think it's not impossible.""The white and blue jersey was deemed unlucky when Brazil lost the World Cup at home to Uruguay in 1950 so they switched to the yellow jersey, and won five World Cups wearing it -- a finals record that still stands today.Assumpção's vision for changing the color of the kit is to say to the world that Brazilians want change in the country. ""Not the changes that this government is doing,"" Assumpção clarified. On the other side of the political spectrum, the color yellow, including the yellow jersey, represents a positive change in the country. Bolsonaro supporter Rezende Jr. believes the attempt by the left to reclaim the yellow jersey is an effort to ""mischaracterize the government,"" which he describes as a ""patriotic government that represents and has support from all social classes throughout the nation.""READ: A pig's head and riot police: Football's most controversial transferRival football fans unitePolitical turmoil in the country mirrors the fierceness between inter-city football rivalries all across Brazil. Except it is not contained by city boundaries and in recent months has brought fans together. São Paulo is home to four main clubs: Corinthians, Palmeiras, São Paolo, and Santos. The rivalry between Corinthians and Palmeiras is especially intense, and in June groups from each club joined together in the streets to counter-protest Bolsonaro's supporters.  Sociologist Rafael Castilho, a Member of the Collective Corinthian Democracy  and Coordinator of the Corinthians Study Center said that for Brazil to overcome the current political situation, it will have to ""unite different ways of thinking and accept the contradictory.""Castilho explains the civic responsibility rival clubs feel to support each other and join with civil society movements, ""as the country experiences a crisis of party representation and social movements have been intimidated by police action,"" he said,  adding that ""the attitude of fans has gained sympathy because part of society feels represented by the courage of the fans.""The Corinthians have a history of mixing football and politics. In the 1980s during the pro-democracy movement called Diretas Já, the club team was led by national team leaders Socrates and Casagrande.The two intertwined football with politics when the team wore jerseys during a game in 1982 displaying the words ""VOTE on 15th,"" in an effort to motivate their fans to vote in the São Paulo state government election. Two years later the Corinthians were the center of a movement called Democracia Corintiana, which Casagrande said put more than one million people in the streets dressed in yellow.""It was a very important moment for Brazilian democracy, and this yellow jersey was central to that movement,"" Casagrande said.'I don't want communism in my country'The yellow jersey was back on the streets in the 2013 protests against ex-President Dilma Roussef and against corruption. A year before the World Cup was to take place in the South American country, conservative protesters wore shirts that represented the colors of Brazil, while leftist protesters used other colors.  Alexandre and Rezende Jr. both say that yellow is an improvement from the red t-shirts government supporters used to wear when the left was in power, alluding to an underlying support of communism. ""When Bolsonaro started running, his supporters used the yellow color to show I'm Brazilian and I don't want communism in my country,"" Alexandre said.The fight for the yellow jersey leaves some longing to reclaim a victorious past, while others push forward to create new meaning for the iconic symbol. In a country so deeply rooted in football, it's an issue that's unlikely to go away.Assumpção thinks it's only possible for the football community and Brazilians not associated with the far right to recover the jersey ""maybe in five years or 10, but not now. Not now.""",2
377," (CNN)Lyon stunned Manchester City on Saturday to qualify for the semifinals of the Champions League, winning 3-1.The French side made the perfect start, stifling Manchester City's attacking play and eventually taking the lead after 24 minutes thanks to Maxwel Cornet's inventive finish from just outside the box. In the second half, the English side cranked up the pressure, and the pressure eventually told, as Kevin de Bruyne coolly slotted home to level the score before substitute Moussa Dembélé scored two goals to see Lyon through. Lyon will face Bayern Munich in the semifinal on Wednesday, after the German side advanced to the semifinals on Friday, dispatching Barcelona 8-2. For the first time since 1990/91, and for the first time in the Champions League era, the semifinal stage will not feature any team from England, Spain or Italy. For the first time in Champions League history, it will feature two teams representing France.Belgian midfielder de Bruyne said that following another heartbreaking exit from the competition, it is ""not good enough.""""It's definitely the same stuff. I think the first half wasn't good enough,"" he told BT Sport after the game. ""I think we know that. ""We started slow, we had not many options. I think second half, we played really well. We came back 1-1, had a couple of chances and then obviously the 2-1, and then the 3-1 ends the game. It's a shame for us to go in that way. ""The game was open but they didn't really create except the two goal chances. Yeah, we need to learn. It's not good enough.""READ: 'The club needs changes' Changes on the horizon for Barcelona following Champions League humiliationSoaking up the pressureWith its star players and a big name manager, Manchester City were overwhelmingly favored to beat Lyon. But the French side had showed its resilience in its second leg against Juventus in the previous round, managing to edge past Cristiano Ronaldo and company despite having almost five months without football. And its sturdiness was put to the test from kickoff. Manchester City dominated possession from the first whistle, but failed to create any golden opportunities. And eventually Lyon's ability to counterattack produced the game's first goal. A ball played behind the City defence for Karl Toko Ekambi to run on to eventually fell to Maxwel Cornet and, with City keeper Ederson out of his goal, Cornet threaded a magnificent curling shot into the near post from about 20 yards.The rest of the first half played out just as Lyon and manager Rudi Garcia would have planned. Manchester City dominated possession without creating too many clear-cut chances while Pep Guardiola's team looked susceptible on the break.After the half-time break, the game opened up and following an attacking substitution by Guardiola, City began to create chances at will. And eventually the pressure told, as some nice footwork by England international Raheem Sterling freed him up to lay it back for de Bruyne to finish. It looked like there would only be one winner. However, Lyon's own super-sub Dembélé thought differently, latching on to a through ball near half-way and finishing under Ederson. A nervy video assistant referee check followed but after a few minutes of waiting, the goal was given. Although City was behind, it created the better chances and the best of which fell to Sterling. Some clever dribbling and a cross from Gabriel Jesus left Sterling with an open goal from just five yards out, but he sent ball skyward and over the goal. And the miss proved costly. Just 59 seconds later, Lyon had scored again, Dembélé pouncing on a poor save from Ederson to send the French club into the final four for the first time in nearly 10 years. The result means that during Guardiola's time at the club, Manchester City has failed to make it past the quarterfinal stage of the Champions League.Despite thinking that his side played well for the majority of the game, Guardiola lamented Manchester City's inability to play without errors in the Champions League. ""One day we will break this gap of the quarterfinals,"" he told BT Sport after the game. ""Except the first 25 minutes where we struggled to find out spaces to attack them more fluidly, the players, they play free.""Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos""And the last 15 minutes of the first half was good. The second half was OK, we were there. I had the feeling we were better, but you have to be perfect in this competition in one game and we weren't.""The 2019-20 Champions League semifinals will see two French teams and two German teams compete for a place in the final; the first time since 2012-13 that there are just two different nations represented at this stage.",2
378," (CNN)American youngster Tyler Adams scored a late winner to fire RB Leipzig past Atletico Madrid and into the Champions League semifinals on Thursday.The 21-year-old's deflected shot in the 88th minute was enough to reestablish the German club's lead after João Felix's penalty had canceled out Dani Olmo's opener. RB Leipzig, in its current form, was founded just 11 years ago after Red Bull's billionaire founder took over German fifth division side SSV Markranstadt and the team has been climbing the footballing ladder ever since. It now has the chance to add another chapter to its incredible story when it faces PSG in the semifinals on Tuesday -- after the French champion staged a stunning late comeback to defeat Atalanta 2-1 on Wednesday. ""Great emotions for the club and our team. As a manager you have to look forward,"" RB Leipzig's 33-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann told BT Sport after the match.""We have to prepare for the next game. There's not a lot of time to celebrate but maybe we will have a beer in the hotel then we focus on PSG.""The club (RB Leipzig) develops very fast since. We reached the Bundesliga and qualified for the Champions League three times. We're still in the Champions League. The progress is faster than usual.""READ: Borussia Dortmund digs its heels to stop Manchester United signing SanchoHistory madeAtletico Madrid may have been slight favorites going into the game against its German opponent, but the Spanish outfit failed to impress. It may have played without forward Angel Correa and defender Sime Vrsaljkowho, who both tested positive for the coronavirus, but had enough experience on the pitch to put in a better performance. The second-half introduction of Felix had appeared to give Atletico fresh impetus, but the 20-year-old's converted penalty stood for nothing in the end. With the match seemingly destined for extra-time, Adams' speculative late shot took a wicked deflection off Stefan Savic to end the tie in 90 minutes -- sending RB Leipzig into its first Champions League semifinal.Adams, who has 10 appearances for the US national team, moved to Leipzig from New York Red Bulls in January 2019. He becomes the first American to score in the Champions League quarterfinal with what was his first goal for the club.""Now it's about recovering in the right way, getting ourselves right mentally and working on the game plan,"" Adams told BT Sport after the game.""We're confident in ourselves, you saw that today.""",2
379,"The former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism was sentenced on Tuesday to a total of 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering.Tony Chung, 20, was charged with secession, under a sweeping national security law, and money laundering in October 2020 and was denied bail. Local media reported at the time that he was detained along with two others at a coffee shop close to the United States consulate by unidentified men and was believed to be preparing for an asylum application.Chung had entered a plea bargain, admitting guilt on the charge of secession and one count of money laundering and pleading not guilty to a sedition charge and another money laundering accusation.The plea led to a 25% reduction in his sentence, to 40 months for secession and 18 months for money laundering. Only three months of the latter will be served separately, resulting in a total sentence of 43 months.""He actively organized, planned and implemented activities to separate the country,"" District Court Judge Stanley Chan said.Prosecutor Ivan Cheung has said the defendant acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the US branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party.Pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were also seized from his home, the prosecutor said. The money laundering charge was related to donations he received via PayPal.Like other anti-government organizations, Studentlocalism disbanded before Beijing imposed the security law in June 2020, to punish anything it deems as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The vast majority of Hong Kong people do not support independence, but any mention of the idea is anathema to Beijing.Since the enactment of the security law, Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn, with most democratic politicians now in jail or in self-exile. Dozens of civil society organizations have folded, and some international rights groups have left the city.Chinese and Hong Kong authorities deny the security law tramples individual rights and say the legislation was necessary to restore stability after mass street protests in 2019.The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise -- an allegation that Beijing vehemently denies.",2
380," (CNN)A child has died after a man allegedly rammed his SUV through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, bringing the death toll to six, according to prosecutors Tuesday.The child was one of 16 children admitted to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, facility officials said in a news release.""With deepest sympathy and sorrow, Children's Wisconsin shares that earlier Tuesday, a child being cared for at Children's Wisconsin passed away from injuries sustained at the Waukesha parade. As family and friends learn of this loss and the name of the child is likely to become public, the child's parents have asked that their privacy be respected. They do not wish to be contacted by media at this time,"" the release said.Two children were able to go home Monday, the release said. A total of 13 children remain hospitalized, with six in critical condition three in fair condition and four in good condition, the release said.The latest death comes as Darrell E. Brooks, 39, was officially charged Tuesday with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, according to the Waukesha County District Attorney's Office. Prosecutors said they will consider a sixth homicide charge, due to the child's death.Brooks made his first court appearance to face charges Tuesday. The judge set his bail at $5 million. Brooks was arrested Sunday after police said he barreled into the Waukesha Christmas parade Sunday. Along with the six deaths, a total of 62 injured, according to charging documents. At least 18 children were also included in the number of people injured. If convicted, Brooks faces life in prison for all five charges, the charging document states. Brooks' bail was set at $5 million because the judge said he believed Brooks was a flight risk. While police said they don't believe the tragedy was an act of terrorism, new questions have emerged. LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the deadly Wisconsin paradeThe motive remains a mysteryBrooks was involved in a domestic disturbance with another person just before plowing his SUV through the parade, Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said.He said police weren't able to respond to the domestic disturbance call because reports from the parade tragedy came flooding in shortly afterward.Early indications were that Brooks was fleeing the initial incident, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the preliminary investigation findings. But there was no police chase of Brooks leading up to the parade, Thompson said. He said the motive for why he crashed into the crowd remains unclear.According to a criminal complaint describing the incident, three different officers with the Waukesha Police Department attempted to stop Brooks as he was driving. The first officer, identified in the complaint as Detective Casey, saw people jumping out of the way of the red Ford Escape. Casey stepped in front of the SUV, the complaint reads, and yelled at the driver to stop multiple times. At this point, the vehicle had been going ""at a slow speed,"" brushed Casey as he stepped to the driver's side door continuously yelling and continued toward the parade at a faster rate of speed.Further down the road, Officer Butryn saw the SUV and yelled at the driver to stop multiple times. Butryn estimated the vehicle was going about 25 mph, the complaint said. ""Officer Butryn observed the driver looking straight ahead, directly at him, and it appeared he had no emotion on his face,"" the complaint said. The SUV passed Butryn, at which point he saw the vehicle increase in speed until it reached an intersection where it appeared to stop, the complaint said. ""The vehicle then appeared to rapidly accelerate, as Officer Butryn heard tires squeal,"" the complaint read. ""At this point, it was clear to Officer Butryn that this was an intentional act to strike and hurt as many people as possible.""Butryn saw the vehicle driving in a zig-zag-like pattern, the complaint said. ""It was like the SUV was trying to avoid vehicles, not people. There was no attempt made by the vehicle to stop, much less slow down,"" one witness told an officer, according to the complaint. Butryn also saw ""bodies and objects"" flying as the vehicle drove through and he continued running after it. Officer Scholten saw the vehicle plowing through crowds as well, and shot at the vehicle three times. Both Casey and Butryn saw multiple fatalities and injuries, the complaint said. Casey saw three of the victims die at the scene. The other two were taken to local hospitals where they died, the complaint said. Doctors from the Waukesha County Medical Examiner's Office concluded the victims' cause of death to be ""multiple blunt force injuries,"" the complaint said.The suspect was out on bond for a questionable amountBrooks was released from jail less than two weeks ago after allegedly using a vehicle to run over a woman who said she was the mother of his child, court documents show.The woman survived the November 2 incident and was taken to a hospital for her injuries, according to a criminal complaint.Prosecutors filed five charges related to the incident, including obstructing an officer, second-degree recklessly endangering safety with domestic abuse assessments, disorderly conduct with domestic abuse assessments and misdemeanor battery with domestic abuse assessments.Brooks was released from jail November 11 on $1,000 bail -- an amount the Milwaukee County district attorney's office had recommended but now questions.""The State's bail recommendation in this case was inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges and the pending charges against Mr. Brooks,"" the office said in a statement Monday. ""The bail recommendation in this case is not consistent with the approach of the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office toward matters involving violent crime, nor was it consistent with the risk assessment of the defendant prior to setting of bail,"" the DA's office said.""This office is currently conducting an internal review of the decision to make the recent bail recommendation in this matter in order to determine the appropriate next steps.""Brooks was also charged with bail jumping because he was already out on bail following a July 2020 incident in which he was charged with two counts of second-degree reckless endangering safety with use of a dangerous weapon and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon, according to court documents.CNN reached out to Brooks' attorney from the 2020 and earlier November 2021 incident about the DA statement but has not yet received a response.The suspect is also a registered sex offenderQuestions about why Brooks was released on $1,000 bond came as news emerged about Brooks' criminal record in Nevada.Brooks pleaded guilty to statutory sexual seduction in November 2006, according to court and inmate records. Additional details about the case were not immediately available. CNN has been unable to identify Brooks' lawyer for this case.According to the inmate records, Brooks served his sentence in the Northern Nevada Correctional Center from March 2007 to September 2008.The Nevada sex offender registry shows Brooks is a registered sex offender in that state. Brooks also has an outstanding arrest warrant in Nevada in an unrelated case for which he was arrested and jumped bail, authorities said. The warrant was issued on August 15, 2016, for jumping bail, said Sarah Johns, Washoe County Sheriff's Office spokesperson. Johns said detectives later determined Brooks was in Wisconsin. ""However, detectives did not have viable intelligence on Brooks' exact location.""CNN has reached out to a previous attorney for Brooks, but has not received a response.Victims are still being treated at hospitalsWhile Waukesha mourns the five people killed during the parade, dozens of people are trying to recover from their injures.Authorities identified five of the six people killed as Virginia Sorenson, 79; LeAnna Owen, 71; Tamara Durand, 52; Jane Kulich, 52; and Wilhelm Hospel, 81.Another victim was identified Tuesday as Jackson Sparks, 8, according to the family's verified GoFundMe page. It is not immediately clear if Jackson Sparks is the sixth parade death mentioned by prosecutors and confirmed by Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.""This afternoon, our dear Jackson has sadly succumbed to his injuries and passed away,"" an update posted to the page said Tuesday.Sparks had undergone brain surgery Sunday evening, according to the GoFundMe page.Jackson's 12-year-old brother, Tucker, was also injured during the parade and was in the ICU at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, but according to the GoFundMe page, he was expected to be discharged Tuesday.Many of the other victims injured in the crash were transported to area hospitals, and some were still being treated as of Tuesday. A firefighter's son, who was marching with his high school band in the Parade, has just been moved out of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Intensive Care Unit, according to his father Don Tiegs. Erick Tiegs was struck by the SUV as it plowed through the parade, according to a news release by Caledonia Firefighters Association. ""He has undergone surgery to repair a broken femur. He is still being treated for other injuries, including placement of a chest drainage tube, and is continuing to be assessed for any further complications. Unfortunately, he has a long road to recovery ahead of him,"" the release said.Five dancers who were injured remain in the ICU, the Waukesha Xtreme Dance Team said in a statement on their Facebook page Tuesday.Eighteen children, ranging in ages 3 to 16, were transported to Children's Wisconsin Hospital, according to Dr. Amy Drendel, director of the hospital's emergency department and trauma center.",2
381,"Washington (CNN)Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday filed to run for reelection in Texas, officially entering what is shaping up to be one of the most high-profile contests in 2022.Abbott launched his campaign with a focus on border security and police support, saying in a video posted to his Twitter account: ""I want you to know I'm running for reelection to protect and secure our border. I'm running for reelection to support our police officers in the great state of Texas. And I'm running to make sure Texas remains a job creation machine.""The Texas gubernatorial race began to draw national attention in earnest earlier this month when Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2018 and the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, launched his campaign, which many Democrats in the state had identified as the party's only chance of denying Abbott a third term. In the two-minute video announcing his campaign, O'Rourke used the February failure of the Texas power grid during a severe winter storm to criticize Abbott's leadership, saying those without power and water were ""abandoned by those that were elected to serve and look out for them.""Democrats in Texas have said they see Abbott as politically wounded from the episode along with a string of other controversies stemming from his efforts to restrict abortion and ban government vaccine mandates. A September poll from Quinnipiac University found that 51% of registered voters in the state said Abbott did not deserve reelection. Still, turning Texas blue in a statewide race remains a tall task for Democrats, especially with President Joe Biden's lower approval ratings energizing Republicans, who hope to run against his presidency to make electoral gains in Washington and statehouses across the country. Abbott has already used O'Rourke's comments from the presidential race on issues like gun control, the Green New Deal, health care reform, immigration and the Black Lives Matter movement -- generally out of context -- in an ad series he has posted on YouTube called ""Wrong Way O'Rourke.""One wild card in the race could be actor Matthew McConaughey, who has signaled interest in launching his own campaign. ""I'm measuring it,"" he said of running for office on a podcast in September. ""Look, it's going to be in some capacity. ... I just -- I'm more of a folksy and philosopher poet statesman than I am a, per se, definitive politician.""He continued, ""So I go, well, that's a reason not to, but then I go, no, that's exactly why you should, because politics needs redefinition, but I'm measuring, you know, what is my category?

384,"New York (CNN Business)For months, OPEC and its allies refused pleas from Washington and other world capitals to pump more oil. Now, a US-led coalition of consuming nations is coming together to effectively say: Fine, if you won't act, we will.The White House announced Tuesday that India, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom are all joining the United States in the first coordinated emergency oil release in a decade. Analysts have already dubbed the group the ""anti-OPEC.""The United States alone is releasing 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It's the largest release on record and a dramatic way for the Biden administration to show it's taking aggressive action in response to high prices at the pump.The good news is that the mere rumor of this historic intervention drove oil prices down from seven-year highs. And that should translate to some relief for Americans grappling with high gas prices.But the bad news is no one -- not even the White House -- is expecting a dramatic decline in prices at the pump.The ""best case"" is that prices slide by 15 to 20 cents a gallon, according to Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group.And don't expect that to happen immediately.""It's not going to come fast and furious,"" said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.President Joe Biden acknowledged as much during his announcement on Tuesday.""While our combined actions will not solve the problem of high gas prices overnight, it will make a difference,"" Biden said. ""It will take time, but before long, you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank.""Key details of the international intervention remain unclear, including the precise amounts that major countries are contributing. The White House initially announced that China would participate, but later Biden only said China ""may do more as well.""The lack of details likely did not impress Wall Street. After initially retreating on the news, US oil prices finished the day 2.2% higher. Brent crude, the world benchmark, surged more than 3%.Unless China is stepping up with a truly massive release of barrels, this coordinated effort appears to be more of a band-aid than a game changer.The world consumes 100 million barrels a dayThe problem is the SPR won't solve the underlying issue: Oil supply hasn't kept up with surging demand as the US economy recovers from Covid. While releasing barrels from strategic reserves can help, there is a finite amount of oil in reserve. Countries can't simply release oil every month.""Releasing oil from the SPR reserve will likely not have a long-term effect on lowering gasoline prices,"" said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise, an energy investment firm.Supporters of using the SPR concede this point.""It's not going to be a panacea. But we've got to do what we can,"" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CNN on Monday after sending Biden a letter urging him to tap the SPR.It's also crucial to keep the size of the actions in context. Although the 50 million-barrel release by the United States is the biggest in US history, that's roughly what the world consumes every 12 hours.Kicking the canAnother factor is the way the Biden administration is releasing the barrels.About 18 million barrels will be an acceleration of a sale that Congress previously authorized.The rest, 32 million barrels, will be released through an exchange, or a swap. By definition, those barrels must be returned at a later date and that supply must come from somewhere. ""The market knows the barrels have to be returned. To a certain degree, it's self-defeating,"" said Mizuho's Yawger.Rystad Energy senior oil markets analyst Louise Dickson agrees.""The move by Biden and other leaders may just be pushing the supply issue down the timeline,"" Dickson wrote in a note on Tuesday, ""as emptying out storage will put even further strain on already low oil stockpiles and as these countries will eventually have to go on a buying spree to refill the strategic reserves.""Biden officials note, however, that the futures market is signaling prices will be lower next year. So they view the move as a ""bridge from today's high-price environment to a period of lower prices into the future.""The outlook for 2022Despite all of this, Biden officials felt compelled to act, in large part because high gas prices and inflation more broadly are creating anxiety for millions of Americans. And that anxiety is seriously weighing on Biden's poll numbers.Biden is as ""empathetic as anyone I've ever worked with,"" one senior administration official told reporters during a press briefing. ""Consumers are facing challenges at the pump right now. And we are trying to deal with that situation and deal with it in a smart, tailored and aggressive way."" Tom Kloza, head of the Oil Price Information Service, said the coordinated release is more than a band-aid and argued ""we might have been knocking on the door of $90"" if not for the SPR release.However, Kloza is concerned that gas prices will rise sharply in early 2022, outpacing oil prices, due to the retirement of refineries in California, New Mexico and Louisiana.""They're not coming back, and we're going to miss them,"" said Kloza. ""We're going to have a real apocalyptic spring, in my view. And it's not because of Joe Biden.""'The nuclear option'There are two main wildcards going forward.First, the White House signaled Biden may not be done just yet. ""The president stands ready to take additional action, if needed, and is prepared to use his full authorities working in coordination with the rest of the world to maintain adequate supply as we exit the pandemic,"" the White House said in its fact sheet.In theory, Biden could release even more barrels in the future. And some Democrats are calling for Biden to ban oil exports, although some experts warn that would be counterproductive because crude is a globally traded commodity. But the bigger question is how OPEC and its allies, known collectively as OPEC+, respond.The group, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, is scheduled to meet next week, and the plan was to increase production by another 400,000 barrels per day. Yet it's easy to see how these producers scrap those plans. OPEC+ could easily cite the emergency releases or the Covid lockdown in Austria as a reason why those barrels are no longer needed. ""That would be the nuclear option,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.",2
385," (CNN)Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik is demanding an apology from the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, but does intend to comply with a subpoena he has received from the panel, according to his lawyer.Kerik worked alongside his longtime friend Rudy Giuliani, a former attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the weeks after the presidential election to find any evidence of voter fraud that would swing it for Trump. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.In a Tuesday letter to select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, Kerik's lawyer Timothy Parlatore asked for additional time to comply with the panel's requests so that they can go through requested materials and sort out any potential privilege claims with attorneys for the former President.The committee subpoenaed Kerik earlier this month, in part, because it alleged he had attended a meeting at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, on January 5 in which Giuliani; former Trump adviser Steve Bannon; John Eastman, an attorney who worked with Trump's legal team; and others discussed options for overturning the election results -- such as pressuring then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the Electoral College results, among other things.Parlatore wrote to Thompson that ""Mr. Kerik never attended any such meeting.""""If you were not personally responsible for this fabrication and false statements, then someone on your staff was and should be held accountable,"" he wrote.Kerik previously confirmed to CNN that he paid for rooms and suites in Washington, DC, hotels that ""served as election-related command centers,"" according to the committee.In February, Make America Great Again PAC, the successor organization to the Trump presidential campaign, made two large disbursements for ""recount travel expenses,"" according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. The PAC paid Kerik's company and Giuliani's company $66,251.54 and $76,566.95, respectively.The Tuesday letter also outlined Kerik's complaints about a press release issued by the committee along with the subpoena, insisting the committee should not have claimed that Kerik worked with Giuliani to ""promote baseless litigation"" without reviewing the evidence Kerik had gathered.The former police commissioner is demanding that the press release and subpoena cover letter be withdrawn or corrected and an apology be issued, according to his lawyer.But ""notwithstanding the significant issues"" with the committee's public statements, ""Mr. Kerik still intends to comply with the subpoena,"" the Tuesday letter stated.",2
386,"New Delhi (CNN)Gulpreet Singh begs for food from a dirty hemp mat spread on the sidewalk outside Delhi's South Campus metro station.Like millions of Indians who survive on handouts or daily wages, the 84-year-old says he has no choice but to be outside, breathing air thick with smog in the Indian capital.""I come here and wait. Sometimes, people give me food,"" said Singh, his voice straining over the noise of auto rickshaws and cars belching fumes just meters away.Delhi is often ranked among the world's most polluted cities, and air pollution there reached ""hazardous"" levels in early November, according to India's National Air Quality Index (AQI), which tracks the presence of harmful particles in the air.But some Delhi residents have become so accustomed to bad air that it's a part of daily life -- they barely notice it, they say.Others say it's making them sick.Choking on smog    A police officer directing traffic at one of Delhi's busy junctions says pollution levels have become ""unbearable"" this winter.""I've taken off my mask because I need to blow the whistle to stop traffic, but it's been horrible,"" said the 48-year-old officer, who didn't reveal his name because he is not authorized to speak to the media.Exhaust fumes flow from the rows of vehicles around him -- he says he finds it hard to catch his breath.""My eyes hurt. It's hard to breathe. It's not easy,"" he said.Social worker Neelam Joshi, 39, says she feels the pollution every time she steps out of her house to catch the train to work.""When you leave the house in the morning, that's the first thing which hits you,"" Joshi said. By the end of the day, she says her body seems to have adjusted, but the next day, it happens all over again.""In the last six years that I have lived in Delhi, there's never been a reduction in pollution,"" she said. ""It only increases every year. Every year we reach a different level, and during festivals it always becomes worse.""Amanpreet Kaur, 28, a flight attendant from Delhi's Rohini area, recently crewed a flight from the United States and was stunned by the difference in air quality.""When I landed back into India, after my flight from USA, it was horrible. I'm continuously coughing,"" she said.Kaur says the smog is so bad that you can see it at night as a dirty haze around street lamps and car headlights.""When the sun sets, all you see is smog, just smog all around,"" Kaur said.""It's very dangerous to live in Delhi.""'My right to breathe'Aditya Dubey, an 18-year-old environmental activist, has spent the past two years lobbying for urgent action against Delhi's pollution.Every year, the city is plagued by a throat-searing cloud of murky smog, but it's worse in winter when lower temperatures and a drop in wind speed trap particles in the air for longer.""Winter has become a torture and every day feels like a punishment,"" Dubey said. ""I have a burning sensation in my eyes and they start watering. I feel breathless.""Last month, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tried to control pollution levels by banning firecrackers for Diwali, the festival of lights, but celebrations mostly proceeded as normal.The smoke from Diwali was exacerbated by a spike in the burning of crop waste in surrounding farmlands.By November 5, most locations in Delhi were recording an AQI above 500 -- the highest level on the scale.At that point, Dubey had had enough.The activist filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking protection for his ""right to breathe.""On November 15, the court ruled in his favor and ordered the central government to do more. Subsequently, schools were shut, non-essential traffic was suspended, construction projects were halted, and six out of 11 coal-fired plants were ordered to close until the end of November.Construction projects resumed Monday as Delhi recorded a marginal improvement in air quality. But for many, the damage had already been done.The 'silent killer'Delhi is not the only Indian city choked by smog.Last year, nine of the world's 10 most polluted cities were in India, according to monitoring network IQAir.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths a year globally, mainly as a result of increased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory infections.Bad air could be reducing the life expectancy of hundreds of millions of Indians by as much as nine years, according to a recent study by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).The study also found that every single one of India's 1.3 billion residents endure annual average pollution levels that exceed guidelines set by WHO.In 2019, the central government announced a national clean air campaign, with an aim to reduce particulate pollution by up to 30% by 2024. Specific plans were created for each city; in Delhi, those plans included measures to reduce road traffic, burn-offs and road dust, and to encourage the use of cleaner fuels.But in the past few years, India's pollution problem has worsened, partly due to the country's dependency on fossil fuels -- and in particular, coal.At the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, India was among a group of countries that pushed for an 11th-hour amendment to the agreement to phase ""down"" coal rather than phase it ""out"".In Delhi, noxious air is claiming tens of thousands of lives each year, according to analysis of IQAir data by Greenpeace.But despite the worsening air quality, some Delhi locals have become so accustomed to it they don't seem to notice.Many roam the streets without a face mask and have developed a general complacency toward pollution levels.Omprakash Mali, a 50-year-old gardener, say the air pollution doesn't affect him or his work.""We work with mud and in dust as a gardener, so I don't feel anything additional,"" he said. ""I think the top priority for the government should still be Covid-19. Pollution happens every year.""Meanwhile, Shesh Babu, 18, a manual laborer, said he ""doesn't really care"" about Delhi's thick smog. His priority is earning money.Dubey, the activist, says air pollution is considered to be an ""elitist"" issue.""Air pollution is a silent killer,"" he said. ""There is a lack of awareness. People don't realize the seriousness of it.""",2
387,"Washington (CNN)Democrat Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2018 and the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, announced last week that he is running for Texas governor in 2022.Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who announced Tuesday that he had filed to run for reelection, started attacking O'Rourke as radical and out of touch even before O'Rourke made his gubernatorial candidacy official. In a 30-second video ad released online in late October, Abbott's campaign drew attention to comments O'Rourke made on a podcast in June 2020 on the subject of the ""defund the police"" movement. Or, rather, Abbott's campaign drew attention to an altered version of O'Rourke's comments. Facts First: In three important ways, the Abbott ad deceptively edited O'Rourke's words about policing to try to make him sound more extreme. The ad's first deceptive edit deleted key O'Rourke words to make it sound like he had issued a broad, unreserved endorsement of Black Lives Matter activists for bringing attention to the idea of defunding the police. O'Rourke's actual words were narrower: he praised the activists for bringing attention to the idea of defunding ""line items that have overmilitarized our police.""The second deceptive edit deleted key words to make it sound like O'Rourke had called for ""dismantling"" police departments, end of story. He had actually called for dismantling ""and rebuilding"" departments in ""some necessary cases.""The third deceptive edit was especially egregious. This one mashed together phrases from three different O'Rourke sentences. The stitch job made it sound like an O'Rourke comment about the importance of Black Lives Matter activism, and how it is part of a tradition of civil rights activism, was a comment about the importance of defunding the police and dismantling police departments.  For emotional effect, the ad juxtaposed O'Rourke's altered words with a series of video clips of rioting and looting.The Abbott campaign's edits are extra notable because O'Rourke's actual, unedited comments in the June 2020 interview gave Republicans ample attack ammunition. Other O'Rourke opponents have highlighted his words about policing without altering them. Among other comments on policing, O'Rourke praised the city council of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for a decision that month to move toward dismantling the local police department and replacing it with a ""Department of Community Safety."" (Minneapolis voters rejected this idea when it was on the ballot earlier this month.) And because there is no single agreed-upon definition of what counts as ""defunding the police,"" Abbott could have tried to make an argument that O'Rourke's positive words about the notion of defunding certain police ""line items"" is evidence that he had supported the ""defund"" movement.But the Abbott ad did not include O'Rourke's comments about Minneapolis. And on police defunding, the ad sliced and diced O'Rourke's words instead of letting Texans evaluate them for themselves.Abbott campaign spokesman Mark Miner declined on Monday to directly address CNN's questions about the distortions in the ad, which the campaign promoted on Twitter last week. Miner said only: ""Beto O'Rourke clearly supports dismantling and defunding the police and he will need to explain his anti-law enforcement policies to the people of Texas.""O'Rourke campaign spokesman Joe Bowen said on Monday, ""Beto does not support defunding the police."" According to Texas Tribune political correspondent Patrick Svitek, O'Rourke told reporters last Wednesday, ""I don't think I've ever advocated for defunding the police.""We'll look at O'Rourke's position a little later. First let's walk through how the Abbott ad crafted its deception.The ad deleted essential wordsAfter showing clips of masked protesters, smoke on a street and a car on fire, the Abbott ad shows O'Rourke on camera saying: ""I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund..."" Then the screen cuts to a stylized shot of a man's moving mouth as O'Rourke's voice says, ""Completely dismantling those police forces.""But this is not a sentence O'Rourke actually uttered. In fact, the ad deleted two sets of important words, then strung the remaining words together to alter their meaning.Here's what O'Rourke said. The bolded words are the ones that the ad left out.""So I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund, you know, these line items that have overmilitarized our police, and instead invest that money in the human capital of your community, make sure that you have the services, the help, the support, the health care necessary to be well and not require police intervention. And then also in some necessary cases, completely dismantling those police forces and rebuilding them."" The ad moved a key phrase from one sentence to anotherThe end of the ad features O'Rourke's voice -- over video clips of rioting and looting -- saying this: ""Defund, dismantling police forces, it's the only way that things get better.""But that is not a sentence O'Rourke uttered either.So where did the supposed quote come from? The Abbott campaign was unwilling to explain, but it appears that the campaign took three separate O'Rourke remarks from the June 2020 interview and stitched them together as if they were one.O'Rourke made his comment about defunding certain police line items around the 34:46 mark of the podcast. About 30 seconds after that, he made his comment in favor of dismantling certain police forces and rebuilding them. It wasn't until more than a minute after that -- a full minute and a half from the ""defund"" comment -- that he uttered the words ""it's the only way that things get better."" And the context for these words was much different than the ad suggested. Here's the real context.O'Rourke praised the Minneapolis decision to move toward dismantling and replacing the police department, saying the only solution for such a problem-plagued department is ""completely dismantling that system and rebuilding it intentionally with the community members at the table."" He said that this notion might seem dangerous to some people but that ""any major change"" in US history has seemed dangerous to some. He noted that the activism of civil rights movement icon John Lewis and fellow Freedom Riders was dangerous to the status quo. Then O'Rourke said: ""So let's look at Black Lives Matter in that same context and from that same perspective. What they are doing right now is a very proud and necessary tradition of civil rights, and it's the only way that things get better.""The Abbott ad seems to have moved this quote -- ""it's the only way that things get better"" -- to an entirely different sentence with an entirely different meaning.O'Rourke's current positionWhen CNN asked O'Rourke's campaign on Monday for his current position on defunding the police, spokesman Bowen said he does not support it and never has. Again, O'Rourke himself said Wednesday, ""I don't think I've ever advocated for defunding the police.""Because of the haziness of the phrase ""defunding the police,"" O'Rourke's comments in the 2020 interview leave an opening for people to argue either way. Defenders of his position can accurately note that he didn't make a general call for all kinds of police funding to be removed. Opponents can accurately note that he spoke positively of taking away certain police funding and of dismantling (and rebuilding) some police departments.Bowen said that O'Rourke believes that police departments in Texas are now solving a lower percentage of violent crimes than they did when Abbott took office in 2015 because the departments are overburdened ""with responsibilities that may not require a law enforcement response."" ""We should allow other departments and community supports to respond to those challenges in order to allow police forces to focus on their most important job for public safety: addressing violent crime,"" Bowen said. O'Rourke said Wednesday, in the comments reported by Svitek of the Texas Tribune, that he doesn't want law enforcement to have to deal with ""issues where it's more of a mental health care challenge and incident that could be addressed with a social worker or someone who's not in law enforcement.""CNN asked Bowen if O'Rourke believes that some money should be taken away from police budgets and reallocated to these ""other departments"" that would handle the work O'Rourke thinks should be taken away from the police. Bowen said, ""That's a false choice. We cannot guarantee the safety of our communities focusing on one or the other, we must do both. We must invest in these additional services so that police departments can focus their resources on preventing and solving crime.""",2
388,"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN)A jury has awarded more than $26 million in damages after finding the White nationalists who organized and participated in a violent 2017 rally here liable on a state conspiracy claim and other claims.But the jury in the federal civil trial said Tuesday it could not reach a verdict on two federal conspiracy claims.The violence during the Unite the Right rally turned the Virginia city into another battleground in America's culture wars and highlighted growing polarization. It was also an event that empowered White supremacists and nationalists to demonstrate their beliefs in public rather than just online.Though the jury deadlocked on the two federal conspiracy claims, it slammed the defendants on the other claims with major awards to the plaintiffs, who included town residents and counterprotesters injured in the violence four years ago.Some of the most prominent figures of the alt-right -- Jason Kessler, Matthew Heimbach, Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell -- were among the defendants.""We are thrilled that the jury has delivered a verdict in favor of our plaintiffs, finally giving them the justice they deserve after the horrific weekend of violence and intimidation in August 2017,"" plaintiffs' attorneys Roberta Kaplan and Karen Dunn said. ""Today's verdict sends a loud and clear message that facts matter, the law matters, and that the laws of this this country will not tolerate the use of violence to deprive racial and religious minorities of the basic right we all share to live as free and equal citizens.""One defense attorney called the verdict a win.""It's a politically charged situation. It's going to be hard to get 11 people to agree,"" said attorney Joshua Smith, who represented three defendants. ""I consider a hung jury to be a win, considering a disparity of resources.""The events surrounding August 11-12, 2017, saw White nationalists and supremacists marching through Charlottesville and the University of Virginia campus chanting, ""Jews will not replace us,"" ""You will not replace us"" and ""Blood and soil,"" a phrase evoking Nazi philosophy on ethnic identity. The violence -- which enveloped the rally to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee -- reached a crescendo when James Alex Fields Jr., who was protesting the statue's removal, sped his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Half of the $24 million in punitive damages awarded were against Fields. In addition, the jury awarded punitive damages against Kessler, Spencer and Cantwell at $700,000 each, and Heimbach for $500,000.Despite the large jury award, there's the question of whether the plaintiffs will see much of that money. Fields is serving multiple life sentences. Some of the other defendants -- individuals and White supremacist organizations -- have indicated they are financially stressed.""The defendants in the case are destitute, none of them have any money,"" Smith said. ""I don't know how any of the plaintiffs are going to get anything for any of this."" Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they intend to relitigate the two federal conspiracy charges.The first federal conspiracy claim was the most prominent against the defendants because it alleged the defendants conspired to commit racially motivated violence while the second alleged the defendants had knowledge of a conspiracy and failed to prevent it.""We intend to get a verdict on those counts in the future,"" Kaplan said.Amy Spitalnick, executive director for Integrity First for America, the group that funded the suit, called the multimillion dollar decision a message.""This verdict sends a very clear message that violent hate will not go unanswered,"" Spitalnick said. ""There will be very serious consequences for the sort of extremist violence we saw here four years ago. And that's incredibly powerful, particularly at a moment when we know that extremism is on the rise, when democracy is under threat, and when there has been so little accountability.""Millions in damages awardedA jury awarded the plaintiffs $11 million in punitive damages on a Virginia conspiracy claim. On that claim, each defendant is liable for $500,000 each. Five organizations are liable for $1 million each.The jury only awarded $7 to the plaintiffs in compensatory damages on the civil conspiracy claim.In general, compensatory damages compensate (or make whole) the injured party for their loss or injury. Punitive damages are considered punishment when the defendant's behavior is found to be particularly harmful, such as if the defendant intentionally engaged in willful misconduct.  For the claim that some defendants subjected plaintiffs to racial, religious or ethnic harassment, violence or vandalism, Kessler, Spencer, Cantwell, Elliott Kline and Robert ""Azzmador"" Ray were each found liable for punitive damages.Plaintiffs Natalie Romero and Devin Willis were awarded $250,000 each in compensatory damages.In the same claim, the jury also found Fields liable, but did not award any damages.It also found Fields liable for $12 million in punitive damages total for claims of assault or battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Jurors awarded $803,277 in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs for the assault or battery claim. On the other claim, the jury awarded $701,459 in compensatory damages.Fields didn't testify in the trial but was represented by an attorney.Lawsuit sought long-awaited consequencesA few criminal cases resulted from the events surrounding the rally -- including state and federal convictions of Fields, who is serving multiple life sentences for killing Heyer -- but there were no large-scale trials of organizers from the Justice Department under the Trump or Biden administrations.The civil lawsuit in federal court sought to impose consequences on those who planned the rally and Fields for the people he injured or traumatized when he ran his Dodge Challenger into the crowd. But even before the trial, the plaintiffs had won in some ways due to the national outrage over the violence. Richard Spencer stopped his public speaking tour and has called the case ""financially crippling."" Jeff Schoep and Heimbach renounced White supremacy and stopped organizing White power activity in public. Schoep gave the group he led for more than two decades, the National Socialist Movement, to a Black civil rights activist who died shortly thereafter. Identity Evropa, one of the groups named in the suit, rebranded under a new name twice before disbanding. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that even though the full verdict amounts likely won't be paid, the lawsuit will brings significant consequences. He compared the verdict with a decision in the 1980s in which a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center crippled the Ku Klux Klan.""It is a significant verdict,"" Toobin said of Tuesday's decision. ""It is important to realize as one of the defense attorneys said that these defendants don't have millions of dollars and they won't pay millions of dollars. But they will face consequences and they will face the prospect of having wages garnished, property taken.""Fourteen people and 10 White supremacist and nationalist organizations were originally named in the lawsuit that prompted the trial, but a few were not involved in the verdicts because they didn't show up for court and were the subjects of default judgments. In closing arguments last week, attorneys representing the plaintiffs told the jury that the defendants prepared for the ""Battle of Charlottesville"" and messages sent between them and their actions after the violence were proof of a conspiracy. Defense attorneys and Spence and Cantwell, represented themselves countered that none of the plaintiffs had proven the defendants had organized racial violence. The case was Sines v. Kessler.",2
389," (CNN)After spending 43 years behind bars for a crime he said he didn't commit, a Missouri man's conviction has been set aside, according to a news release from Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker. Senior Judge James Welsh filed his ruling Tuesday morning to set aside the conviction of 62-year-old Kevin Strickland, who served 43 years at Western Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri, after he was convicted of one count of capital murder and two counts of second-degree murder in a triple homicide. He received a 50-year life sentence without the possibility for parole for a crime he maintained he wasn't involved in.Strickland, from a wheelchair, spoke shortly after he was released from jail Tuesday afternoon and said he's thankful for his attorneys and everyone who listened to him over the years while he maintained his innocence. All criminal counts against Strickland were dismissed. His release makes his confinement the longest wrongful imprisonment in Missouri history and one of the longest in the nation, according to The National Registry of Exonerations.""Still in disbelief,"" Strickland said. ""I didn't think this day would come.""Strickland said he found out the news of his release through a breaking news report that interrupted the soap opera he was watching.""To say we're extremely pleased and grateful is an understatement,"" Peters Baker said. ""This brings justice -- finally -- to a man who has tragically suffered so, so greatly as a result of this wrongful conviction."" Strickland testified during a three-day evidentiary hearing earlier this month -- which involved eyewitness testimony given under oath -- Strickland's legal team presented evidence and arguments to exonerate him.Four people were shot in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 25, 1978, resulting in three deaths, according to CNN affiliate KSHB. The only survivor of the crime, Cynthia Douglas, who died in 2015, testified in 1978 Strickland was at the scene of the triple murder.Douglas survived the shooting after sustaining a shotgun injury and told police Vincent Bell and Kiln Adkins were two of the perpetrators. But she did not identify Strickland, who she knew, at the scene until a day later, according to KSHB, after it was suggested to her Strickland's hair matched Douglas' description of the shooter. Douglas claimed her initial failure to identify him was due to the use of cognac and marijuana, according to KSHB.But over the past 30 years she said she made a mistake and falsely identified Strickland. According to KSHB, Douglas made efforts to free Strickland through the Midwest Innocence Project.The two assailants Douglas identified at the scene both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and each ended up serving about 10 years in prison for the crimes, according to Strickland's attorney, Robert Hoffman.""Most of us have heard the famous quotation that 'injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'"" Peters Baker said in an online statement posted in August. ""Kevin Strickland stands as our own example of what happens when a system set to be just, just gets it terribly wrong.""Strickland thanked the judge for reviewing all the ""non evidence"" against him and he appreciated the judge taking his time to listen and understand what really happened in 1978.Eventually Strickland said he wants to get involved in speaking and possibly influencing legislation, and added he has ideas on how to keep this from happening to someone else.A GoFundMe account has been set up by the Midwest Innocence Project to help him restart his life. They note the State of Missouri will provide no compensation for the time he spent in prison.In 2020, there were 129 exonerations nationwide. Defendants exonerated last year lost a total of 1,737 years behind bars, an average of 13.4 years per exoneration, according to a report from The National Registry of Exonerations. And 30% of wrongful convictions in the registry's database can be traced back to mistaken eyewitness identifications.",2
390," (CNN)It should have come as no surprise the first interview Kyle Rittenhouse gave after his acquittal would go to Tucker Carlson. Rittenhouse, who claimed self-defense after fatally shooting two people and wounding another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has become a heroic figure on the right, lauded for his willingness to defend property and defend himself with deadly force during the protests.But recently, his acquittal on all charges added another layer to his status: now he also became a victim of political persecution, unjustly prosecuted by the state and viciously slandered by liberal media and Democratic politicians. That is how Tucker Carlson presented him, adding Rittenhouse to the new pantheon of right-wing victim-heroes he is building. On both his prime-time show on Fox News and his propaganda documentaries running on the streaming service Fox Nation, Carlson has become one of the most prominent promoters of the narrative now defining conservatism in the US: that right-wing violence is not a problem, that White supremacy is a hoax, and that the real threat to democracy is the Democratic-Party-Deep-State alliance. And at Fox News, where Carlson advances this narrative each night, the network has made clear they're sticking with Tucker, ensuring his indoctrination lines will be repeated across the network.In the interview with Rittenhouse aired Monday night, Carlson emphasized his belief Rittenhouse was a virtuous young man. During the pre-recorded interview, in which Rittenhouse recalled the shootings in polished detail, Carlson not only underscored the righteousness of the teen's actions, but showed a soft spot for Rittenhouse himself. He introduced Rittenhouse as ""bright, decent, sincere, dutiful, and hardworking... exactly the kind of person you would want many more of in your country."" During the interview, he joked with Rittenhouse about their shared propensity for gaining weight, while during a break, he said to his audience, ""What a sweet kid.""Shortly after commenting on the shooter's sweetness, Carlson offered his viewers a summary of his Rittenhouse narrative: ""The picture that emerges is of a working-class kid who sincerely believes in America. His community falls apart, and he tries his best to do the right thing, at a time when almost no one else in the community is trying to do the right thing. But he does. And in return for that, the state, under political pressure, throws him in prison.""Carlson has obviously skipped over a key part of the story — where Rittenhouse killed two people. He does so to underscore his broader message to his audience: this could be you or your child. You, the person who loves your country. You, the person who wants to defend your community. You, the person who believes you're doing the right thing, even when it requires standing alone. And when you do all these things, you are at risk of being unjustly targeted by politicians and prosecutors and the Deep State.It's the same argument Carlson made just a few weeks ago on his conspiratorial documentary, ""Patriot Purge,"" his retelling of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. In it, he presented the insurrectionists as good, patriotic Americans, nonviolent protesters who had been set up by the FBI and other Deep-State forces. He warned a second War on Terror was underway, this time aimed directly at conservatives and Trump supporters. The documentary, which ran on Fox Nation, will be followed in a few weeks by one called ""The Trial of Kyle,"" drawn from hours of interviews and behind-the-scenes filming during the trial. Though Carlson remains Fox News's biggest star, not everyone on the network is on board with his conspiratorial vision of vigilante conservatism. Earlier this week, Fox News contributors and Never-Trumpers Jonah Goldberg and Steven Hayes quit the network, citing ""Patriot Purge"" as their reason. ""It traffics in all manner of innuendo and conspiracy theories that I think legitimately could lead to violence,"" Goldberg said in an interview with NPR's David Folkenflik. ""That for me, and for Steve, was the last straw.""Their departure comes nearly five years after the network went all in on Donald Trump, replacing Trump skeptics like Megyn Kelly and George Will with some of his most ardent supporters, including Carlson and Laura Ingraham. The network's Trump boosterism was hard to miss, yet so too was giving up lucrative commentator slots. It took ""Patriot Purge"" to finally stir their consciences to the point of departure. The network's leading news anchors, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, also objected to the documentary, running their complaints all the way up to Lachlan Murdoch, the chair and CEO of Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News. To no avail: the documentary ran, and Fox continues to show its support not only for Carlson's programming but for the conspiratorial, violent, racist content its viewers — and many Republican Party voters — seem to desire.   And that is a key takeaway for the network's embrace of Carlson: though he plays a powerful role in stitching together events like the insurrection and the Rittenhouse trial into a coherent narrative of conservative grievance and virtue, the underlying appeal plays on the preferences of the network's and the party's conservative base. The right had made Rittenhouse a hero while the bodies of the people he shot were still warm. Carlson is there to tell them not only was Rittenhouse right, but they were right, too. ",2
391,"London (CNN)People in the United Kingdom think that climate change, pollution and the environment are together the most important issues they face, well ahead of the pandemic, the impacts of Brexit and the country's troubled National Health Service, according to a poll from Ipsos MORI published on Wednesday.The poll showed the highest level of concern about the climate crisis since the agency began polling in 1988. Ipsos MORI publishes its poll monthly, and November's was carried out over a week during the COP26 climate conference. The event was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and received extensive national media coverage. Around 40% of people surveyed said climate change, pollution and the environment were among their top three concerns. The pandemic came second at 27% and Brexit was third, with 22%. Ipsos MORI interviewed more than 1,000 adults, who answered spontaneously and were not prompted with options as answers. Climate concern was 16 percentage points higher in November than October, when people expressed greater concern about Brexit, the pandemic and the economy. While there was a clear bump in interest during the COP26 conference, there has been longterm growth in concern about climate over the past decade, which has been confirmed by other polls, including from YouGov. The Ipsos MORI poll showed was a fairly even distribution of climate concern across age groups, genders and political affiliation.""[It's] very encouraging that climate change is no longer a preoccupation reserved to the young and the liberal,"" Gabriela Jiga-Boy, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Swansea, told CNN. ""It means that British society may not be very divided regarding climate change. This is very important in these times, when we discuss a lot about real or false polarization on issues, and we often exaggerate how polarized people actually are.""Climate a top concern for older people, tooMen and women considered the climate crisis a top issue almost equally, at 40% and 41%, respectively, the poll showed. And supporters of the center-right Conservative Party and center-left Labour Party were equal in their concern for climate issues.In the age group of 55 and over, 47% of people said it was a top issue. For the 35 to 54 age group, it was 43%. Among those 18 to 34 years old, just 27% said the same, though that age group was less likely to say they were worried about any particular issue.Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said that climate change is now a top priority among a majority of groups because the topic is ""becoming personal."" That's also true for how policies like net-zero emissions targets may affect them.Dozens of countries have set a net-zero emissions goal for mid-century, for which they plan to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions and ""capture"" excess, through actions like planing trees or using technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels. Such technology isn't fully developed and remains controversial.  ""We are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change -- from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy,"" Hiteva told CNN in an email.While concern about the climate crisis is fairly even among age groups, support for different types of climate action is more divisive.""Older people are more inclined to pay for investment in infrastructure to improve the experience of future generations, while people between the age of 18-25 are significantly less inclined to pay more for improvements that they will not experience in their lifetime,"" she said, citing her own research on climate action.""The only way for this to translate into action is to use the momentum of the moment and engage people with re-imagining how infrastructure investment can be designed and used in an innovative way which is not only kinder to the environment but is also more inclusive and fairer.""",2
392," (CNN)A wave of ""smash-and-grab"" crimes is plaguing upscale stores in major US cities, with mobs of thieves making off with expensive goods in brazen, nighttime raids. At least 18 people broke into a Nordstrom department store in Los Angeles Monday night and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise, the city's police chief said.The thefts followed a rash of similar incidents over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. A group of thieves swarmed the Southland Mall in Hayward on Sunday evening, wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry store before grabbing items and fleeing.Three suspects were arrested Saturday night after a mob ransacked a Nordstrom department store in Walnut Creek, east of San Francisco. Some 80 suspects were involved, and they fled the outdoor mall in at least 10 different vehicles, police said. That robbery came after similar raids Friday night near San Francisco's Union Square, where thieves targeted Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Bloomingdale's stores, a Walgreens and cannibis dispensaries. And California isn't the only place grappling with ""smash-and-grab"" crimes. Fourteen robbers barged into a Louis Vuitton store in suburban Chicago last week and fled with more than $100,000 in handbags and other merchandise. So why so many recent incidents? Are they linked to the holiday season? Is it pandemic restlessness?  ""This has nothing to do with the pandemic,"" said Pete Eliadis, a former law enforcement official and founder of security company Intelligence Consulting Partners. ""The pandemic is overused at this point.""But security experts cited a mix of several other factors.Such cases aren't always a priority for law enforcement San Francisco has seen a surge in crime since it reopened in the pandemic. In the Central district, for example, larceny and theft incidents are up almost 88% from a year earlier, and overall crime is up almost 52%, according to police statistics.Many of the store thieves wear masks or hoods, making them difficult to identify even when they're spotted on security cameras.Police in Los Angeles and San Francisco have made some arrests, but thieves often face few consequences, Eliadis said. One reason for this is law enforcement's lack of resources, which means theft cases sometimes are put on the back burner, he said. And, he added, the ""defund the police"" movement has sapped some officers' morale.""There's no political will to prosecute the people in this climate. Why should a police officer waste time getting into an altercation when the person is not going to jail because it's overcrowded and a prosecutor is not going to prosecute that case because it's not high on the priority list?"" Eliadis said. ""The takeaway is we need the political will, more prosecution and backing of law enforcement.""Thieves may face few consequences The decriminalization of low-level offenses in some states has created opportunities for criminals to manipulate the system, said Lynda Buel, president of Ohio-based security consulting firm SRMC. For example, Proposition 47, a California ballot initiative passed in 2014, sought to alleviate prison overcrowding by reducing the penalties for some crimes. The measure raised the threshold for felony theft from $500 to $950.""For the low-level criminal, the benefit far outweighs the risk, since the threshold for a misdemeanor offense is $950 -- meaning that a person can steal up to that amount and only be charged with a misdemeanor,"" Buel said.Organized crime rings are often behind these types of ""smash-and-grab"" operations and pay low-level criminals to steal for them, she said.  Security experts said dismantling these sophisticated crime groups must be a law enforcement priority.""People see the ability to commit these 'smash-and-grab incidents' knowing that there is little consequence, especially if the thefts are kept below the threshold of a felony offense,"" Buel said. ""It's easy, it's fast, and the payback is good.""   The holidays provide more opportunities for theftIt's not unusual for ""smash and grabs"" to increase around the Christmas holiday season, Buel said. Stores stock up before the holidays, which means there's a bounty of merchandise to pick from. That means more opportunities and more convenience for the smash-and-grabbers, she said. But retail theft by organized gangs is not limited to the holiday season. In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law reinstating a task force to investigate organized theft at stores. ""This is not new in the state ... We've been organized in a very deliberative manner to address the issue of organized retail crime for a number of years,"" Newsom said. ""We are doubling down on those efforts today.""In Illinois, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in September that crime rings are costing retailers across the country an estimated $45 billion in annual losses. He created a task force to crack down on organized crime rings that target stores.""These brazen, violent crimes are committed by sophisticated criminal organizations that are involved in drug trafficking, human trafficking and other serious crimes,"" Raoul said.There are numerous places to sell stolen itemsOnce items are stolen, there are several ways to sell them -- all extremely easy and with little regulation and monitoring from law enforcement, experts said. Most items grabbed in such cases have no serial numbers, making tracing them almost impossible, Eliadis said. ""It is incredibly easy to sell stolen merchandise online through e-commerce platforms,"" Buel said. ""E-commerce has really taken off as the place to sell stolen goods.""Other thieves don't need to sell their stolen goods on Craigslist or eBay. They can also use flea markets, pawn shops and street vendors.  Thieves can sell expensive items at slashed prices, meaning there's no shortage of buyers, Eliadis added.The result is a ruthless cycle that affects everyone, Eliadis said. Some affected stores will shut down or relocate. And retailers plagued by thefts see their insurance rates and private security costs increase -- costs that eventually get passed on the customer. ",2
393," (CNN)Arrest warrants were issued Monday for five Georgia police officers indicted on murder charges for the 2019 killing of a 24-year-old man. Fernando Rodriguez died of asphyxiation after being placed in a prone position while he was handcuffed and held down, allegedly in violation of state law. The indictment accuses Henry County Police Department officers Robert Butera and Quinton Phillips and former Hampton Police Department officers Mason Lewis, Marcus Stroud and Gregory Bowlden in Rodriguez's death on September 20, 2019, following contact with police outside a concert at the Atlanta Motor Speedway. The officers turned themselves in Monday and each posted $100,000 bond on Tuesday.  The indictment, handed down by a Henry County grand jury Friday night, charges all five officers with one count of malice murder, two counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault and violation of oath of office. A spokeswoman for the Henry County District Attorney's Office said arrest warrants for the five officers were issued Monday morning. The five-page indictment says that Rodriguez died of asphyxiation. Body-camera footage shows him walking down a street fully naked, away from the officers when they tased him more than a dozen times.  The indictment accuses the officers of contributing to Rodriguez's death by stretching him out ""on the ground in a prone position, while he was handcuffed and shackled, holding him down and applying pressure to his body, contrary"" to state laws.  ""Rodriguez, who lived in the Atlanta area, was leaving the Imagine Music Festival at the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton when officers encountered him,"" the district attorney's office said in a press release. ""In addition to holding his naked body down on the ground, the officers struck Rodriguez more than a dozen times with their Tasers.""In an interview with CNN on Monday, the Rodriguez family attorney called video of the incident ""revolting.""""This is a clear civil rights violation, and apparently the DA agrees,"" family attorney Page Pate said. The city of Hampton has already settled a multimillion-dollar civil lawsuit, according to Pate. The city did not respond to requests for comment.""They paid the family $3 million as soon as they saw the complaint,"" Pate said, adding that he anticipates Henry County to settle a similar suit. Scott Key, the attorney for former officer Mason Lewis, told CNN in an interview on Tuesday, ""we think malice murder is an overreach. He was doing his job."" ""He's devastated,"" Key said about his client's reaction to the indictment. ""But at the same time, he's looking forward to his day in court. We look forward to conducting our own investigation in the case and seeing the process until the end."" Key told CNN that since the incident, Lewis is no longer employed in law enforcement. CNN has not been able to reach attorneys for other officers.""The family is very pleased [with the indictment]"" Page told CNN. ""They've been waiting patiently for justice. We know this is long process, but this is a good start."" The Georgia Bureau of Investigation conducted the probe into Rodriguez's death, according to the DA office's press release. ",2
394," (CNN)It's the absolute worst-kept secret in politics: Donald Trump is full-speed-ahead on a 2024 presidential bid.The latest evidence came Tuesday when Politico reported on polling conducted in five swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- pitting the former President against current President Joe Biden.The polling was paid for by the Trump super PAC ""Make America Great Again, Again!"" which is the real name for the organization. CNN does not typically report partisan polls as they are paid for by, well, partisan candidates.The data, according to Politico, showed Trump ahead of Biden in each of the states by margins ranging from 3 points (Georgia) to 12 points (Michigan).The numbers, while clearly encouraging for Trump, are less important than the fact the polling is being conducted at all.What surveys in those five swing states are clearly meant to make clear -- to anyone and everyone considering a run for the 2024 GOP nomination: Trump is the prohibitive favorite in any such race.""Poll after poll clearly demonstrates that former President Donald Trump is still the 800-pound gorilla in the GOP and would be its 2024 nominee should he run,"" Tony Fabrizio, who conducted the polls, told Politico. ""This new data clearly shows that today the voters in these five key states would be happy to return Trump to the White House and send Biden packing.""Much of what Trump and his allies are doing at the moment, with the 2024 election nearly three years away, is trying to keep the field clear for the former President. They know that ambitious politicians -- Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri to name two -- are circling the 2024 contest. And the Trumpists want this message sent to those pols as loudly and clearly as possible: This is Trump's race to run, not yours.The Point: Polling done almost three years before an election -- and with a midterm election sandwiched in between -- should be taken with considerable caveats. But that Trump's super PAC is doing the polling tells you everything you need to know about the former President's plans and interests.",2
395," (CNN)Senate candidate Sean Parnell's abrupt end to his campaign in Pennsylvania has shaken up the Republican primary field in a crucial race as the party seeks to win a majority next fall.According to multiple Republican operatives in and outside of the Keystone State, the slate of GOP candidates could expand in coming weeks to include hedge fund executive David McCormick and daytime TV personality Dr. Mehmet Oz. ""Right now you've got a wide-open, fluid field in Pennsylvania,"" said Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and a CNN contributor.Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection, and Democrats see the seat as one of their top pickup opportunities heading into the 2022 midterms. Without Parnell as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, Republicans are hoping to defend a seat held by a member of their party for all but two of the last 52 years.McCormick, a former official in the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, is a Pennsylvania native and West Point graduate. For years he has lived in Connecticut, where his hedge fund is located, but Republicans in Pennsylvania have been trying to recruit McCormick to come back to the state.""There has been an accelerated outreach from Republican leaders, both within Pennsylvania and nationally, as well as donors, for Dave to come into the race,"" said one person close to McCormick. ""The Parnell departure has clearly created an opening where he's seriously considering it.""Pennsylvania Republicans are more perplexed that Oz, an Ohio-born doctor who attended medical school in Philadelphia and lives in New Jersey, is considering a run. Oz's interest in this race was first reported in the Washington Free Beacon and Politico, but the host of the Dr. Oz Show said in a 2007 interview that he would ""consider"" running for office some day, calling himself a ""moderate Republican.""Representatives of Oz did not respond to CNN's inquiries about his plans, but Republicans acknowledge that his celebrity could be a significant factor in a wide-open race.""This crowd is so big and unknown,"" said one GOP operative.Parnell's departure and the possible entrance of new candidates in the primary, which already includes Carla Sands and Jeff Bartos, has given Republicans a second chance to set their field after weeks of concerning developments with Parnell's candidacy after former President Donald Trump backed him.An Army combat veteran and former House candidate, Parnell had faced increased scrutiny of his personal life amid ongoing divorce and custody fights. Allegations against Parnell from his estranged wife, Laurie Snell, had raised concerns among some Republicans about his viability as a candidate. Snell had accused Parnell of being physically abusive toward her and injuring their children on two occasions, claims that Parnell has denied.But on Monday, a Pennsylvania judge awarded Snell full legal custody and primary physical custody of their three children. The judge also determined that Parnell committed some abusive acts toward his wife in the past.""There is nothing more important to me than my children, and while I plan to ask the court to reconsider, I can't continue with a Senate campaign,"" Parnell said in a statement.Parnell spoke with Trump on Monday to inform him of his plans, according to Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich. It's unclear whether the former President will back another person in the primary, though he has connections to multiple current and potential candidates.Sands, a Pennsylvania-born Republican fundraiser, served under Trump as ambassador to Denmark, while McCormick's wife is Dina Powell, who served as a national security official in Trump's White House and remains close to Trump's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.And in 2018, Trump appointed Oz to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. (Another Trump appointee to the council, Herschel Walker, is running for the Republican Senate nomination in Georgia and has Trump's endorsement.)""I could see Trump sitting it out if both get in,"" said one Republican operative close to the former President, referring to McCormick and Oz. ""Or Oz doesn't run, and Trump just goes all-in for Dave.""Democrats in Pennsylvania also have a competitive primary, with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Rep. Conor Lamb among those vying for the nomination. Republicans in the state say the primary could pull the eventual Democratic nominee too far to the left in the swing state where winning suburban swing voters is the key to victory.With the expected nationwide edge for Republicans in next year's midterm elections across the country, Dent says the best thing Trump could do in the Keystone State is stay away from the GOP primary.""Republicans have clear advantages going into the 2022 midterm, they just have to not blow it. And not blowing it requires former President Trump to behave constructively,"" Dent said. ""That would actually be constructive, to stay out of the primary.""",2
396," (CNN)Even after the rise and resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, the elections of a Black president and Vice President and several years of racial reckoning over state violence against Black men and women, if you want it's still plain to see how far some parts of the US haven't come on race. Just look at the trial of Travis McMichael, William ""Roddie"" Bryan and Travis's father Gregory McMichael for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. The details of the case are themselves stunning. According to his family, Arbery -- a runner -- was out for a jog. Two White men, claiming concern about local break-ins, grabbed their guns, jumped in a truck, pursued Arbery, later joined by a third White man. One of those men shot and killed Arbery with a shotgun. The McMichaels say they were defending themselves while attempting to make a ""citizen's arrest"" -- yet Travis McMichael testified during the trial Arbery never threatened any of the men now on trial for his killing. That a group of White men felt justified in chasing a Black man through their neighborhood -- even a man they believe had committed burglary (not a capital offense) -- and then felt they deserve to get off scot-free after one of them shoots him dead is egregious enough. But compounding this egregiousness is the racist attack launched on the victim by a member of the defense team. On Monday, defense attorney Laura Hogue went as far as to say during her closing argument in the case, ""Turning Ahmaud Arbery into a victim after the choices he made does not reflect the reality of what brought Ahmaud Arbery to Satilla Shores in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails."" What does the state of Arbery's pedicure have to do with whether the man who shot him is guilty of murder? Nothing. There is no conceivable justification for Hogue, in her role as her client's advocate, to cite such details, other than a blatant attempt to paint a racially coded picture in jurors' minds of Arbery as less than human, as a dirty beast who posed a legitimate threat. A person the members of the jury -- nearly all of whom are also White -- might not want in their own neighborhoods, either. It was, it seems, a naked ploy to weaponize White fear in order to secure an acquittal for her client. Arbery's mother left the courtroom in shock and disgust. She told CNN's Anderson Cooper she was appalled the defense attempted to ""dehumanize"" her son. It was a shameful display, and the kind of character assassination tactic of someone who doesn't believe they can win on the merits. ""Literally after those men in that courtroom assassinated their child, now they're sitting here assassinating his character,"" said family attorney Benjamin Crump. It was also a familiar ploy in the sad, long history of racist violence in the United States. Over and over again, Black victims are trashed and their names tarnished after their deaths in an effort to justify the violence against them. These portrayals go back to the days of slavery, and particularly to the Reconstruction era, when many Whites felt threatened by newfound Black freedom. Lynchings and killings, including the murder of Emmett Till, a child, were justified by the claim that Black men and boys had raped or otherwise assaulted White women. The image of Black men as brutes and savages is acutely captured in the pro-Ku-Klux-Klan film ""Birth of a Nation."" Decades and over a century later in some cases, these portrayals have shifted, but they haven't gone away. When White people commit acts of violence against Black people, Black men, women, and even children are routinely slandered as scary, threatening, and animalistic, the message being the white assailant or murderer was acting in self-defense -- and the Black victim had it coming. This same trope remains employed so often that ""he was no angel"" — the line trotted out, often by conservative and even some mainstream news outlets, after the killings of Black men and boys — is widely understood as a clichéd trope. Even 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot by a cop when he was on the playground, was called a ""thug"" by a police union president and blamed for his own death. And now here is Arbery, with the state of his toenails used to try to justify his killing. The question now is whether the jury will fall for it -- or whether, after so much has changed and so much has stayed the same, they'll see these disgusting tactics for what they are. I hope that as they deliberate, whatever outcome they reach, they will reject this attempted victim-blaming, and pursue justice for Ahmaud Arbery. But the long history that set the scene for Arbery's murder, and that is playing into the defense strategy of the men who pursued him and the one who pulled the trigger, won't go away when the jury renders its verdict. That's up to all of us: To name these racist tropes, to understand their insidiousness, and to reject them. ",2
397," (CNN Business)A jury in Ohio ruled Tuesday that three major pharmaceutical chains bore responsibility for the opioid epidemic in two Ohio counties.The civil case, brought in federal court against CVS (CVS), Walmart (WMT) and Walgreens, marks the first time pharmacies have been found responsible in the nationwide epidemic.""It is a precedent setting case,"" Mark Lanier, the lead trial attorney for Lake and Trumbull Counties, told CNN Tuesday.Damages are set to be adjudicated in the spring. Lanier said that each county would be seeking over $1 billion in damages. Together, the counties represent some 440,000 Ohioans, according to court documents.The suit, which was initially filed in 2018, was part of the federal multi-district litigation created that year to address the manifold claims against opioid manufacturers and distributors.The counties alleged that the pharmacies ""abused their position of special trust and responsibility"" as registered dispensers of controlled drugs, and in so doing ""fostered a black market for prescription opioids.""""Prescription opioid pill mills and rogue prescribers cannot channel opioids for illicit use without at least the tacit support and willful blindness of the Defendants, if not their knowing support,"" the complaint read.In statements to CNN on Tuesday, all three pharmaceutical chains indicated that they would appeal the verdict.""We are disappointed with the outcome of this trial. The facts and the law do not support the verdict. We believe the trial court committed significant legal errors in allowing the case to go before a jury on a flawed legal theory that is inconsistent with Ohio law,"" Fraser Engerman, a Walgreens spokesperson, told CNN.""As we have said throughout this process, we never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the 'pill mills' and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis,"" Engerman added.In a statement, Walmart criticized the trial as ""riddled with remarkable legal and factual mistakes.""""Plaintiffs' attorneys sued Walmart in search of deep pockets while ignoring the real causes of the opioid crisis—such as pill mill doctors, illegal drugs, and regulators asleep at the switch—and they wrongly claimed pharmacists must second-guess doctors in a way the law never intended and many federal and state health regulators say interferes with the doctor-patient relationship,"" Walmart's statement read, in part. ""As a pharmacy industry leader in the fight against the opioid crisis, Walmart is proud of our pharmacists, who are dedicated to helping patients in the face of a tangled web of conflicting federal and state opioid guidelines.""CVS similarly defended its pharmacists in a statement.""We strongly disagree with the decision,"" CVS spokesperson Mike DeAngelis said. ""Pharmacists fill legal prescriptions written by DEA-licensed doctors who prescribe legal, FDA-approved substances to treat actual patients in need."" ""We're proud of the substantial work we've done to support our pharmacists in detecting illegitimate prescribing,"" he continued. ""But the simple facts are that opioid prescriptions are written by doctors, not pharmacists; opioid medications are made and marketed by manufacturers, not pharmacists; and our health care system depends on pharmacists to fill legitimate prescriptions that doctors deem necessary for their patients.""Counties reactThe verdict was happy news to officials in Lake and Trumbull counties, where damages are expected to fund opioid abatement measures.""Today's verdict means a lot to Lake County, because it is a substantive step forward to real healing in this epidemic,"" Lake County Commissioner John Plecnik told CNN.  ""On behalf of all Lake County families, we thank the jury for sending a powerful message to rebuke those responsible for overselling opioids."" ""This verdict will also mean greater resources to combat opioid addiction, which are desperately needed,"" Plecnik said. ""I can't say this strongly enough, no one is immune to the impact of addiction and opioid abuse, and this is not just a victory for Lake and Trumbull, it is a victory for all Americans.""""Truly, in Lake County, we have not had a corner of the county that has not been impacted by this epidemic,"" Kim Frasier, head of Lake County's department of Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services, said in a Tuesday afternoon press conference. ""This verdict gives voice to those individuals and those families who have been so traumatized.""April Caraway, head of Trumbull County's Mental Health and Recovery Board, echoed the sentiment.""We appreciate some vindication,"" she said. ""This was difficult, but we wanted to do it for the people who've lost people.""Next stepsLanier told CNN that attorneys for both sides are still scheduling the damages phase, where Judge Dan Polster will put a dollar figure to the damages suffered by Lake and Trumbull counties. In the meantime, an appeal is expected in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.",2
398,"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN)The prosecutor in the trial of three men accused of killing Ahmaud Arbery sought Tuesday to simplify the events that led to the 25-year-old's death, taking the podium the day after defense teams spent closing arguments trying to criminalize Arbery, alleging he brought his death on himself. Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski delivered her rebuttal early Tuesday, emphasizing to the jury Arbery was accused of no crime and the defendants told police they knew of no crime he'd committed. She had almost two hours remaining after delivering the first part of her closing arguments ahead of defense counsel. Live updates: Follow the trialLawyers for the three White men charged with murder used their final statements Monday to say Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and William ""Roddie"" Bryan Jr. had reason to believe Arbery was up to no good because he'd entered an under-construction home and he ran when confronted. Laura Hogue, one of Gregory McMichael's attorneys, referred to Arbery as a ""recurring nighttime intruder"" and implied he had nefarious intent when he arrived ""in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails."" Dunikoski seized on the defense notion that the McMichaels were scared -- and their Glynn County, Georgia' s Satilla Shores neighborhood had been living in fear -- because of crime in the area. That the armed men decided to chase Arbery for five minutes in their trucks is evidence alone they weren't frightened, she said. They had alternatives -- including never chasing Arbery or calling police -- but instead they chose to pursue Arbery even after he repeatedly eluded them, said Dunikoski. They committed aggravated assault with their trucks -- and the McMichaels, with their guns -- while trying to falsely imprison Arbery, she said. During the course of these felonies, Dunikoski said, they killed Arbery. ""If you take that out would he be alive?"" she asked the jury. ""It's real simple. The answer is you can't take out any of these crimes. If you take out any one of these crimes that they committed and he's still alive. All of the underlying felonies played a substantial and necessary part in causing the death of Ahmaud Arbery.""Claims that they were protecting their neighborhood appear spurious, Dunikoski said, when you consider  the property owner never accused Arbery of any crime -- aside from entering the property without incident -- and nothing had been stolen there in the months prior to Arbery's fatal shooting. Dunikoski has also said the defendants can't claim self-defense when Arbery, unarmed and on foot, tried for five minutes to elude three men, two of them armed, chasing him in a pair of pickup trucks. She asked the jury: Why, if this was about stopping crime, did the McMichaels never mention a specific crime or citizen's arrest to the police at the scene?Following Dunikoski's rebuttal, Judge Timothy Walmsley gave jurors instructions and said, for Bryan, he'd permit them to consider simple assault, reckless conduct or reckless driving in lieu of aggravated assault with a truck. The jury, composed of nine White women, two White men and a Black man (with two White women and a White man as alternates), began deliberating shortly thereafter. The jury spent more than six hours deliberating on day one. Walmsley checked in on jurors twice to see if a verdict was imminent, with the foreperson reporting they had not returned one. The jury told the judge they considered continuing deliberations into the evening, but ultimately decided to break. Court adjourned around 6:30 p.m. ET and day two of deliberations will begin Wednesday at 8 a.m.Judge denies motion for mistrialDefense lawyers made remarks Monday that legal experts felt were racially insensitive, and Dunikoski has insisted the defendants targeted Arbery ""because he was a Black man running down the street.""Travis McMichael testified he never saw Arbery armed, never heard Arbery threaten him and Arbery showed no interest in conversing with McMichael.The men acted on ""assumptions and driveway decisions,"" Dunikoski has said, and they had no immediate knowledge Arbery committed a crime, a key factor in claiming citizen's arrest. The defense moved for a mistrial, saying Dunkioski's misstated the state's now-defunct citizen's arrest law. Walmsley denied the motion.Along with his father, Gregory McMichael, and Bryan, his neighbor, Travis McMichael faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony in the February 23, 2020, killing. The trio say they pursued Arbery only after suspecting him of burglary.Travis McMichael testified he shot Arbery in self-defense after Arbery grabbed his gun. He told Dunikoski he was ""scattered"" and traumatized when he initially told police he didn't know if Arbery grabbed the shotgun. The men have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they face maximum sentences of life in prison without parole. Family objects to comments from defense attorneyOn Monday, Hogue claimed Arbery repeatedly trespassed -- and perhaps more -- when entering a construction site in the neighborhood outside Brunswick. ""Turning Ahmaud Arbery into a victim after the choices that he made does not reflect the reality of what brought Ahmaud Arbery to Satilla Shores in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails,"" Hogue said.Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, almost tripped leaving the courtroom, saying, ""I gotta get out of here.""Arbery was never charged with any crimes in the neighborhood. The owner of the property never said Arbery committed a crime, just that he was caught on camera at the site. Race has been a key focus. Arbery is Black, and 11 of the 12 jurors are White. Ben Crump, an attorney for Arbery's father, suggested race played a factor in the killing.""They had dozens of other people who visited the home. Nobody chased them. Nobody said that they burglarized the home. Why is that?"" Crump asked Monday.It was a point important to Dunikoski's rebuttal. Arbery had been to the under-construction property multiple times, she said, but he never stole anything. Responding to defense implications Arbery could've been responsible for items stolen from a boat in 2019, Dunikoski noted property owner Larry English told police he had no idea who stole the items, the items may have been stolen at another location and he suspected subcontractors might be responsible. Video from December 2020, showing Arbery inside the home looking around and nothing more, also appears to provide counterpoint to the argument Arbery was never known to jog in Satilla Shores. In the video, Arbery exits the home empty-handed toward the street and breaks into a jog, disappearing from view as he runs down Satilla Drive. ""What's Mr. Arbery doing? More importantly, what's Mr. Arbery not doing?"" she asked the jury in reference to the video. If Arbery committed a crime, Dunikoski said, it was criminal trespass, or maybe prowling or loitering, all misdemeanors -- none meeting the prerequisite for citizen's arrest. The McMichaels told police they didn't know if Arbery had been in English's house, she reminded jurors. ""If the (McMichaels and Bryan) were not conducting a lawful citizen's arrest, you do not have to consider ... self-defense because if it's not a lawful citizen's arrest -- that they were the first unjustified aggressors and they were committing felonies against Mr. Arbery, and therefore they don't get to claim self-defense.""During jury instructions, Walmsley told jurors in a citizen's arrest, the person making the arrest must have witnessed the crime with her or his own senses or the perpetrator must've admitted a crime. It is not legal to make a citizen's arrest based on ""unsupported statements of others alone,"" and the person making the arrest -- either after the crime, or in the case of a felony, during an escape -- must exact the arrest immediately, the judge said. Lawyers: Defendants just protecting neighborhood""Travis McMichael spent almost a decade of his life learning about duty and responsibility,"" his attorney Jason Sheffield said Monday, referring to McMichael's time in the US Coast Guard. ""He received extensive training on how to make a decision that will ultimately impact his beliefs."" Dunikoski countered Travis McMichael didn't follow his training and couldn't have been adhering to de-escalation techniques when he chased Arbery -- his armed father cursing at Arbery from his truck bed -- and then exited his truck with a shotgun. In closing, Sheffield reiterated the feelings of neighbors who testified they were afraid because of incidents in the neighborhood, including burglaries. Travis McMichael felt a ""responsibility"" to help protect the neighborhood, Sheffield said. ""These are real experiences with real people who were very scared, and so they took it upon themselves to do something about it -- got cameras, called the police, notify each other, citizens' watch, neighborhood watch,"" he said.   Hogue told the jury they needed only to consider two questions.""Did Greg McMichael have reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion to believe that Ahmaud Arbery had committed a burglary ... and did he have reasonable and probable grounds to believe that Ahmaud Arbery was escaping or attempting to escape yet again?"" she said.Attorney Kevin Gough, who represents Bryan, described his client as a witness, arguing jurors should consider Bryan was the one who filmed the chase and killing, changing the course of the investigation. ""He did not know and could not know that Arbery would be shot. By that time, sadly, there was nothing that Roddie Bryan could do to prevent this tragedy. He didn't shoot anyone. At the time of the shooting, he was some distance back. He was armed only with his cell phone,"" Gough said.""Ladies and gentlemen, without Roddie Bryan, there is no case,"" he said.In her closing, Dunikoski emphasized everyone is responsible. Because all three men committed felonies before Travis McMichael shot Arbery, they are parties to the crime, she said. ""Under the law in Georgia, it's as if they were all holding the gun together,"" she said. ",2

400," (CNN Business)Apple on Tuesday sued NSO Group and its parent company, accusing the Israeli firm of violating a federal anti-hacking law by selling potent software that clients have used to spy on Apple customers. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, alleges that NSO's spyware, known as Pegasus, and other malware have caused Apple monetary and property damages, and violated the human rights of Apple users along the way. ""To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,"" Apple said in a statement. In a statement Tuesday, NSO Group did not address the specifics of the lawsuit and instead said the firm's technology saves lives.NSO Group provides ""lawful tools"" to help governments fight pedophiles and terrorists, the firm said.While NSO Group has long maintained that it only sells its software to authorized users for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes, researchers have for years uncovered evidence that Pegasus has been used to surveil dissidents and human rights activists. Researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September said that an unidentified party was using Pegasus, and a vulnerability in Apple operating software, to spy on a Saudi activist. The lawsuit is the latest setback for NSO Group, which cybersecurity analysts and human rights activists have long accused of doing business with repressive governments. The firm's easy-to-use spyware is capable of eavesdropping on a phone's communications and accessing other sensitive data on the device, according to researchers. The US Commerce Department this month added NSO Group to its so-called ""entity list,"" effectively banning the company from buying software components from US vendors without a license. Commerce accused NSO Group, and another Israeli firm known as Candiru, of providing spyware to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target"" journalists, embassy workers and activists.In a statement at the time, NSO Group said it was ""dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed.""""We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world's most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based [on] the American values we deeply share,"" according to the statement, ""which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts [sic] with government agencies that misused our products.""Candiru could not be reached for comment at the time.Apple is at least the second major US tech firm to sue NSO Group. Facebook (now known as Meta) in 2019 sued NSO Group for allegedly facilitating the breach of 1,400 phones running the WhatsApp messaging application. NSO Group has denied the allegations made by Facebook, and tried to block the case from moving forward. But a US appeals court this month ruled that the lawsuit could proceed.Apple said it would contribute $10 million, plus any damages from the lawsuit, to ""organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.""The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages from NSO Group, as well as ""compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.""NSO Group is just one of several firms that sell specialized hacking tools to break into different types of mobile phones.  In its lawsuit, Apple's lawyers reflected on what it called a ""continual arms race"" between Apple engineers and NSO Group's code-writers.""Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades,"" the complaint states.",2
401," (CNN)Mammoths are long to be known as ancient land dwellers, so scientists were shocked to find remains from the animal at the bottom of the ocean. Pilot Randy Prickett and scientist Steven Haddock, researchers with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), discovered a Columbian mammoth tusk 185 miles offshore and 10,000 feet deep in the ocean in 2019, the institution said in a news release.At the time they were only able to collect a small piece of the tusk, so they returned in July 2021 to get the complete sample. ""You start to 'expect the unexpected' when exploring the deep sea, but I'm still stunned that we came upon the ancient tusk of a mammoth,"" said Haddock. ""Our work examining this exciting discovery is just beginning and we look forward to sharing more information in the future.""University of Michigan paleontologist Daniel Fisher, who specializes in the study of mammoths and mastodons, said it is unlike anything he has ever seen. ""Other mammoths have been retrieved from the ocean, but generally not from depths of more than a few tens of meters,"" Fisher said. A variety of research facilities are examining the tusk to determine a variety of information about it including the age of the animal at its death, the release said. The researchers said the cold, high pressure environment helped to preserve the tusk, so it can be studied in greater detail. The scientists believe it could be the oldest well-preserved mammoth tusk recovered from this region of North America, and the UCSC Geochronology Lab estimates it is more than 100,000 years old after analyzing the radioisotopes. Researchers hope the data collected can not only tell them more about the mammoth they found, but the species in general. ""Specimens like this present a rare opportunity to paint a picture both of an animal that used to be alive and of the environment in which it lived,"" said Beth Shapiro, lead researcher at the UCSC Paleogenomics Lab.""Mammoth remains from continental North America are particularly rare, and so we expect that DNA from this tusk will go far to refine what we know about mammoths in this part of the world.""",2
402," (CNN)The man accused of careening his SUV into a Wisconsin parade, killing six people and injuring more than 60 others, was a registered sex offender in Nevada and had an active arrest warrant in that state, court records show.He was also released on bond this month after allegedly running over a woman who said she's the mother of his child earlier this month, according to court documents.Darrell E. Brooks, 39, of Milwaukee, is the lone suspect in Sunday's parade tragedy, Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said.   Brooks was charged Tuesday with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the parade incident, court documents show. Prosecutors said they will consider a sixth homicide charge after saying in court that a child had died.The judge set bail at $5 million, saying he believes Brooks is a flight risk. Some are wondering why Brooks was released on $1,000 bond after allegedly running over a woman on November 2 -- an amount the district attorney's office now calls ""inappropriately low."" What allegedly happened November 2Brooks is accused of running over the woman with his car while she was walking through a gas station parking lot, according to a criminal complaint.The woman told authorities she was the mother of his child, according to the criminal complaint. ""Officers observed tire tracks on her left pants leg,"" the criminal complaint read.Prosecutors filed five charges related to the incident including: obstructing an officer; second-degree recklessly endangering safety with domestic abuse assessments; disorderly conduct with domestic abuse assessments; and misdemeanor battery with domestic abuse assessments.Brooks was also charged with bail jumping because he was already out on bail following an incident from July 24, 2020, according to court documents.The Milwaukee County district attorney's office now says it should not have recommended such a low bail for Brooks and have launched an internal review into the decision.""The State's bail recommendation in this case was inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges and the pending charges against Mr. Brooks,"" the office said in a statement. ""The bail recommendation in this case is not consistent with the approach of the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office toward matters involving violent crime, nor was it consistent with the risk assessment of the defendant prior to setting of bail.""CNN reached out to Brooks' attorney from the 2020 and earlier November 2021 incident about the DA statement, but has not yet received a response.The suspect is also a registered sex offenderQuestions about why Brooks was released on $1,000 bond came as news emerged about his criminal record in Nevada.Brooks pleaded guilty to statutory sexual seduction in November 2006, according to court and inmate records. Additional details about the case were not immediately available. CNN has been unable to identify Brooks' lawyer for this case.According to the inmate records, Brooks served his sentence in the Northern Nevada Correctional Center from March 2007 to September 2008.The Nevada sex offender registry shows Brooks is a registered sex offender in that state. Brooks also has an outstanding arrest warrant in Nevada in an unrelated case for which he was arrested and jumped bail, authorities said. The warrant was issued on August 15, 2016, for jumping bail, said Sarah Johns, Washoe County Sheriff's Office spokesperson. Johns said detectives later determined Brooks was in Wisconsin. ""However, detectives did not have viable intelligence on Brooks' exact location.""CNN has reached out to a previous attorney for Brooks, but has not received a response.Bail was reduced from $10,000 to $500 after another incidentIn the 2020 incident, Brooks is accused of firing a handgun during an argument, according to a charging complaint. While arresting Brooks, authorities say they found a stolen handgun and three ""multicolored pills,"" which later tested ""presumptively positive"" for methamphetamines.Brooks was charged with two counts of second-degree reckless endangering safety while using a dangerous weapon and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon.Bail had initially been set at $10,000 in that case but because Brooks had asked for a speedy jury trial, which could not be met, bail was reduced to $500. Brooks was released on bail in that case on February 21, according to the district attorney's office.What led up to the Waukesha tragedyBrooks was involved in a domestic disturbance earlier Sunday and left the scene just prior to driving his SUV through the parade, the police chief said.Officers tried to top Brooks as he approached the parade in his SUV, but Brooks allegedly drove through barricades. ""When the suspect was driving through and into the crowd, one officer did discharge his firearm and fire shots at the suspect to stop the threat but due to the amount of people, had to stop, stop and fire -- not fire any other additional shots,"" Thompson said.Brooks was not injured.The five victims killed range in age from 52 to 81. At least 18 children were hospitalized.Brooks went in a stranger's home for helpAfter the parade tragedy, Brooks was seen on a Ring doorbell video asking a Waukesha resident for help.Daniel Rider, 24, told CNN he was in his recliner watching football on Sunday, unaware of what happened at the parade. He said a man -- later identified as Brooks -- rang his doorbell and asked to use his phone to call an Uber, saying he was homeless. Rider's family had recently told him about a sermon calling on everyone to help the homeless. So he invited Brooks in, made him a sandwich and let him use his phone.Rider said Brooks smelled of marijuana, but he didn't feel threatened by the man in his home. When he saw police going up and down his street, he had a feeling it was related to Brooks. So he asked Brooks to leave, and he did.Brooks then returned, claiming his ID was left in the house, but Rider wouldn't open the door. Police told Brooks to put up his hands and arrested him in front of Rider's home.""Uber showed up maybe a minute after he was in custody,"" Rider said. ""So I just think about sometimes if he'd gotten in that car, what could have happened?""",2
403," (CNN)Employees of the Massachusetts hospital system Mass General Brigham have asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a lawsuit they've brought challenging their employer's Covid-19 vaccine mandate.The employees have struck out in their attempts to get a district court or the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals to block the health care provider's mandate, which required employees to be vaccinated by November 5. The hospital system has declined to grant the employees who brought the lawsuit exemptions to the mandate despite, according to the filing, their sincerely held religious beliefs or medical concerns about getting vaccinated.Non-compliant employees have been terminated, the application filed with Justice Stephen Breyer on Tuesday said.In the filing, the employees pointed to other employees who were granted exemptions by Mass General Brigham. They said that the hospital hadn't proven in the litigation that extending those exemptions to the wider group of unvaccinated employees would cause an undue burden on the health care provider.""The fact that Respondent is already accommodating hundreds of other employees conclusively refutes Respondent's mere assertions that it would cause an undue hardship to accommodate 'further exemptions' or 'additional unvaccinated employees"" because it needs to 'minimize the number of unvaccinated staff' and not 'allow large numbers of employees to remain unvaccinated,'"" the application with the Supreme Court said, while quoting from filings the hospital had submitted in lower court proceedings in the case.The challengers to the hospital's mandate argue that it's a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits religious discrimination in employment. Mass General Brigham is the state's largest private employer and its vaccine requirements cover some 80,000 employees, according to the health care network.Opponents of vaccine mandates have had only some success in blocking them in court and private entities typically have more legal wiggle room than governments in how they shape their mandates. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett previously refused to disturb Indiana University's vaccine mandate, and a majority of the court also declined an emergency request to block a mandate implemented by Maine's government for health care workers, though there were conservative dissenters who took issue with the Maine regime's lack of exemption for religious beliefs. The Supreme Court is now considering whether to intervene in a challenge to a New York state health care worker mandate that is very similar to the Maine case.The application concerning Mass General Brigham's mandate was filed with Breyer because he oversees the circuit from where the case arises. He could act unilaterally on the request, ask for more briefings from the case's parties or refer the application to the full court for further consideration.",2
404," (CNN)Brian Laundrie died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head, an attorney for the Laundrie family told CNN Tuesday.""Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide,"" said attorney Steven Bertolino. CNN has reached out to authorities for further comment, and has followed up with Bertolino regarding how Laundrie came to be in possession of a gun.Laundrie's remains were found in a Florida nature reserve last month after a weekslong manhunt. He disappeared just days after his fiancée Gabby Petito was reported missing.The couple had been traveling across the country over the summer in a converted van and documenting their travels on social media. The case gained national attention as authorities searched for both.Laundrie returned to his parents' house in Florida on September 1 without Petito. As police were trying to question the family about Petito's whereabouts, Laundrie went missing on September 13 or 14 after leaving home with a backpack, according to his parents. Petito's remains were found in Wyoming on September 19. Her death was ruled a homicide by manual strangulation.Petito's family says they are ""aware of the circumstances"" regarding Laundrie. But they are not making an official comment at the request of the US Attorney's Office and the Teton County Prosecutor's Office in Wyoming, according to a statement from the family.The family was asked not to make any comments while the investigation into her death is ongoing, the statement said.A Florida medical examiner's office confirmed Tuesday Laundrie had died of suicide by a gunshot wound to the head.The office won't make the autopsy report public ""until the law enforcement investigation is complete,"" the office said in a release.A timeline of the Petito caseWhat led to Petito's death remains a mystery. The FBI had described Laundrie as a ""person of interest"" in her murder, but he was not charged. He had, though, been indicted for allegedly using two accounts that belonged to someone else in the days after she died. Laundrie's remains were found October 20 in an area of Carlton Reserve that had been underwater during previous searches of the 25,000-acre nature reserve in North Port. Laundrie's father, who was searching with authorities the day his son's remains were found, discovered a notebook near where Laundrie's body was found. Experts said at the time the notebook could be key in providing answers. The notebook was wet at the time, and officials haven't yet said whether they have gained any information from it. Bertolini said in October Laundrie's parents had discussed ""several times"" the possibility their son had died by suicide. ",2
405,"Berdyansk, Ukraine  (CNN)The Ukrainian naval patrol boat ""Kremenchuk"" churns out into the gun-grey waters of the Sea of Azov, one mounted machine gun pointing aft, another pointing fore into the drizzle.Commander Ivan Ovchar explains his ship's mission: ""To defend and maintain the sovereignty of Ukraine.""The threat, the officer and many of Ukraine's allies believe, comes from Russia.For weeks, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been expressing growing concern about Moscow's military activity on the Ukrainian border.""We don't know what President [Vladimir] Putin's intentions are, but we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said Saturday during a trip to Senegal, referring to Russian military incursions, acknowledged or not, into neighboring countries. ""We do know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and then using that as an excuse to do what Russia's planning to do all along.""The Kremlin has responded by accusing western countries of ""hysteria"" about Russia invading Ukraine.Strait jacketWith tensions high in the region, CNN joined the Ukrainian navy vessel departing from Berdyansk on Ukraine's Azov coastline. Usually, Commander Ovchar's crew comes across six or seven Russian coast guard patrol boats, he says, but on this mission, there were none.The sea he's patrolling borders Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow following a controversial referendum in 2014, in violation of international law.Since seizing Crimea, Russia has built a bridge linking it to its own territory. The Kerch Bridge over the Kerch Strait serves as the only direct connection between Russia and Crimea -- and gives Moscow de facto control of the sea's access to the Black Sea and Mediterranean beyond.But Ukraine has a plan to try to keep Moscow from taking complete control of the body of water that links Ukraine's two biggest ports, Berdyansk and Mariupol.Ukraine's new Defense Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced November 13 that the pace of building a new naval port in Berdyansk was to be increased. On Tuesday, CNN gained exclusive access to the ""Sehid"" or ""East"" base under construction.It was immediately clear that a lot of work still needed to be done for this base to be anywhere near completion.The aim was to complete the first phase of construction -- new living quarters, administrative buildings and a small medical facility on the site of a disused tin factory -- by the end of year. However, with less than six weeks to go, there was not even a roof on the main building.A special detachment of military builders toiled with masonry, slapping on cement and laying bricks, a Ukrainian flag billowing as they worked.The scale of the task at hand became even starker as we walked down onto the port, joined to a commercial port.""This will be the position of the docks,"" Capt. 2nd Class Alexander Serdiyk said, pointing to heaps of warped metal and boulders lying haphazardly in the sea. ""We plan to have this section completed in two years.""But Ukraine may not have two years to prepare for conflict.The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, Brigader General Kyrylo Budanov, told the US defense newspaper Military Times that Russia was increasing troop levels and weapons systems in Crimea for an offensive that could come at any time. The Kremlin has repeatedly said it has no plans to invade Ukraine. ""The American and Ukrainian media claim that Russia is preparing for an attack on Ukraine, and we are saying that Ukraine is planning hostilities against Donbas, against the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, said Tuesday. ""We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for an attempt to forcefully resolve the Donbas issue.""  Ukraine's allies have begun responding to what they see as a fresh threat from its neighbor to the east.On Monday, CNN reported that the Biden administration was weighing the possibility of sending military advisers and new equipment, including weaponry, to Ukraine. The package could include Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-armor missiles and mortars.The US is also considering sanctions with European allies if Russia invades Ukraine.Last week, British Defence Minister Ben Wallace visited Ukraine and signed an agreement to ""develop the capabilities of the naval forces of Ukraine."" CNN learned Tuesday that part of the deal will focus on Berdyansk.The same day, the Ukrainian navy announced the arrival of two ""Island-type"" boats named ""Fastiv"" and ""Sumy,"" delivered from Baltimore in the United States to Odessa in Ukraine.""Soon the boats will raise the Ukrainian navy flag and under the command of Ukrainian crews they will begin their combat journey to ensure maritime safety in the Black and Azov seas,"" Admiral Alexey Neizhpapa said.The bigger question is whether new Ukrainian ships and infrastructure, plus warnings from the West, will be enough of a deterrent.

406," (CNN)The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection issued five new subpoenas on Tuesday targeting right-wing extremist groups that were involved in the attack, including the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.The subpoenas went to the Proud Boys and its leader Enrique Tarrio, as well as the Oath Keepers and its leader Stewart Rhodes. Dozens of members of both groups have been charged in the attack on the US Capitol, and prosecutors have said they conspired ahead of time to disrupt the Electoral College proceedings. (Tarrio and Rhodes have not been charged.)The panel also subpoenaed Robert Patrick Lewis, chairman of 1st Amendment Praetorian, a group that the committee says provided security at ""multiple rallies leading up to January 6.""""We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the committee, said in a statement.Several dozen subpoenas have already been issued as part of the investigation, with mixed success. Investigators say they've spoken to more than 200 witnesses, but some key players from former President Donald Trump's world have stonewalled the probe and refused to testify or produce documents.Right-wing extremists played a major role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Leaders of the Proud Boys were involved in some of the early clashes that overpowered the police lines and breached the building. Members of the Oath Keepers were seen weaving through the crowd in military formation and entering the Rotunda. They're also accused of stashing weapons at a Virginia hotel before the riot.Dozens of members of these right-wing groups are now facing serious criminal charges tied to the January 6 riot, and judges have said many of them are too dangerous to release while they await trial.But so far, Democrats haven't been able to directly connect Trump to the violence that these groups perpetrated at the Capitol. There are plenty of connections between Trump associates and members of these groups, but there is scant evidence that Trump knew of any plan to violently disrupt Congress.The Justice Department has said Rhodes directed members of the Oath Keepers on January 6 while they stormed the Capitol and allegedly destroyed government property. He hasn't been charged with any crimes, even as prosecutors crack down on his followers. CNN reported in July that Rhodes gave a voluntary interview to the FBI and that investigators seized his cell phone. He has denied all wrongdoing.Tarrio is currently in jail after pleading guilty to burning a church's Black Lives Matter banner and bringing high-capacity rifle magazines into DC shortly before the January 6 insurrection. Those charges kept him out of DC on January 6. But he has remained defiant about the role that his organization played in the attack, saying the incident was worth celebrating, while nominally condemning violence.The committee has already issued subpoenas to dozens of people affiliated with the January 6 attack, including Trump White House advisers, Trump campaign officials, several key organizers of the political rally that preceded the riot, and pro-Trump provocateurs who were involved in ""Stop the Steal"" groups.The committee was established in July and has done most of its work in private. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat on the committee, told CNN on Saturday that the panel has already interviewed more than 200 witnesses, including many people who were ""part of the Trump administration."" But other Trump allies have followed Trump's directives to ignore the investigation altogether.Trump ally Steve Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress after defying the panel's subpoena for records and testimony. (He pleaded not guilty.) Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who played a key role in Trump's attempted coup, appeared for a deposition earlier this month but stonewalled the committee by refusing to answer questions, claiming the material was privileged.Proud Boys lawyer respondsA lawyer affiliated with Proud Boys International LLC said on Tuesday he plans to provide some already public documents about the group's formation and bylaws to the House. But he may not have Proud Boys records that speak to some of what the committee wants, such as documents about their activities late last year and around January 6. The lawyer and former Proud Boys chairman, Jason Van Dyke, said some of the documents he has about the group he also will try to protect under attorney-client privileges.Van Dyke received the committee's subpoena, he said, but hasn't had ties to the group since November 2018.""It's been a defunct entity since then. They're wasting their time,"" Van Dyke told CNN. ""They'll have to get it from Tarrio."" The committee acknowledged the Proud Boys International organization dissolved earlier this year.Attorneys for Tarrio and Rhodes have not responded to requests for comment.A spokesperson for the DC Department of Corrections, where Tarrio is still held, hasn't responded to several requests from CNN on whether the jail is allowing detainees to speak to the House select committee. Tarrio is set to be in jail into the new year.This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",2
