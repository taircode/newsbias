0," (CNN)After more than 25 hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse of all five charges he faced after fatally shooting two people and wounding a third during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last summer. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, were killed, and Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, was wounded. Rittenhouse was charged with five felonies: first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety.The two-week trial -- which captured America's attention and was in many ways emblematic of the divided nation -- featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including Rittenhouse himself, video clips from the night of the shootings and heated exchanges between the attorneys and the judge. And while the jury's decision drew harsh criticism from the victims' loved ones, legal experts say they were not surprised by the verdict. These were the factors experts said helped lead to Rittenhouse's acquittal. Rittenhouse's testimony was keyAmong the trial's most key moments was the testimony from Rittenhouse, who told the court he acted in self-defense when he shot Rosenbaum, who he said threatened him earlier, chased him, threw a bag at him and lunged for his gun. At one point, 18-year-old Rittenhouse broke down in tears while on the stand.""If I would have let Mr. Rosenbaum take my firearm from me, he would have used it and killed me with it and probably killed more people,"" he testified.Rittenhouse referred to the other people he shot at as part of a ""mob"" chasing him, telling the court Huber came at him, struck him with a skateboard, and grabbed his gun. Rittenhouse shot him once in the chest, killing him. Finally, he said he saw Grosskreutz lunge at him and point a pistol at his head, so Rittenhouse shot him, he testified. Defense attorney Mark Richards told reporters Friday in his mind, 'it wasn't a close call' whether to put Rittenhouse on the stand. ""We had a mock jury and we did two different juries, one with him testifying and one without him testifying. It was substantially better when he testified... and that sealed it,"" Richards said. ""If you don't put a client on the stand, you're going to lose, period.""His testimony was key for several reasons, according to legal experts. ""Number one, you humanize him... More important, number two, he explained his uses of force,"" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. Rittenhouse's testimony gave jurors the ability to hear what he thought at the time and whether he believed he was in danger -- a claim the prosecution, ultimately failed to undermine, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said.""They (prosecutors) pointed out some sort of minor inconsistencies and things he said on the night of, and said later, but nothing that undermines sort of the core defense argument, which was, he was attacked,"" Honig told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Friday. ""Every time he shot, he was attacked.""""The prosecution did not make enough of a dent in Kyle Rittenhouse,"" Honig added.State did not prove Rittenhouse provoked violenceWhat the trial came down to, according to civil rights attorney Charles F. Coleman Jr. were two competing narratives: one of Rittenhouse being a victim who was attacked, and one of being a vigilante who provoked the violence.""The jury bought the narrative of Kyle Rittenhouse being a victim, they thought that his self-defense claim was a lot stronger than the prosecution's provocation claim,"" he said. Wisconsin law allows the use of deadly force only if ""necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm."" And because Rittenhouse's attorneys claimed self-defense, state law meant the burden fell on prosecutors to disprove Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. And it was an uphill battle to climb from the start, because of the facts in this case, experts said.""(Prosecutors) weren't able to show that his response to each of these men, to each of these sets of threats was unreasonable,"" criminal defense attorney Sara Azari told CNN's Pamela Brown.""When the jury came back a couple days ago and watched the videos... frame by frame, they were looking to see whether Kyle did something to provoke the threat and whether his response to that threat was reasonable in terms of using deadly force and they agreed with the defense that it was,"" Azari added.In addition, testimony from the trial challenged many assumptions previously surrounding the case and even some testimony from the state's witnesses supported Rittenhouse's self-defense claim, said criminal defense attorney Bob Bianchi. Former Marine Jason Lackowski, who testified for the state, said Rosenbaum acted ""belligerently"" and asked to be shot but was not perceived as a serious threat. Richie McGinniss, a video editor with The Daily Caller news site, testified Rosenbaum had lunged for the front of Rittenhouse's rifle moments before he was shot. Grosskreutz, who was wounded, testified he pointed a pistol at Rittenhouse and later clarified to the prosecution during redirect questioning he never intentionally pointed his gun at Rittenhouse.""The prosecution ... has to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt to all 12 jurors. How do you do that when you saw no real provocation going on?"" Bianchi said. ""There wasn't a real trial lawyer ... that didn't sit here and say this is an amazingly good self-defense case.""Prosecutors also took misstepsThere were mistakes the state made as well, including overselling the case by trying to paint Rittenhouse as an active shooter, Honig, the former federal prosecutor, said.In his closing arguments earlier this week, Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said Rittenhouse behaved in a way no reasonable person would, provoked the incident, fired his gun recklessly, lied numerous times and as a result, the crowd had a right ""to try and stop an active shooter.""""Trying to brand Kyle Rittenhouse as an active shooter did not stand up and the defense came back and showed, here he is walking through the streets, he's not shooting indiscriminately, that's what an active shooter does, he's only shooting people who have attacked him first,"" Honig said. Rittenhouse's defense attorney also pointed to the prosecution's active shooter argument during his news conference, saying, ""justice is done when the truth is reached.""""A prosecutor is supposed to seek the truth,"" Richards added. In addition, trying to paint Rittenhouse as provocative because he brought an AR-15 firearm did not work because of the culture of guns in Wisconsin, which aren't necessarily always equated with criminal activity, legal experts told CNN.'You've got to remember you're in a jurisdiction where this is not an unusual thing,"" Bianchi said.Honig added the prosecution team made other mistakes, which led to heated exchanges with Judge Bruce Schroeder. The judge twice admonished Binger for his line of questioning -- once for implicating Rittenhouse's silence after his arrest (a right guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment) and later for touching on questions related to an incident the judge had ruled would not be permitted to come into evidence.""That is an absolute amateur move by the prosecutors,"" Honig said. Jury instructions were consequential, expert saysFinally, the jury instructions also helped lead to Rittenhouse's acquittal, CNN senior legal analyst Laura Coates said.Coates said the instructions said jurors had to look at the case through the eyes of then 17-year-old Rittenhouse, not in hindsight, and assess the reasonableness of his actions.""The jury instructions were really centered around that term 'reasonable.' Defining the word 'reasonable.' And the jury instructions required this jury to look through the lens and perspective of Kyle Rittenhouse. Not Monday morning quarterback, not the jurors, or the court of public opinion in hindsight,"" Coates said. ""What would he reasonably and what did he reasonably believe about the possibility of a lethal threat or harm and grave bodily harm?""That, in combination with having to disprove Rittenhouse's self-defense claim and show he provoked the violence during the chaotic night, meant the""deck was stacked against"" prosecutors, Coates said.""With all that combined, it's not surprising that an acquittal happened, but it came down really to that jury instruction about looking through the eyes of Kyle Rittenhouse,"" Coates said.

1," (CNN)Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who killed two people and shot another during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was acquitted Friday of first-degree intentional homicide and four other felony charges. Rittenhouse, wearing a dark jacket with a burgundy tie and shirt, stood behind the defense table as each not guilty verdict was read. He tried to hold back tears, then sobbed and appeared to collapse forward on the table, where his attorney embraced him. In a video promoting a Tucker Carlson Originals special on the case, Rittenhouse tells someone as he is apparently driven away from the courthouse: ""The jury reached the correct verdict. Self-defense is not illegal. And I believe they came to the correct verdict and I'm glad that everything went well. ""It's been a rough journey, but we made it through it. We made it through the hard part.""Carlson's crew has been embedded with the teen throughout the trial and the Fox News host will interview Rittenhouse on his Monday show. The documentary will air in December on the Fox Nation streaming service, Fox News said.Rittenhouse's mother gasped after the final verdict was read, her head falling into her hands. The panel of five men and seven women deliberated more than 25 hours over the past four days in a closely-watched case that polarized an already divided nation. The verdict cannot be appealed.These are the five charges the jury consideredGov. Tony Evers, in a statement, called for peace on the streets and said the trial has ""reopened wounds that have not yet fully healed.""During their deliberations, jurors requested to rewatch much of the video evidence of the shootings. In the end, they agreed with Rittenhouse's testimony that he feared for his life and acted in self-defense. Verdict sheets filed with the Kenosha County Clerk of the Circuit Court showed the presiding juror in the case signed the not guilty verdicts to the five charges on different dates. Three verdict sheets were dated Wednesday and Thursday.  The most severe charge Rittenhouse faced was a first-degree intentional homicide charge for the fatal shooting of Anthony Huber: count 4. Juror 54 signed the verdict sheet for that count Wednesday.The two sheets signed Friday involved the fatal shooting of Joseph Rosenbaum and the charge of reckless endangerment of a man who was near Rittenhouse during the shooting.Judge praises jurySince the shootings on August 25, 2020, the case pitted Americans who saw Rittenhouse as an armed teen vigilante against those who viewed him as a citizen taking up arms to protect businesses from looters and rioters.The judge praised the jurors, saying he ""couldn't have asked for a better jury."" Some jurors appeared fatigued as the verdicts were read -- their hands on their chins or rubbing their eyes, according to a pool reporter. Others seemed ill-at-ease, arms folded across their chests. Things we've learned from the trial that challenge assumptions about the caseWhat's next for RittenhouseRittenhouse attorney Mark Richards said outside court that his client was on his way home and ""wants to get on with his life."" ""He has a huge sense of relief,"" Richards told reporters. ""He wishes none of this would have ever happened. But, as he said when he testified, he did not start this and we're thankful in more ways than one that the jury finally got to hear the true story.""Richards said the decision to put Rittenhouse on the stand ""wasn't a close call."" ""In Wisconsin, if you don't put a client on the stand, you're going to lose. Period,"" Richards added. The attorney said Rittenhouse has had 24-hour security and does not expect to continue to live in the area.""I think eventually some anonymity will come,"" Richards said. David Hancock, a spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, told CNN affiliate WBBM the ""goal is to ensure Kyle's safety as he moves on as an 18-year-old young man in college studying to be a nurse.""Here's what we know about the three men Rittenhouse shotProsecutor 'disappointed' with verdict After the verdict, lead prosecutor Thomas Binger told the court, ""The jury has represented our community in this trial and has spoken.""Binger, in a statement, said, ""While we are disappointed with the verdict, it must be respected... We ask that members of our community continue to express their opinions and feelings about this verdict in a civil and peaceful manner.""Huber's family said in a statement ""there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son."" ""It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,"" the statement said of the verdict.""We hope that decent people will join us in forcefully rejecting that message and demanding more of our laws, our officials, and our justice system.""Huber's girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, was not surprised by the verdict. ""We know that this system is a failure,"" she said.Rosenbaum's fiancée, Kariann Swart, said, ""In this case, the victims' lives don't matter.""Kimberley Motley and Milo Schwab, attorneys for Gaige Grosskreutz and Rosenbaum's estate, said they will continue to seek justice.""While today's verdict may mean justice delayed, it will not mean justice denied,"" they said in a statement. ""We are committed to uncovering the truth of that night and holding those responsible to account.""Prosecution faced uphill battle  The high-profile verdict generated mixed reactions, from the White House to the streets of Wisconsin. President Joe Biden, in a statement, said the verdict ""will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included"" but added people ""must acknowledge that the jury has spoken."" On a cold, sunny afternoon, mostly peaceful crowds gathered outside the courthouse. Protests were planned in several US cities Friday and Saturday, according to social media posts.  ""We want the nation to know the nation that you live in now isn't the ... United States that we used to live in,"" said Justin Blake, uncle of Jacob Blake, whose shooting by police last summer sparked the protests where Rittenhouse showed up with his gun. The prosecution faced an uphill challenge from the start because Wisconsin law requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Rittenhouse did not act in self-defense. But there are limits to a self-defense claim. ""The defendant may intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if the defendant reasonably believed that the force used was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself,"" the jury instructions explain.One of the videos the jury asked to rewatch -- a drone video showing Rittenhouse shooting Rosenbaum -- was at the heart of a defense request for a mistrial in the case.The deliberations came after a two-week trial highlighted by emotional and compelling testimony from Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old at the center of debates around self-defense, gun ownership and Black Lives Matter demonstrations. On the stand, he told jurors -- and the viewing public -- he acted in self-defense.""I didn't do anything wrong. I defended myself,"" he testified.Rittenhouse was charged with five felonies: first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety. Jurors also considered lesser offenses for two of the five counts. If convicted on the most serious charge, Rittenhouse faced a mandatory sentence of life in prison.Schroeder dismissed a misdemeanor weapons possession charge and a non-criminal curfew violation prior to deliberations.The charges stem from the chaotic unrest last year in the wake of the Kenosha police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man. After instances of rioting and fiery destruction, Rittenhouse, 17 at the time, took a medical kit and an AR-15-style rifle and joined up with a group of other armed people in Kenosha on August 25. There, Rittenhouse fatally shot Rosenbaum -- who was chasing the teenager and threw a bag at him -- and then tried to flee. A crowd of people pursued the teenager, and Rittenhouse shot at an unidentified man who kicked him; fatally shot Huber, who had hit him with a skateboard; and wounded Grosskreutz, who was armed with a pistol. What happened in the trialProsecutors called 22 witnesses over the course of six days as they sought to show Rittenhouse acted recklessly that night and provoked Rosenbaum by pointing the rifle at him, setting off the ensuing series of events.""That is what provokes this entire incident,"" Binger said in closing arguments. ""When the defendant provokes this incident, he loses the right to self-defense. You cannot claim self-defense against a danger you create.""The prosecution portrayed the three other people who confronted the teen as ""heroes"" trying to stop what they believed to be an active shooting. Binger also questioned the teenager's decision to take a gun into the city in the first place, calling him a ""chaos tourist.""On the stand, Rittenhouse testified he was defending himself when he shot four times at Rosenbaum, who he said had threatened him earlier, chased him, thrown a bag at him and lunged for his gun. Rittenhouse also referred to the three other people he shot at as part of a ""mob"" chasing him.He became emotional and broke down into tears during his testimony as he began to recount the initial shooting, leading to a break in the case. In closing arguments, defense attorney Richards said Rittenhouse feared for his life when he opened fire.""Every person who was shot was attacking Kyle. One with a skateboard, one with his hands, and one with his feet, one with a gun,"" Richards said. ""Hands and feet can cause great bodily harm.""The trial featured more than a dozen videos from the night that showed what happened before, during and after the shootings. Most of the facts of what happened that night were not up for debate -- rather, at the heart of the trial was the analysis of Rittenhouse's actions and whether they can be considered ""reasonable.""",0
2," (CNN)Kyle Rittenhouse, on trial this month for killing two unarmed men and injuring another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last summer, was acquitted Friday on all counts -- including first-degree intentional homicide and four other felony charges -- after the jury deliberated for more than 25 hours. The trial came down to two dueling narratives. To the prosecutors, Rittenhouse was a vigilante with an AR-15-style weapon who went looking for trouble. To the defense, Rittenhouse was the sobbing teenager who testified that he found himself under attack and in those lightning-fast moments made a reasonable decision to protect himself. The jury clearly believed the latter, which, given the facts, the law and other circumstances of the trial, is no surprise. This case was always going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors. The key issue was whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, which means that he reasonably feared for his life when he pulled the trigger and shot Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz that night. Trying to weigh Rittenhouse's self-defense claim amid the two dueling narratives was not an easy job for the jury. One could reasonably argue that Rittenhouse provoked the attacks on him by openly carrying his weapon in a threatening manner, and that he had the option to retreat or otherwise avoid using deadly force, even if defending himself. If the jury had found either of these things to be true, it would have defeated the self-defense claim. But there was also evidence -- including the critical videos of the events in question and the testimony of Rittenhouse himself -- that in the key moments right before he pulled the trigger, Rittenhouse acted in response to imminent threats to his personal safety because he believed he was in danger. The laws and applicable legal standards also created a tough road for prosecutors trying to win a conviction here. Our criminal justice system generally favors the defendant, because of our core belief that it is better to see a guilty man go free than to convict an innocent one. Thus in criminal cases, prosecutors carry the highest burden of proof known to our legal system: proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Like in many other states, Wisconsin law is sympathetic to homicide defendants claiming self-defense. Once a defendant raises self-defense as an issue, it requires prosecutors to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Finally, Judge Bruce Schroeder, who presided over the case with a mercurial demeanor and frequent tongue-lashings, didn't make things easy for the prosecutors. The judge's behavior seemed to some to betray a pro-Rittenhouse bias -- for example, when he ruled that prosecutors would not be allowed to refer to Rittenhouse's victims as ""victims"" and encouraged a round of applause for a defense witness on the stand because he was a veteran. We don't know exactly what the jury's reasoning was in rendering its verdict -- jury deliberations happen in secret, so unless jurors choose to discuss the experience afterward, we will not get a view into how they made their decisions or what pieces of evidence were most compelling to them. But it appears that with evidence supporting both narratives, the jurors concluded that the prosecution failed to meet its burden -- and based on this record, it's impossible to find fault with that. This issue -- whether a defendant acted reasonably in a stressful moment -- is a quintessential jury question. This is exactly why we have a jury system where 12 members of the community come together to judge their fellow man. We, as a democracy, prefer the law to be administered by a group of ordinary individuals who rely on common sense and everyday experiences to reach a collective decision.  Without question, Rittenhouse did not have to be in Kenosha with his weapon strapped across his body as he ran around the streets in what was clearly an unpredictable and ultimately dangerous situation. If he had exercised better judgment and decided not to go that night, Rosenbaum and Huber would almost certainly still be alive. But in Wisconsin, that initial decision, as poor a decision as it was, does not constitute a crime, and the jury found his later actions justified.Those of us who don't want to have to worry about whether people like Kyle Rittenhouse will continue to brandish guns at public gatherings, thereby greatly increasing the danger of violence, should direct our energy toward changing the open carry laws in Wisconsin. Public sentiment after an episode that is viewed as unfair -- and there are plenty of people who are incensed that Rittenhouse went free because of a self-defense claim when he placed himself in the situation in the first place -- can spark change. For example, in Georgia, after the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, the legislature repealed the citizen's arrest law that Arbery's alleged killer and his co-defendants are relying on for their defense (although the defendants in the Arbery killing are still able to assert it). If public concern about Rittenhouse's conduct and its results leads to a re-examination of Wisconsin's gun laws, that will be one positive thing to come out of this tragic episode. ",0
3," (CNN)Kyle Rittenhouse's homicide trial in Wisconsin was highlighted by the emotional testimony of the 18-year-old man whose actions as a minor have become emblematic of a divided America. Rittenhouse was acquitted on all charges by a jury Friday related to the unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, were killed, and Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, was wounded.Ever since Rittenhouse fatally shot Rosenbaum and Huber and wounded Grosskreutz just before midnight on August 25, 2020, the case has been seen by many as an example of vigilante justice carried out by an armed teen. Others viewed what happened during a night of unrest in Kenosha as the actions of a citizen taking up arms to protect businesses from looters and rioters. Trial testimony challenged many assumptions surrounding the case. Here is what we've learned from the trial: Was Rittenhouse an outsider in Kenosha that night?After the shooting, Rittenhouse was portrayed in some quarters as an outsider who showed up in Kenosha and had no business being on the street during nights of unrest. Rittenhouse testified that he lived in Antioch, Illinois, with his mother, while his father lived in Kenosha. Antioch is just across the Illinois border.He had worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha, was part of a police explorer program and knew CPR and basic life support, according to his testimony. Rittenhouse was staying with his friend Dominick Black, who was dating the defendant's sister and testified for the prosecution.Rittenhouse later said he knew he was not old enough to legally buy a firearm, so he asked Black to do so on his behalf.The night of the shooting, Black and Rittenhouse each took a weapon and ammo and went to downtown Kenosha to try to protect a car dealership called Car Source, Black testified, where about six or seven other armed people had gathered.Black testified that he climbed atop the roof of the dealership because he felt being on the ground was too dangerous. At one point, he said he heard gunshots go off in the distance in an area where Rittenhouse was.Nicholas Smith, the first defense witness, testified that Anmol ""Sam"" Khindri, one of the owners of Car Source, had asked him to help protect the dealership. Smith's testimony contradicted Khindri and his brother, who told jurors they never asked anyone to protect the car lot.Smith, 23, said he reached out to Rittenhouse's friend after he came across a video posted on Snapchat showing Black at the protests the previous night.Was he there to treat the injured? According to Rittenhouse's own testimony, he lied about being an EMT on the night of the shooting. He testified that he is studying nursing at Arizona State University. At one point during cross-examination, the jury was shown a video in which Rittenhouse falsely tells the camera he was a certified emergency medical technician. ""I told him I was an EMT but I wasn't,"" Rittenhouse testified.In closing arguments, the state labeled Rittenhouse a ""fraud"" and compared him to a ""quack doctor"" who lied about his medical experience. Did he bring the weapon across state lines?After the shooting and his arrest, many people questioned whether the then-minor had transported the illegal gun across state lines. Black testified he had previously purchased an AR-15 firearm for Rittenhouse in Wisconsin.Rittenhouse was too young to purchase and possess a gun, but he agreed to pay Black for the firearm, Black told jurors.Black testified that he also had his own firearm, and they had fired the weapons in target practice in a rural area.Black has been charged with two counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to a person under the age of 18 causing death, according to court records. He has pleaded not guilty. He testified that he hoped taking the stand would lead to leniency in his case.On Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the misdemeanor weapons charge against Rittenhouse, now 18.The charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18 was punishable by up to nine months in prison. The count was thrown out due to the odd wording of Wisconsin's gun laws.Schroeder dismissed the misdemeanor charge, noting that the weapon was longer than the measurements required for it to be an illegal ""short-barreled rifle"" under state law. Wisconsin law states, ""any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.""A subsection of the statute adds, in part, ""This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28.""The 941.28 subsections state the illegality would only apply to those armed with a ""short-barreled rifle,"" which is also defined as ""a rifle having one or more barrels having a length of less than 16 inches"" and ""a rifle having an overall length of less than 26 inches.""Were his victims rioting? Rittenhouse fatally shot Rosenbaum -- who was chasing the teenager and threw a bag at him -- and then tried to flee. A crowd of people pursued the teenager, and Rittenhouse shot at an unidentified man who tried to kick him. He then fatally shot Huber, who had hit him with a skateboard, according to trial testimony and video evidence presented. He wounded Grosskreutz, a paramedic who was armed with a pistol and later testified pointing it at Rittenhouse. On redirect questioning by the prosecution, Grosskreutz clarified that he never intentionally pointed his gun at Rittenhouse.The prosecution portrayed people who confronted the teen as ""heroes"" trying to stop what they believed to be an active shooting. Prosecutor Thomas Binger, in closing arguments, told the jury that Rosenbaum had tipped over an empty Porta Potty, swung a chain, lit a metal garbage dumpster and wooden trailer on fire, and used the N-word the night of the shooting. ""If he were alive today ... I'd probably try to prosecute him for arson. But I can't because the defendant killed him,"" Binger told jurors. Binger added, ""When you commit arson, we prosecute. We don't execute you on the street.""Rittenhouse testified he acted in self-defense when he shot four times at Rosenbaum, who he said had threatened him earlier, chased him, thrown a bag at him and lunged for his gun.Jason Lackowski, a former Marine who testified for the state, said Rosenbaum acted ""belligerently"" and asked to be shot but was not perceived as a serious threat. Rittenhouse referred to the three other people he shot at as part of a ""mob"" chasing him.In closing arguments, defense attorney Mark Richards said Rittenhouse feared for his life when he pulled the trigger.""Every person who was shot was attacking Kyle. One with a skateboard, one with his hands, and one with his feet, one with a gun,"" Richards said. ""Hands and feet can cause great bodily harm.""Grosskreutz testified he pulled out his own firearm because he believed Rittenhouse was an active shooter. He said was a trained paramedic and treated about 10 people that night, including one who had a serious cut after being hit by a rubber bullet.During his testimony, Rittenhouse said Huber was ""holding a skateboard like a baseball bat,"" which he swung down, hitting Rittenhouse in the neck. Richards, the defense attorney, said before Rittenhouse shot Huber, the shooting victim ""strikes him in the head"" and is going for a ""second lick,"" adding Huber's ""other hand goes for the gun"" in Rittenhouse's hand.Binger asked jurors to contrast the teen's behavior with Huber's actions.""A man who was there because he knew Jacob Blake, who carried his skateboard everywhere, and who rushed towards danger to save other people's lives,"" Binger said, referring to Huber.Is he a member of a White supremacist group? There was no evidence presented at trial about this. Before trial, Schroeder sided with the defense in denying motions by prosecutors seeking to admit evidence showing what they say was Rittenhouse's alleged association with the Proud Boys, a far-right group linked to political violence.The state claimed that months after the Kenosha shooting, Rittenhouse went to a local bar with his mother about 90 minutes after his arraignment. Rittenhouse posed for pictures with individuals seen flashing the ""OK"" sign, which prosecutors said has been co-opted as a sign of ""White power"" by known White supremacist groups.Prosecutors argued that some of the people he posed with were in the ""highest echelons"" of the Wisconsin chapter of the Proud Boys.The defense argued there was no evidence Rittenhouse knew who they were. The judge agreed. ""For me to let that in as evidence for a motive that existed four months earlier? Can't see it,"" Schroeder said.",0
4," (CNN)Kyle Rittenhouse -- accused of shooting three people, two fatally -- was acquitted on all charges on Friday by a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The 12 jurors found him not guilty for the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, using an AR-15-type rifle during protests on August 25, 2020, that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Defense lawyers said Rittenhouse, then 17, was acting in self-defense.The jury also found Rittenhouse, now 18, not guilty of two felony charges of recklessly endangering safety. Rittenhouse took the stand and testified before the jury that he acted in self-defense. During emotional testimony, he broke down in tears as he recounted the shootings during the chaotic night of unrest. The prosecution sought to show Rittenhouse acted criminally and recklessly.   Here's what we know about the two men killed and the sole survivor of the shootings.Joseph RosenbaumOn the night of August 25, 2020, Kenosha's streets were filled with crowds protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake, who was shot seven times in the back and side by a Kenosha police officer who said he was trying to detain him.During those demonstrations, Rittenhouse clashed with a crowd gathered near a car dealership and Rosenbaum, who did not have a firearm, threw an object that appeared to be a plastic bag at him and missed, according to a criminal complaint filed last year. Videos played at trial showed Rosenbaum throwing the plastic bag at Rittenhouse. His fiancée testified Rosenbaum had just be discharged from a hospital in Milwaukee and was carrying papers, socks, deodorant, a toothbrush and toothpaste in the bag. Rosenbaum had been discharged from the hospital after a suicide attempt, according to The Washington Post.Kariann Swart, Rosenbaum's fiancée, testified they were both homeless when they met in 2019 and were living in a motel at the time Rosenbaum was killed. ""We just spent a lot of time talking, getting to know one another, and laughing and joking around. He was a very animated person like that,"" she said.She said Rosenbaum was on an antidepressant and medication she said was used to treat his bipolar disorder.Several clips played during the trial captured Rosenbaum briefly chasing Rittenhouse in a Car Source dealership before Rittenhouse fired four shots at him. Kenosha Police Detective Martin Howard testified one of the videos showed Rosenbaum hiding as Rittenhouse approached the lot and then Rosenbaum beginning to follow him.Rosenbaum and Rittenhouse moved across the parking lot and appeared to be close to each other when loud bangs were suddenly heard and Rosenbaum fell to the ground, the complaint said. Dr. Douglas Kelley with the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office testified Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum four times -- twice in the front, once in the back and once along the side of his head, and determined the fatal shot to his back came as his body leaned forward.As Rosenbaum lay on the ground, Rittenhouse made a call on his cellphone and said, ""I just killed somebody"" as he ran away, the complaint alleged.Defense attorney Mark Richards argued in court Rittenhouse feared for his life when he fatally shot Rosenbaum, describing Rosenbaum as the aggressor. But prosecutor Thomas Binger said during closing arguments Rittenhouse provoked the shooting by pointing his weapon at Rosenbaum and should have continued to run away instead of shooting.""When the defendant provokes this incident, he loses the right to self-defense,"" Binger said."" You cannot claim self-defense against a danger you create.""Rittenhouse testified he knew Rosenbaum was unarmed when he ran at the teenager and said he pointed his rifle at Rosenbaum in an attempt to deter him, adding he knew pointing a rifle at someone is dangerous.Rosenbaum had spent more than a decade in prison in Arizona after being convicted of sexual conduct with a minor. ""He wasn't down there as a rioter or a looter,"" Rosenbaum's fiancée previously told the Post in reference to August 25. ""Why was he there? I have no answer. I ask myself that question every day.""A verified GoFundMe page said Rosenbaum had a daughter. Anthony HuberHuber, who was in the crowd of protesters with his girlfriend, was killed as Rittenhouse fled the scene of Rosenbaum's shooting, according to the complaint. Huber had turned 26 just four days earlier, according to an obituary. Huber spotted the armed man in the crowded street and he ran toward danger, his girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, told CNN in an interview last year. ""He pushed me out of the way and ran off. I tried to grab him,"" Hannah Gittings said.Videos from the scene show Rittenhouse carrying an AR-15-style rifle, walking the city's streets with a group of armed men. Gittings told CNN her boyfriend launched at the armed individual to protect her and other people nearby.Huber appeared to reach for Rittenhouse's gun with his hand while holding his skateboard in the other, the criminal complaint said. As Huber tried to grab the gun, Rittenhouse pointed it at his body and fired one round, according to the complaint. Huber was seen staggering away and then fell to the ground, the complaint said. He died from his gunshot wound. During his testimony, Rittenhouse said Huber was ""holding a skateboard like a baseball bat,"" which he swung down, hitting Rittenhouse in the neck. Richards, the defense attorney, said before Rittenhouse shot Huber, the shooting victim ""strikes him in the head"" and is going for a ""second lick,"" adding Huber's ""other hand goes for the gun"" in Rittenhouse's hand.DNA analyst Amber Rasmussen testified Huber's DNA was not found on Rittenhouse's firearm but said it was still possible he touched out.Huber was ""completely indescribable"" and stood by his beliefs and convictions, Gittings, his girlfriend, said last year. ""He was an incredibly intelligent person, literally the smartest person I've ever met,"" Gittings said. ""He knew exactly what was at risk for him chasing down somebody with a weapon.""Huber was born and raised in Kenosha, said Anand Swaminathan, an attorney for his family. ""He loved Kenosha,"" Swaminathan said. ""In the years leading up to this event he was making a good life and he was having fun and he was happy and he was trying to do the most he could with himself.""Huber struggled with mental health challenges when he was younger and skateboarding was among the things that brought him the most joy. He had found a community of people in Kenosha who shared the same passion, the attorney added. ""It was something that brought him a lot of happiness, brought him a lot of peace,"" Swaminathan said. ""He had really fought to get himself to a healthy place.""People who talk about Huber talk about ""a kid who wanted to help people,"" the attorney added. ""His family feels like that nature in him is part of why he took the actions he did that night, he wanted to help, he wanted to stop this person,"" he said. This week, Binger, with the prosecution, asked the jury to consider Rittenhouse's true motivations and to contrast the teen's behavior with Huber's behavior.""A man who was there because he knew Jacob Blake, who carried his skateboard everywhere, and who rushed towards danger to save other people's lives,"" Binger said, referring to Huber.Huber's father filed a federal lawsuit in August 2021 accusing Kenosha authorities of deputizing the armed people who were patrolling the streets and conspiring with them, alleging their actions ""directly caused"" Huber's death and were a ""license for the armed individuals to wreak havoc and inflict injury."" CNN reached out to Kenosha police, the city of Kenosha and a representative of the county. The Kenosha County Sheriff's Department declined to comment.Gaige Grosskreutz Rittenhouse shot and injured Grosskreutz, who approached him shortly after Huber was shot, the criminal complaint alleged. Grosskreutz testified he was at the protest to provide medical care, and had packed his medical supplies, including a tourniquet and gauze, as well as his handgun, as he routinely did at other demonstrations.He testified that on the night of the shootings, he believed Rittenhouse was an active shooter, saying ""people were pointing out the defendant, saying he had just shot somebody, that he's trying to get away."" At some point, Grosskreutz  testified, he drew his pistol. During cross-examination by Rittenhouse's attorney, Grosskreutz said his handgun was pointing at Rittenhouse during the shooting. On redirect questioning by the prosecution, he clarified he never intentionally pointed his gun at Rittenhouse.He said he saw Rittenhouse fire at Huber and then moved toward Rittenhouse, telling jurors his hands were up, holding his own gun and phone. Grosskreutz said he ""thought there was a high likelihood that I would be shot myself."" Richards, the defense attorney, argued Grosskreutz should have ""retreated"" and not confronted Rittenhouse.This week, Binger, the prosecutor, showed Grosskreutz's shooting frame-by-frame which shows him appear to retreat before Rittenhouse is seen aiming his gun at him from two to three feet away. Once Grosskreutz was shot, the bullet severing his bicep, his arm lowered in an involuntary action, the prosecutor said.""At this point, yeah, absolutely. That right arm is probably dangling down towards the defendant,"" Binger said. ""It's not going to be able to pull that trigger without a working bicep muscle, and it's not a voluntary thing. It's done because the defendant just blew his arm off.""Grosskreutz was wearing his ""paramedic"" hat that night. He said his goal during the protest was to provide medical care to anyone who needed it. He had trained as a paramedic before deciding to attend a liberal arts college in Wisconsin.""While my work as a paramedic was important to the community I felt it was reactive: somebody gets shot, somebody overdoses,"" Grosskreutz told CNN's Sara Sidner in a September 2020 interview. ""I wanted to further my understanding of the world and further educate myself and then be on the proactive side. Stop people from getting shot, stop people from overdosing.""Since the shooting, he told CNN he had to undergo several surgeries and treatments.""I'm missing 90% of my bicep,"" he said last year. ""This has not been easy emotionally, physically. I'm in constant pain, like excruciating pain that just doesn't go away -- both in my arm, in my heart.""In October, Grosskreutz also sued the city and county of Kenosha and many of its officers alleging ""Kenosha law enforcement officers and white nationalist militia persons discussed and coordinated strategy"" that led to the shooting. The lawsuit said Grosskreutz had a tourniquet in his medic bag the night he was shot, adding ""but for his training as an EMT, Grosskreutz would have likely been Rittenhouse's third killing.""""Nonetheless, Grosskreutz's life has been changed immeasurably.""CNN reached out to the former police chief, the city of Kenosha and its police department. An attorney representing the Kenosha County sheriff and the county said they plan to file a motion dismissing the case.  ",0
5," (CNN)The question of who can or should get booster doses of coronavirus vaccines is much simpler now.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration have okayed boosters for every adult who got Moderna's or Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine six months ago or longer.The agencies had already said everyone who got Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine two months ago or more should get a booster. Friday's decision means everyone 18 and older who is fully vaccinated should consider getting another dose of vaccine.Previous guidance was more complicated and CDC vaccine advisers expressed relief at the idea that the advice would be more streamlined.""The current guidelines, so well intentioned and thoughtful, generate an obstacle to uptake of boosters. In pursuit of precision, they create confusion,"" Dr. Nirav Shah, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and director of Maine's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told Friday's meeting of CDC vaccine advisers before they voted to recommend broader guidelines.""Our concern is that eligible individuals are not receiving boosters right now because of this confusion.""SO WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR BOOSTERS NOW?Anyone who's at least 18 and was fully vaccinated at least six months ago. For those who got Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine, that means two doses. The CDC and FDA had already recommended that anyone who got Johnson & Johnson's Janssen one-shot vaccine two months ago or longer should get a booster dose.In most cases, people should be able to get a free booster vaccine by showing a CDC vaccination card.WHICH VACCINE SHOULD PEOPLE GET?The authorization to mix and match vaccines still applies, so it doesn't matter. People who got two doses of Pfizer vaccine may either get a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, or they may opt for a Moderna booster, which is a half-sized dose of the regular Moderna dose, or they can get a Johnson & Johnson booster. The same goes for all the vaccines. Plus, people who got a vaccine that has not been authorized in the US -- for example, an AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe or the Caribbean—may get a booster dose of Pfizer's vaccine in the US.Studies show that any of the three vaccines, given as boosters, bump people's immunity back up to levels provided after the second dose. For the J&J vaccine, a booster makes immunity stronger than it was after the first dose.Data presented to CDC's vaccine advisers Friday showed booster shots of either Moderna's or Pfizer's vaccine were safe, caused no worrying side-effects, and revved up people's immune responses regardless of age.One consistent pattern: Moderna's booster caused more immediate reactions such as sore arms, fatigue and headaches. Even at the half-sized booster dose, Moderna's product delivers more vaccine than Pfizer's full-sized dose does -- 50 micrograms versus 30 micrograms -- and doctors say it's possible that accounts for the difference. But there were no concerning safety reports from either, according to CDC vaccine safety specialists.HOW LONG UNTIL THE BOOSTER PROTECTS ME?As with the second dose of vaccine, doctors say it takes two weeks for immunity to peak. So the CDC is recommending that people get their boosters as soon as possible.People who have not received boosters yet won't be able to get one in time to achieve peak renewed immunity before Thanksgiving, but other holidays are coming and the prospect of winter travel has officials worried.WHAT ABOUT TEENS AND CHILDREN?The biggest risks from waning immunity are to older adults -- especially those 65 and older. That's why the FDA and CDC acted first for that age group, as well as for people otherwise at risk of severe disease, such as those with medical conditions, even if they are younger.The companies that make the vaccines have not reported any evidence that people 18 and under who got vaccinated are suffering from waning immunity or breakthrough infections yet. These younger age groups are less at risk of severe disease overall, and there's less of a concern about the danger to them from breakthrough infections.Pfizer's vaccine was authorized for children as young as 12 in May, which would put some children that age at the six-month mark. But the CDC and FDA are far more concerned about getting boosters to adults first -- and, most important, getting the first shots into the millions of adults and children who are authorized to be vaccinated but who haven't been yet.DOES THIS CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF WHO'S FULLY VACCINATED?Not in the United States. The CDC defines a fully vaccinated person as someone two weeks after having received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at least three weeks apart, two doses of Moderna's vaccine four weeks apart or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. That hasn't changed.At least two governors -- New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham and Connecticut's Ned Lamont, both Democrats, have said they don't consider people fully vaccinated unless they've had a booster, but so far those are opinions, not policies.IF I GET A BOOSTER, AM I DONE FOREVER?It's too soon to say. It's possible that as with vaccines like the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, once the initial few doses are out of the way, people can count on being immune for life. Doctors hope that boosting six months after the initial dose will provide much longer-lasting immunity than giving two quick doses a few weeks apart -- even as they agree that was 100% the right approach for a new vaccine being used at the start of a pandemic. It's also too soon to know whether immunity might wane after months or years. And it's too soon to know if a new variant might emerge and spread that evades the protection offered by a vaccine and, as with flu vaccines every year, the formula may have to be tweaked protect against the changed virus.",0
6," (CNN)Earlier this week in an interview with onetime Trump White House political guru Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows said aloud what lots of Trump-y types have been thinking for a while.Meadows, who served as Trump's White House chief of staff, said that if Republicans regain the House majority in 2022, they should install the former President as speaker in January 2023. ""I would love to see the gavel go from (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi to Donald Trump,"" Meadows told Bannon. ""You talk about melting down -- people would go crazy.""Meadows may be the most prominent Trump ally to float the idea, but he isn't the first.In June, the former President had this exchange with conservative radio talk-show host Wayne Allyn Root:ROOT: ""Why not, instead of just waiting for 2024, and I'm hoping you run in 2024, but why not run in 2022 for the United States Congress, a House seat in Florida, win big, lead us to a dramatic landslide victory, taking the House by 50 seats, and then you become the speaker of the House?"" TRUMP: ""You know, it's very interesting. That's so interesting. And people have said, run for the Senate, OK, run for the Senate, but you know what? Your idea might be better. It's very interesting.""In a subsequent interview with Fox News, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy seemed to give the idea even more credence.""You know, I have talked to President Trump many times,"" McCarthy told Fox's Brian Kilmeade. ""He tells me he wants to be speaker, and I think he should be president.""(McCarthy's office subsequently told CNN that he misspoke, meaning that Trump wanted him to be speaker.)Let's deal with this first: Yes, Trump could be speaker of the House. There is no requirement that the speaker be a member of Congress; the person simply has to get a majority of House members to support their bid for speaker.And there's no question that some in Trumpworld -- most notably Meadows -- don't love the idea of McCarthy becoming speaker of a new House Republican majority in 2023. Trump did offer praise for McCarthy on Friday for his marathon overnight speech on the House floor.To be clear: It would still be a massive long shot for Trump to wind up as speaker. There's a reason that the House has never picked someone outside of its ranks to serve as its leader.Plus, Trump quite clearly has designs on running for president in 2024 -- and it's hard to see how a pit stop as speaker of the House furthers that cause.Of course, because we are talking about Trump here, ruling any idea out -- no matter how wild and wacky -- is a fool's errand.The Point: There's enough unhappiness with McCarthy among the Trump wing of the party that this idea will keep coming up. Whether the former President actually pursues it is a different question.",0
7," (CNN)President Joe Biden underwent his annual physical Friday morning at Walter Reed Medical Center, his first such appointment since he was inaugurated as the oldest first-term president in US history.Afterward, his physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor wrote in a memo Biden ""remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.""The doctor, who has been with the President since he served as vice president, singled out two areas of ""observation"" he set aside for detailed investigation: an ""increasing frequency and severity of 'throat clearing' and coughing during speaking engagements"" and the President's ambulatory gait, or walking abnormality, which O'Connor said was ""perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago."" Both have been noticeable elements of Biden's public appearances since taking office. In a detailed, six-page summary of Biden's health, O'Connor said X-rays showed Biden has arthritis of his spine and normal wear and tear damage for someone of his age. The doctor characterized that damage as moderate to severe, but said it was not severe enough to warrant any specific treatment. He wrote it would help account for some of Biden's recent stiffness and clumsy gait. An ""extremely detailed neurologic exam"" was ""reassuring,"" O'Connor wrote, and showed no evidence of a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's.Biden also has a condition known as hiatal hernia, which causes him to have reflux -- something O'Connor said could account for his more frequent throat clearing.The document contained a detailed accounting of the physical exam, including his height of 5 feet 11.65 inches; his weight of 184 pounds; and his blood pressure of 120/70. Biden does not drink or use tobacco and works out five times a week, according to the report. ""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,"" O'Connor wrote in his summary.Biden received a routine colonoscopy Friday while at Walter Reed. The process, which required anesthesia, meant that he temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman to assume presidential power for 85 minutes Friday morning.As he left Walter Reed, Biden said he ""had a great physical and a great House of Representatives vote,"" alluding to the House passing his Build Back Better bill on Friday morning.The last extensive update on Biden's medical state came in December 2019, when the doctor he eventually recruited to serve as White House physician described him as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, hasn't released a full report on his health since.Biden is not behind in releasing medical information compared to his recent predecessors, who waited a full year before undergoing a physical and authorizing details to be released publicly.The latest update on Biden's health came after he, then-president-elect, fractured his foot in November while playing with his dog. In February, Biden's physician said the foot fractures ""are completely healed.""Presidents are not required to publicly disclose results of their annual check-ups but have done so to be transparent and assure the American people in the face of questions about their state of health. Presidents, however, have also hidden their illnesses, the severity of their illness, or medical treatments.Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009 and the White House physician, wrote the three-page medical summary Biden's presidential campaign released nearly two years ago. The 2019 summary showed Biden was being treated for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, or AFib -- an irregular heartbeat that O'Connor said Biden experiences no symptoms of. He was taking Crestor to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as Eliquis to prevent blood clots, Nexium for acid reflux, and Allegra and a nasal spray for seasonal allergies.The most significant medical event in Biden's history, O'Connor wrote, was when Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988. He was serving in the Senate at the time. During surgery, doctors found a second aneurysm that had not bled, which they also treated. While in the hospital after that surgery, Biden suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Doctors at the time inserted an ""inferior vena cava filter,"" which would prevent future blood clots from reaching the heart and lungs and treated him with an oral anti-coagulant for several months.Biden also had his gallbladder removed in 2003, and according to O'Connor he has had multiple surgeries and physical treatments for orthopedic injuries and sports medicine. Biden also has had several non-melanoma skin cancer lesions surgically removed. This story has been updated with additional information. ",0
8," (CNN)A new lawsuit has been filed on behalf of more than 280 Astroworld Festival concertgoers, the Thomas J. Henry Law firm announced in a news release Thursday. Ten people died as a result of the chaotic crowd surge at the Houston concert when headliner Travis Scott began performing on November 5.The suit, filed Wednesday, names defendants including Apple Music, Scott, the rapper Drake and Live Nation, alleging they were negligent and stood to make ""an exorbitant amount of money"" from the event but chose to ""cut corners, cut costs and put the festival attendees at risk.""""Many in the crowd were knocked to the ground and trampled, some were trapped and crushed against other concert attendees, while others were compressed against metal barricades,"" the lawsuit says. ""The resulting catastrophic incident and carnage were easily foreseeable and preventable had the Defendants acted in a reasonably prudent manner in planning a large-scale festival like Astroworld Fest.""CNN reached out to the defendants but did not immediately hear back. Scott said in a statement following the event he was ""devastated"" about what happened. He also pledged to cover all funeral costs for the victims. Live Nation previously said in a statement it was ""heartbroken for those lost and impacted"" and ""will continue working to provide as much information and assistance as possible to the local authorities as they investigate the situation."" Drake said in a statement posted on Instagram last week his ""heart is broken for the families and friends of those who lost their lives and for anyone who is suffering. I will continue to pray for all of them, and will be of service in any way I can.""The lawsuit seeks $2 billion in damages resulting from ""extreme pain and suffering, loss of earnings, emotional distress and medical expenses.""""My clients want to ensure the defendants are held responsible for their actions, and they want to send the message to all performers, event organizers, and promoters that what happened at Astroworld cannot happen again,"" attorney Thomas J. Henry said in a statement. At least 140 lawsuits have been filed in connection to the festival tragedy, according to Harris County District Court records.A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 125 plaintiffs earlier this week is seeking more than $750 million in damages to ""fix, help or make up for the harms and losses suffered"" by them. Among the plaintiffs is the family of Axel Acosta Avila, a 21-year-old college junior from Tieton, Washington, who died at the event.Witnesses described event as traumatizingHouston Fire Department Logs obtained by CNN last week show spectators at the event had already breached the main gate of the festival shortly after the 9 a.m. start time and that at least eight more breaches were reported throughout the day. Shortly before 5 p.m., Houston police reported ""dangerous crowd conditions"" at one stage.Minutes before Scott took the stage at 9 p.m., more than 260 people had already been treated, according to the logs. At 9:33 p.m., the police reported ""multiple people trampled, passed out at front stage."" A ""Level One MCI"" -- mass casualty incident -- was reported at 9:52 p.m., according to the logs.Between 10 p.m. to roughly 11:40 p.m., 17 people had been transported to hospitals, including at least six in cardiac arrests. Alex Pollak, the CEO of the medic company hired by the festival's organizers, said this week his staff had to treat 11 people with cardiac arrests at the same time. ""This is something I'll have nightmares about for the rest of my life,"" Pollak said. ""The team is extremely broken up about it. Seeing so many young people getting CPR at one time, it's just something no one should have to go through.""Witnesses described traumatizing conditions, some saying they saw lifeless bodies being trampled amid the chaos while others had to fight their way out of the crowd as the music continued.""It felt like it was the end for me,"" said attendee Selena Beltran, describing losing her balance as a crowd around her began jumping. ""To think that's how I'll die, I was so scared."" ""I did not know what to do. It was all happening so fast, but so slow and I couldn't react. I just screamed,"" Beltran added.It is unclear what Scott saw from the stage and whether he was aware of the crowd conditions, but he continued to perform until about 10:10 p.m. Scott's attorney said the artist did not know of the mass casualty declaration until the following morning.",0
9," (CNN)The NFL's Kansas City Chiefs have reached a financial agreement with the family of the 5-year-old girl who was seriously injured in a crash involving former assistant coach Britt Reid. According to a joint statement by the Chiefs and the family's attorneys, the team will provide the girl, Ariel Young, with ""world-class medical care and long-term financial stability"" for the ""rest of her life."" ""Over the last several months, representatives of the Kansas City Chiefs, Ariel Young and Ariel's family have worked together, alongside medical experts, to develop a plan to take care of Ariel — both now, and for the rest of her life,"" the statement said. ""The Chiefs and Ariel's attorney, Tom Porto, announce today that the parties have finalized a comprehensive care plan that provides Ariel with world-class medical care and long-term financial stability."" ""Ariel's recovery is a long road, but she has made great strides and continues to improve every day,"" it added. ""Earlier this fall, she attended her first day of school.""Ariel suffered a severe traumatic brain injury, a parietal fracture, brain contusions and subdural hematomas in the three-vehicle crash on February 4 when Kansas City, Missouri, police said a Chevrolet Impala was disabled on the ramp of Interstate 435. The driver had called family members for assistance, per police, and family members arrived and parked their vehicle south of the disabled car. A Dodge Ram truck allegedly driven by Reid struck both vehicles, sending two children, including Ariel, to the hospital. Reid was driving his truck at nearly 84 mph less than two seconds before the crash, per the Jackson County, Missouri, prosecutor's office, and a post-accident test showed his blood alcohol concentration to be at .113.Reid pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated in June. According to CNN affiliate KSHB, his trial date is set for April 18, 2022. The Chiefs initially placed Reid, the son of head coach Andy Reid, on administrative leave after the crash. The team did not sign him to a new contract following their loss in Super Bowl LV. ",0
10,"Jodhpur, India (CNN)The Child Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA) of 1929 set out to ""eradicate the evil of child marriage"" in India. Almost a century later, the south Asian nation remains home to a third of the world's child brides. As of 2017, 223 million girls and women who were married off before their 18th birthday lived in India, according to the United Nations agency, UNICEF. Only a fraction of the children entered into child marriages are boys. Between April 2019 and March 2020, Childline India received nearly nine times more complaints about the child marriage of girls than of boys.Not only did the CMRA not eradicate child marriage, the law also failed to provide a way out for those children who had already been forced into marriage.  So in 2007 the CMRA was repealed and replaced by the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), which recognized that child marriages were valid but voidable. Thanks to the PCMA, a victim of child marriage has up to two years after reaching adulthood to annul their union should they wish to -- or know to.  It is difficult to say how many young women have benefited from the annulment provision of the Act. There is not publicly available information and the Ministry of Women and Child Development has not responded to CNN's multiple requests for the number of child marriage annulments.  What is known is that at least 43 child marriages have been annulled. And what all of those stories have in common is tenacious child rights advocate named Kriti Bharti.  Married off at one  Bharti helped secure India's very first child marriage annulment and told CNN she has assisted in 42 other cases since discovering the annulment provision in the PCMA.In March 2012 she met 18-year-old Laxmi Sargara. Bharti, whose surname means ""India's daughter"" in Hindi, was 24 at the time and had just formally registered her organization, Saarthi Trust. Both women lived, and continue to live, in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, famous for its regal history and architecture, and in 2017 was home to 15 million women and girls who were married as children.Sargara had been one of them. She'd been married off at the age of one to a 3-year-old boy in a different village, but only learned of the union many years later when her in-laws came to tell her that in a few days' time she'd be moving in with them. In Rajasthan, it is not uncommon for children as young as one to be married in traditional ceremonies such as the mausar -- where a wedding takes place on the 12th day of mourning after the death of a family member. The child continues to live with their parents until their gauna -- the ritual where they are then sent to their in-laws' home after puberty. Frightened, Sargara told her parents she was going to visit her older brother in the city of Jodhpur, an hour away from their village. With his help, they reached out to Bharti, who was a social worker then with a reputation for helping child marriage victims delay their gauna. ""When Laxmi approached me, she wanted something permanent, and she didn't want a divorce for a marriage that she never consented to,"" Bharti recalls. ""After poring over hundreds of judgments and legal documents, we finally realized that there is a provision of annulment that she could use.""  ""We were using a law that no one had used before, that courts themselves did not know about,"" Bharti continues. ""Today when we file a case it's much easier but back then we were setting the precedent."" Confronting tradition Three years after that historic first annulment, Bharti met Santa Devi. Devi grew up in Rohicha Kallan, a village two hours from Jodhpur. People here are farmers or make handicrafts and furniture. After her uncle died, Devi was married in a mausar ceremony at just 11 months to a boy who was 10 at the time. Like Sargara, she would continue to be raised by her parents.  In 2010 at 15, Devi learned she was married to the 25-year-old man who she said had been following her everywhere she went and showing up outside her school for weeks. It was only when she told her father about him that she learned of her fate. ""This is what our elders have always done,"" Devi recalls him saying.  Devastated, Devi was desperate for a way out. Her search would lead her to Bharti who she calls ""didi"" -- older sister. ""Back then I couldn't speak up, I didn't even know Hindi, I had never even left my village. But when the groom's family pressured me to perform gauna, I knew I had to do something. We [Devi and a friend] looked everywhere for a solution and ultimately came across news articles of Kriti didi who nullifies child marriages,"" Devi explains.  After speaking with Devi's friend, Bharti agreed to help. They had to move quickly: Devi traveled to Jodhpur to meet Bharti and fill in the paperwork just six days before her 20th birthday, the cut-off age for annulment applications for Indian women.  Legally seeking to annul the marriage was one thing. Going up against rural institutions of power was quite another. When Devi told her father about her wish to have her marriage annulled, he met with Bharti and after being counselled by her, agreed to support his daughter. But when the village heard about what Devi had done, a meeting of the jati panchayat or caste council (made up of ""leading men of a group [who meet] to deal with the problems that affect the group"") was called and a fine of 16 lakh Rupees (about US$ 21,521) was imposed on Devi's father for breaking up a marriage. Once the jati panchayat was involved, and facing a fine and the prospect of expulsion from their village, Devi's father withdrew his support. Devi says he gave her an ultimatum: ""Rip the [annulment] papers, otherwise you are not my daughter"". ""My case was probably the worst one that didi has had to deal with...the jati panchayats gave us a lot of trouble. They threatened to kill me. If didi had not kept me with her they definitely would have killed me,"" Devi says.Caste panchayats, such as the one that fined Devi's father, act as parallel systems of law enforcement, imposing penalties ranging from fines to excommunication and even so-called honor killings, a euphemism for the brutal murders of women and girls, in contravention of the country's current laws.  ""Courts were established later, but jati panchayats have long existed so they take decisions as per tradition,"" says Bharti, explaining how these institutions preserve harmful cultural practices such as child marriage.  ""The law has not been an answer to the problem of child marriage,"" says Bharti Ali, founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights. ""[Child marriage] continues despite the law being there for a long time now"". A 2021 study (available only in Hindi) conducted by HAQ found that of 20 cases where child marriages were broken off, in seven instances the decision was made by jati panchayats. India's traditional divorce law was applied in three cases, but on only one occasion was the child marriage annulled. In all the other cases, agreements were reached between the families involved. Bharti explains that people turn to jati panchayats not knowing the difference between an annulment and a divorce and expecting divorces to be expensive, laborious processes. The caste council is also known on occasion to allow for child marriages to end but families never anticipate having to pay the fine known as the jhagda -- a Hindi word which literally translates as ""fight"".  ""The study clearly points out that decisions are taken by the panchayats. If we want these provisions of law [such as the PCMA] to be used we will have to figure out what are the local mechanisms and how can we link them to the courts,"" says Ali. But Bharti is less willing to work with these traditional institutions of power, arguing that women, perceived as having a lesser status in a patriarchal system and are therefore not allowed to attend the council meetings, do not get a fair hearing.  While she acknowledges that the legal framework isn't perfect, with the justice system often failing to treat child marriage victims as victims, she argues that the courts are still fairer. ""When you look at [formal] courts, although I agree that there is a lack of sensitivity, at least they hear both parties. Jati panchayats listen to the one who holds greater weight in society and they promote child marriage so we don't want to create a bridge with them,"" she says. What gives the panchayat power to make rulings as it does on child marriage is the fact that the customary practice remains ""largely acceptable"" as Ali puts it, in vast swathes of urban and rural India. ""Everyone belongs to a certain community. They carry a social identity with them so they first look at the interests of the community and then any other cause,"" she adds. Even Lakshman Jandu, a father who turned to Bharti for help with an annulment only after the jati panchayat asked him to pay a 15 lakh rupees (about $ 20,124) fine, admits that if his daughter's suitor had turned out to be ""a decent boy"" he would not have opposed the union. ""We didn't intend to get her married then but there was a lot of pressure from the community because the other family had another son that they wanted to marry off, so we said we'd get her married so long as their son completes his education,"" Jandu explains. ""But he got into a lot of bad habits, theft, breaking into people's houses, drinking...he was completely out of his parents' control,"" says the 54-year-old father who earns a living as a chauffeur. ""I don't see child marriage as bad but when the situation ends up like this then it is bad."" Jandu's experience confirms what Bharti has seen: that despite policymakers seeing the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act as ""the exit policy"" for all victims of a child marriage, their families -- whose support is often essential -- only use it if there is some other problem in the marriage, and not because a girl was married off as a child. ""In the beginning the parents are usually against it, they worry about what the jati panchayats and the community will say. So the first thing we do is counsel the parents,"" says Bharti.  'I want girls to speak up for themselves'Child marriage rates have been declining In India. In 1970, 74% of girls were married off before their 18th birthday and 42% before they turned 15. In 2015, those percentages had fallen to 27% and 7% respectively. The trend has been attributed to access to education, and ""public messaging around the illegality of child marriage"". Despite the decline there are still a lot of girls Bharti describes as forgotten.It is also true that in India marriage offers women security and status, so Bharti knows that the young women she works with are going to need equipping to navigate life on their own, or until they chose to remarry on their own terms. ""I tell all the girls that I will only take their case if they promise to continue their education,"" she says. ""I want them to get to a place where they are able to speak up for themselves and protest if they are ever pressured to get married again against their will.""  Devi, whose marriage was annulled in 2015, had to live with Bharti during the process of annulment and later at the shelter that Bharti runs. She says continuing with her education -- and Bharti's reputation -- gave her the confidence to eventually start going back to her village home.  ""I wanted to study and work like all girls dream of growing up and working, and I got to do exactly that,"" says Devi, who now works at an insurance company. ""Now I go home often, because I've made something of myself. Initially, people were scared if they heard about me visiting; they thought I would call didi. Young girls often come to me if they think a child marriage is going to take place and I give them didi's number."" Helping young women imagine a life for themselves after child marriage and then supporting them as they build that life has been rewarding for Bharti but it has also been risky. ""I may not get breakfast, lunch or dinner on some days, but I definitely receive threats on a daily basis,"" says Bharti, who lives with her mother. ""I have also had instances of receiving fake tips about a child marriage taking place in attempts to lure me to a certain location. Call it a gut feeling or intuition, luckily I've avoided the worst,"" she adds. When asked if she has been to the police to report any of the threats she receives, Bharti says doing so would only make it harder for her to interact with the people she is trying to help because it would alienate her from them.   She knows the risks she is taking to help girls use a little-known law to fight a long-held tradition, yet she does it anyway. ""[The law had previously forgotten] about girls once they are married off, but they are the ones who need our help the most... No one is immortal, so if I can help even 10 girls along the way, I'm happy to take the risk.""  Read more from the As Equals series ",0
11," (CNN)When a neighbor went to check on 70-year-old James Fitzgerald on November 6, they found a decomposing body inside the home Fitzgerald had lived in for the last 15 years in the town of Seneca, about an hour outside of Greenville, South Carolina.Police used autopsy results and fingerprints to positively identify the dead man, and it turns out his name, in fact, was not James Fitzgerald.And he was no ordinary neighbor.Authorities identified the body as belonging to Frederick McLean, a fugitive on the FBI's 15 Most Wanted Fugitive list, the US Marshals Service announced in a news release on Friday. Mclean had been on the run for 16 years. He was wanted by the San Diego Sheriff's Department in California on multiple counts of sexual assault on a child and was deemed at high risk for sexually assaulting young girls. One alleged victim, now an adult, reported McLean assaulted her more than 100 times, starting when she was 5 years old and ending about seven years later. An arrest warrant was issued for him in 2005 and he was added to the fugitive list in 2006. ""The discovery of Frederick McLean's body marks an end to the manhunt, but the investigation continues,"" said US Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis in the releaseMarshals and local authorities continue their investigation to see if McLean had any help to avoid the law.",0
12,"New York (CNN Business)The Marriott hotel in Prague refused to host a conference this month aimed at drawing attention to alleged human rights abuses in China, the hotel chain confirmed to CNN on Friday.The Prague Marriott cited ""reasons of political neutrality"" for its decision to decline to host the World Uyghur Congress, according to an email first reported by Axios. In a statement, Marriott International (MAR), Inc. said the Prague hotel's response to the group was ""not consistent with our policies."" Marriott said the Prague hotel's management team has reached out to the group to apologize.""We are working with the hotel team to provide additional training and education on our longstanding practices of inclusion,"" Marriott said.Marriott confirmed that last month, the Prague Marriott sent an email to the activist group explaining that the planned November conference would not be held at the location -- after consulting with corporate management. ""Unfortunately, I have to inform you that we are not able to offer the premises. We consulted the whole matter with our corporate management. For reasons of political neutrality, we cannot offer events of this type with a political theme,"" the email said. Marriott International told CNN this was a ""hotel-level decision"" and the reference to ""corporate management"" refers to the management of the Prague hotel. Activists find Marriott's response ""chilling.""Based in Germany, the World Uyghur Congress is made up of exiled Uyghurs and those seeking to draw attention to allegations of genocide in the Xinjiang region of China. An independent report by more than 50 global experts released in March found the Chinese government ""bears state responsibility for an ongoing genocide against the Uyghur"" in violation of the United Nations' Genocide Convention. Chinese state media has called the World Uyghur Congress a terrorist group. China has also denied human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet and has called the allegations of genocide ""preposterous.""Zumretay Arkin, a program and advocacy manager for the World Uyghur Congress, confirmed that Marriott did reach out to the group's representative in Prague. ""But I'm still waiting for an official apology,"" Arkin said on Twitter. In an interview with Axios, Arkin said Marriott's response was ""shocking.""""We organize international events all the time and this is the first time we were given this excuse,"" Arkin told Axios. ""It is chilling because of the broader concept of how China is really disrupting Western democracies.""In its statement to CNN, Marriott said it is committed to ""giving a warm welcome to all.""""We are in the hospitality business, welcoming people from all around the world and from all walks of life representing many beliefs,"" the company said. The incident is the latest misstep for Marriott involving China, a major and fast-growing market for the hotel chain. In 2018, Chinese authorities blocked the Marriott website and app after the company listed Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as separate ""countries"" in its emails and app. Marriott apologized profusely and insisted it respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.",0

14," (CNN)The FBI conducted another search for the remains of one-time Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa last month, this time under a bridge in Jersey City, New Jersey, a source with knowledge of the search told CNN.The FBI obtained a search warrant to conduct a ""site survey"" under the Pulaski Skyway, FBI Special Agent Mara Schneider of the Detroit field office said in a statement Friday. ""On October 25th & 26th, FBI personnel from the Newark and Detroit field offices completed the survey and that data is currently being analyzed,"" Schneider said. ""Because the affidavit in support of the search warrant was sealed by the court, we are unable to provide any additional information.""The FBI used radar equipment to conduct the two-day subterranean search on private property, the source told CNN.Hoffa's presumed death has vexed investigators for decades. He was 62 years old when he was last seen outside the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan on July 30, 1975.One of the most powerful union leaders at a time that unions wielded a great deal of sway over elections -- and were notoriously tied to organized crime -- Hoffa was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud.President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980. But Hoffa tried to regain control of the union, angering his rivals.The FBI has searched various locations in their effort to locate Hoffa's remains but have always come up empty-handed. Hoffa, played by Al Pacino, was a main character in the 2019 Martin Scorsese film ""The Irishman.""The movie was adapted from the book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran, who claimed he shot and killed Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003.",0
15," (CNN)A key federal defendant accused of conspiracy over the 2017 Unite the Right rally was forced this week to confront his own explicit calls for violence -- and who should do the actual fighting -- in the months before the deadly event unfolded in Charlottesville, Virginia.Christopher Cantwell is among 25 defendants being sued for his role in the gathering that brought together far-right groups and racists for a weekend the main organizer had privately billed as ""The Battle of Charlottesville."" Cantwell, who's known as the ""crying Nazi,"" has tried to make the case that the threat that weekend from counterprotesters, including far-left antifa activists who track White nationalists online and try to disrupt their rallies, justified the White nationalists' acts of violence.But on the stand, Cantwell had to listen to recordings of his own podcast, including one from January 2017 -- some eight months before the deadly Charlottesville rally -- in which he discussed Dylann Roof, who in 2015 murdered nine people at a Black church in South Carolina.Roof ""had no future"" and so was ""exactly the kind of person who should be committing acts of mass murder,"" said Cantwell's guest, a guy from the neo-Nazi gossip blog The Daily Stormer. Cantwell agreed: ""Not everyone's going to be a professional propagandist, shall we say. Some of us got to be fucking cannon fodder for the race war.""Plaintiffs in the Charlottesville suit argue the chaos that erupted there was intentional and planned by the defendants in a conspiracy to commit racially motivated violence. They have presented thousands of pages of evidence -- private messages, podcasts, chat logs, even an ex-girlfriend's testimony -- detailing how the alt-right anticipated violence and how they approached the critical issue of who among them could be counted on to enact it.What has become clear over three weeks of trial is that, for all their talk of brotherhood and unifying the White race, some in the White power movement expected others to carry out violence for the sake of their cause and considered those people disposable.It is perhaps not surprising that a movement that dehumanizes large groups of people would treat its own members with casual cruelty. Still, it's one reason they're turning on each other with spectacular bitterness in court.'Optics': Friendlier packaging of White supremacySo, who exactly was to be that ""cannon fodder?"" The Charlottesville organizers have long said they didn't know James Alex Fields, who murdered Heather Heyer with his car in the chaos after the Unite the Right rally, and that the violence wasn't their fault. But their private communications unearthed by the plaintiffs reveal the White nationalists apparently anticipated violence in Charlottesville, even as they framed it among themselves as ""self-defense.""The White power movement has long been divided by class, a phenomenon its members call ""boots vs suits."" By 2015, it was also divided along generational lines, which White nationalists referred to as ""White Nationalism 1.0"" versus ""White Nationalism 2.0."" The 1.0 version -- associated with the Ku Klux Klan, skinheads, poor White Southerners and those less educated and with less internet illiteracy -- was being pushed aside by the alt-right, which wanted to look younger, wealthier and better educated. ""White Nationalism 1.0 was a sausage fest,"" one teenage fascist told me in 2016, using slang for a party that doesn't have enough women. He said he aimed to change that. (He has not.)Within White power, this debate is referred to as ""optics."" The racist beliefs are largely the same, though the alt-right's misogyny has stunned old-school neo-Nazis, they've told me.Alt-right advocates have said -- in interviews, private messages and public memes -- they thought they could win over more people by looking clean cut and friendly and by saying racist stuff with ironic detachment, compared to skinheads, whose lack of subtlety they thought turned off the general public.But as the evidence unfolding in the Charlottesville federal case -- Sines v. Kessler -- shows, behind the scenes, the new alt-right had the same affinity for violence: They might have wanted to look classier, but the point was the same.In May 2017, in his first messages about Unite the Right, its main organizer, Jason Kessler, referred in a group chat to a huge brawl a month earlier between alt-right groups and antifascists, writing: ""I think we need to have a battle of Berkeley situation in Charlottesville."" During that scrum, Nathan Damigo, now also a defendant in the Charlottesville case, was caught on video punching a woman in the face. Damigo had founded Identity Evropa, which members told me was intended to look like a preppy, aspirational, White nationalist fraternity. Video of the punch became an alt-right meme, and it brought a surge in applications to Identity Evropa, or IE, according to conversations among members presented at the Charlottesville trial by plaintiffs, who are funded by the non-profit Integrity First for America.This is what Kessler wanted to drum up, but with more groups -- or, as he said in one a group chat for planning alt-right events, to ""assemble every motherfucker you can."" Kessler wanted to bring together Damigo, Richard Spencer, the Proud Boys and a guy known as Based Stickman for beating people with a stick at a rally, and ""fight this shit out,"" according to messages he affirmed at trial were his.He wanted the Charlottesville event ""PUBLICIZED"" so that antifa would show up. ""They bring everything they've got and we do too,"" Kessler said in the same chat. In fact, Kessler was deeply invested in getting antifa to show up and fight the alt-right. He urged one White power group not to wear guns because it would be too much of a deterrent. ""If you want a chance to crack some Antifa skulls in self-defense, don't open carry. You will scare the shit out of them and they'll just stand off to the side,"" Kessler said in a June 2017 Charlottesville planning group chat presented at trial.He advised more subtle weapons: ""I recommend you bring picket signposts, shields and other self-defense implements which can be turned from a free speech tool to a self-defense weapon should things turn ugly.""Again, in the same group chat, Kessler returned to optics: ""Please do not open carry. We want to avoid that optic for both the media and Antifa. We ultimately don't want to scare them from laying hands on us if they can't stand our peaceful demonstration.""""The alt-right is a dangerous movement. It feeds on the chaos energy of our unchecked racism bantz,"" Kessler said in a chatroom in May 2017, closing with the slang for ironic online banter. ""But in IRL (in real life) activism ... you have to be more like a civil rights movement for whites."" Kessler continued to say he was happy to fight without the jokes ""to secure a future for my people."" He added: ""This is war.""When encouraging other White nationalists to post public messages that would goad antifa into fighting them, Kessler said in July in the Charlottesville planning group chat, ""I want to talk shit but as the event organizer I can only do so much. People need to bullycide them into confronting the alt-right in Charlottesville.'We can't depend on anyone outside ... the hard right'Kessler acknowledged during the trial that he delegated some Unite the Right planning to Matthew Heimbach, who led the Traditionalist Worker Party, a White power group that advertised itself as working-class. Heimbach is now a codefendant. Kessler asked Heimbach to reach out to two skinhead gangs, the Hammerskins and Blood & Honour Social Club, Heimbach testified. Plaintiffs' attorney Karen Dunn repeatedly asked Heimbach if he invited those groups because they were known for violence; he claimed it was to deter violence.Heimbach testified that anti-fascist counterprotesters would be intimidated by the skinheads, that they ""would be less likely to want to assault members of the Hammerskins than college students in white polos."" That was a reference to the white polos worn by members of Identity Evropa, whose collared-and-khaki uniform became infamous after Charlottesville.Heimbach testified that he invited other groups to Unite the Right that were also more explicitly extreme or known for street fights, like the National Socialist Movement, whose members have been known to wear swastika armbands and brownshirt uniforms. The group is familiar with violence: In 2006, a member insulted another White power group at a Klan concert, sparking a brawl in which five National Socialist Movement members were beaten by almost 50 skinheads, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported; its 2009 anti-immigration demonstration in Riverside, California, caused a brawl.Heimbach also said he invited Vanguard America, a fascist group. In July 2017, Heimbach texted Vanguard America's leader about the National Front, or NF -- an umbrella group that included his own Traditionalist Worker Party, Vanguard America, National Socialist Movement and the League of the South -- saying, ""We need plans. The NF has been charged with taking the ground early, so I need to talk to you and get our security leaders talking to one another."" At trial, Dunn asked Heimbach about a July 2017 private message exchange between him and a person he testified was Vanguard America's ""security representative for Charlottesville."" Less than a month ahead of the rally, they were anticipating counterprotesters would block their access to the event site, Emancipation Park, and that only the more explicitly extreme ""hard right"" groups could secure the site for Unite the Right.Heimbach: ""It's really up to us. If we don't take the park, it's over before it began.""Vanguard representative: ""Exactly. And we can't depend on anyone outside of, as Ike (Baker, of League of the South) described it, the hard right. I'm trying to get an official stance from IE right now. If they won't assist, I want it on record.""Dunn asked what that meant. ""Identity Evropa and the Traditionalist Worker Party and other organizations had a fraught relationship that was also very much at odds with one another due to subcultural and class differences,"" Heimbach said. But did it mean ""the hard right could be relied upon to be more violent or aggressive?"" Dunn asked.Heimbach again reframed it as a question of self-defense: ""I would say the discipline and organization of groups such as myself were more reliable to ensure that there wouldn't be violence. We were used to, unfortunately, being attacked by anti-fascists at demonstrations."" Dunn asked again -- ""yes or no"" -- did it have something to do with violence? ""Self-defense, yes,"" Heimbach said. Dunn: And you didn't think IE would be willing to do that? Heimbach: No, they were more the boat shoes, bougie types.Black clothes hide bloodWhat the White nationalists wore -- and what those outfits communicated -- were clearly important.In May 2017, Kessler texted Heimbach that he was concerned that a KKK rally planned for that July in Charlottesville ""will hurt the overall pro white message,"" and wondered if they could be convinced to come to Charlottesville ""in plain clothes,"" just as he'd asked the National Socialist Movement to do. Whatever his class differences with Identity Evropa, Heimbach indicated he saw the value in the optics-friendly preppy look. ""Let's set the dress code now, khakis and a polo,"" he texted.But Heimbach's group was required to wear ""head-to-toe black,"" according to a detailed email sent to Traditionalist Worker Party members about uniform requirements for Charlottesville. When asked why those members wore black Dickies-brand work clothes, Heimbach testified, ""because we are a working-class party, and that's typical working-class attire for factory workers across America."" Dunn then read from Heimbach's August 2020 deposition:Question: Isn't it true that one of the reasons that you believed your members should wear all black is because black is a good color to hide blood?Heimbach: Yes. If someone is injured, it isn't a good look if they're bleeding all over a white polo shirt.Heimbach has repeatedly expressed frustration at his perception that alt-right leaders like Spencer and Identity Evropa were classist, complaining to me once that when the Traditionalist Worker Party did security at one of Spencer's events in 2018 and its members got injured, Heimbach asked Spencer for some money to get his guys some health care. Heimbach said Spencer hung up the phone. I've asked Spencer about this, and he didn't deny it. After this rally, Spencer quit speaking at colleges, saying, ""Antifa is winning."" At the Unite the Right trial, a lawyer for Kessler and Identity Evropa, James Kolenich, asked Heimbach if he considered them to be ""hard right."" Heimbach said no. ""Would your organization have relied on Identity Evropa or Kessler for physical defense at a public event?"" He said no.A few days before Unite the Right, the rally had lost its permit. Organizers planned to go to the same park anyway, according to testimony and interviews with CNN. In considering this tactic, Cantwell confirmed at trial that he texted Spencer, ""I'm willing to risk a lot for our cause, including violence and incarceration, but I want to coordinate to make sure it's worth it for our cause."" Spencer responded, ""It's worth it. At least to me.""But Spencer did not do any of the fist-fighting. Before Charlottesville, Spencer was the most prominent figure associated with the alt-right, but he'd spent much of the previous years publishing books on scientific racism and going to conferences of older racist professors and lawyers like Kevin MacDonald and Sam Dickson. Once the alt-right wave began to swell in 2015, Spencer became the subject of both fascination and ridicule within the movement for wearing fancy suits and speaking in a fancy way. Spencer, who is representing himself at the Charlottesville trial, asked Heimbach what he'd thought of him back in 2017. Heimbach answered, ""Kind of always viewed you as a bit of a dandy.""Spencer asked, ""There was a discussion during your testimony ... about relying on people at this rally. Could you rely on me?"" Heimbach said no. ",0

17,"London (CNN)Here in the UK, a deep-seated debate on privacy is taking place after the Guardian newspaper announced it was taking legal action over the media's exclusion from a hearing on Prince Philip's will earlier this year.A version of this story appeared in the November 19 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here. In September, Andrew McFarlane, president of the High Court's Family Division, ruled that Philip's will would be sealed for 90 years. Among the few present was a lawyer representing the duke's estate from law firm Farrer & Co, the Queen's private solicitors, and the attorney general, the government's chief legal adviser. The media weren't told of the hearing or permitted to attend, with the public interest represented by the attorney general.A Guardian News & Media spokesperson told CNN in an emailed statement that the High Court's decision to ban the media from the court hearing without informing outlets or allowing them to make representations ""is a clear threat to the principles of open justice.""""It is also concerning that the court appears to believe that only the attorney general can speak to the public interest,"" the spokesperson continued. ""We are seeking permission to argue that the behaviour of the high court in this instance constitutes a failure of open justice and that the case should be reheard.""According to British law, if a person prepares a will prior to their death, it becomes a public document after being admitted to probate, and anyone can obtain a copy from the Probate Registry for a fee.  However, anyone can ask the court to ""seal"" a will and keep it private, according to Geoff Kertesz and Judith Swinhoe-Standen from UK law firm Stewarts. ""The court must be persuaded that it would be 'undesirable or otherwise inappropriate' to make the will public,"" they told CNN. ""Historically, the courts have approved such applications only for senior members of the royal family. It is unclear under what, if any, other circumstances the court might agree to keep a will private.""One recent senior royal whose will was made public was Diana, Princess of Wales, who gave up her HRH title when she divorced Prince Charles.Judge McFarlane said in his ruling that ""it has become the convention that, following the death of a senior member of the Royal Family, an application to seal their will is made"" and that ""it appears that such applications have always been heard in private and have invariably been granted.""He said it was understood that the first member of the royal family whose will was sealed was Prince Francis of Teck, the younger brother of King George V's wife Queen Mary, who died in 1910.Legal and royal expert Michael L. Nash told CNN: ""It was Queen Mary who used these unusual royal powers and prerogatives never used before.""Francis died suddenly at the age of 40, following a botched medical examination of his nose, according to Nash, who also authored ""Royal Wills in Britain from 1509 to 2008."" He said the prince was a ""reckless gambler"" but also an ""extremely lovable character,"" who bequeathed treasured family jewels to his mistress in a draft version of his will.Nash, who has seen a copy of the draft will that surfaced in archives in Northern Ireland, said the prince was constantly in financial trouble, and upon his death ""Queen Mary knew that the creditors, once they saw the will, would descend and everything that Frank died possessed of would have to be sold in order to satisfy these massive debts.""He continued, ""And she was absolutely mortified that the public would be able to know about the state that her brother had got himself into.""Nash also pointed out that the family has faced legal challenges to the secrecy of royal wills before, the most recent of which was considered by the court in 2007. He highlighted an application by Robert Andrew Brown, who claimed to be the illegitimate child of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret. Brown sought to open Margaret's will, as well as that of the Queen Mother, but the claim was dismissed as a fantasy, Nash said. Privacy has become the debate of the modern era for the British monarchy, with the question of how much privacy a family member deserves routinely emerging. Critics often say royals use their positions and privilege to secure exemptions and evade scandal, while also noting that the Windsors are funded by taxpayers.In his judgment, McFarlane said he was the custodian of a safe holding more than 30 envelopes, each of which supposedly contains the secret will of a dead royal. The most recent additions were made in 2002 with those of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.  McFarlane also touched upon why privacy was afforded for royal wills, saying: ""The answer to the question 'why should there be an exception for senior members of the Royal Family?' is, in my view, clear: it is necessary to enhance the protection afforded to the private lives of this unique group of individuals, in order to protect the dignity and standing of the public role of the Sovereign and other close members of Her family.""Lawyers Kertesz and Swinhoe-Standen said there was a notable difference in the handling of the Duke of Edinburgh's wills and those of royals before him.""All previously sealed royal wills are to be kept private indefinitely, but Prince Philip's will is different in that its privacy is time-restricted to 90 years,"" the pair said. ""After 90 years, certain officials may inspect it, and they may then invite the court to rule on whether the will should be made public at that point, or kept private for a further period.""Nash described the time limit as an ""important advance,"" as the previous position meant wills were concealed in perpetuity. ""That gave serious misgivings to historians, lawyers, researchers -- everybody that had a valid reason for reading the will,"" he added.""I can see in future cases that 90 years tumbling down to, say, 50 years or even less. So that there is at least some possibility of people living now being able to read (a will) at some time in the future during their lifetime.""HAVE YOUR SAYSo, what do you think: Should or shouldn't the public be allowed to read a royal will, and why?It's certainly an interesting one to ponder.

18," (CNN)""From early on there was a lot of, 'You lot sit over there near the toilets,' the word 'P***' was used constantly, no one ever stamped it out,"" said former cricketer Azeem Rafiq as he laid bare this week his experience of racial abuse at one of England's top clubs.  November 16, 2021 may come to be remembered as cricket's day of reckoning; in the aftermath of Rafiq's testimony, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) -- the sport's regulator in those two countries -- spoke of taking the ""necessary action"" and the need to ""learn lessons as a game."" The ECB has quite a job on its hands.Rafiq's detailed account of his time at Yorkshire County Cricket Club hardly shocked Taj Butt, who worked for the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation, the club's charity and community arm, between 2014 and 2017.""As depressing as it was listening to him ... some of the things he faced didn't come as a surprise to most people involved in the game, whether it's at a grassroots level or at the highest level,"" Butt tells CNN Sport. ""These are the sort of things that unfortunately do still happen on an everyday basis."" During his testimony to UK lawmakers on Tuesday, Rafiq detailed some of the appalling behavior he was subjected to while playing for Yorkshire, adding that he believes he lost his cricket career to racism. In an interview with CNN, Rafiq also said he would stop his children from getting into cricket as he doesn't want his ""son or daughter to be in pain."" The hours-long testimony was the culmination of a 16-month period, during which Yorkshire undertook an independent review into more than 40 allegations of racism and bullying made by Rafiq.  Following the review, the club accepted that Rafiq had been the ""victim of inappropriate behavior"" at Yorkshire, although no one at the club was disciplined as a result of the independent investigation.   On Tuesday, former Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton, who resigned from his role amid the handling of Rafiq's allegations, said the club is institutionally racist. Hutton said that the ECB ""declined to help"" when he approached the governing body after learning of Rafiq's allegations.For Butt, who has been involved in the sport in the Yorkshire area for much of his life, the lack of accountability in response to Rafiq's allegations has been stark. ""The institution has been quite arrogant about the fact that they felt they could actually get away without having to do anything,"" he says. ""That's actually shown in the way they've dealt with Azeem Rafiq and the whole situation. We certainly hope that the first thing they do is recognize that there is a problem.  ""That's one thing they have never done, they've never seen it as a problem ... But I think they're still at that denial stage."" CNN has contacted Yorkshire for a response to Butt's comments. On Thursday, Rafiq apologized for anti-Semitic comments he said he made in 2011 following the emergence of a screenshot of messages. ""I am incredibly angry at myself and I apologise to the Jewish community and everyone who is rightly offended by this,"" Rafiq said.In response to the apology, Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""Azeem Rafiq has suffered terribly at the hands of racists in cricket so he will well understand the hurt this exchange will cause to Jews who have supported him.  ""His apology certainly seems heartfelt and we have no reason to believe he is not completely sincere."" Kamlesh Patel, who recently took over from Hutton as chair of Yorkshire, has vowed that the club will change. ""There is no quick fix to the clear problems which have been identified, and the issues are complex, not least the charge of institutional racism which must be addressed head on,"" he said in a statement. ""Azeem noted that this is not about individuals, but rather the structure and processes of the Club, and we need to tackle this.  ""It is clear that we have good people at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and that gives me hope that we can."" 'Glass ceiling'  While Rafiq's testimony has made headlines this week, Butt says the Yorkshire region has been mistreating South Asian cricketers for decades, even at a grassroots level.  He currently serves as chair of the Quaid-e-Azam Sunday Cricket League (QeASCL), which was formed in 1980 in an attempt to create more opportunities for Asian cricketers in Yorkshire and its surrounding areas. ""For a young Asian person to go and join the local club, that was simply a no-go area for them,"" Butt explains of the reasons behind the league's formation.  He adds: ""In the sport of cricket, there is a great divide if you happen to be from the South Asian community and from an inner-city area and don't go to a [fee-paying] public school. ""You are going to face a great disadvantage in participation in the sport of cricket because your access to facilities, grounds and all the other things that go on to make things more accessible unfortunately is lacking."" Over the years, a handful of players who starred for teams in the QeASCL have gone on to play professional cricket, including Yorkshire and England's Adil Rashid. Yorkshire is home to a large South Asian population, but the county side only lifted its rule of selecting Yorkshire-born players in 1992.""We've always known for our young people to progress, they're going to have to be twice as good as their White counterparts in order to develop further,"" says Butt. ""Clearly, once they get into the system and the higher up they go ... there seem to be barriers, there still seems to be that glass ceiling. And clearly, young people are still being discriminated against."" Pathway restrictions are not just unique to Yorkshire. According to the ECB, South Asian communities account for 30% of all cricket players in England and Wales, but just 4% of first class county cricketers are of South Asian origin.  The ECB operates a South Asian Action Plan to create more opportunities for -- and to better engage with -- South Asian communities. 'Significant moment for change' The week before Rafiq's testimony in UK Parliament, during which he described cricket's racism problem as ""worse than society,"" those with experience of discrimination in the sport have been urged to submit their perceptions and experiences to the Independent Commission for Equity on Cricket (ICEC). Cindy Butts, chair of the ICEC, told the BBC that more than 1,000 people came forward to share their experiences in the week after the call for evidence was made. ""In years to come, we will see this as a significant moment for change in cricket and society,"" former England cricketer Monty Panesar told CNN this week. ""Azeem Rafiq should be applauded for his brave comments. He's willing to work with the ECB and Yorkshire County Cricket Club to address some of the issues in our game."" ",0
19," (CNN Business)Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder and former CEO of Theranos, is taking the stand in her own criminal trial.Holmes began testimony on Friday afternoon in the San Jose courtroom during the first day of the defense's case. She is also expected to testify on Monday and Tuesday next week, the only days court is in session.Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces 11 federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each charge.Whether Holmes would testify was a big question looming over the trial. She has attended the trial each day, typically with her mother and occasionally her partner. On Friday, her partner, mother and at least one person who appeared to be her friend were in attendance. She was smiling as she took the stand and during much of her testimony.Off the bat, Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey asked her if she believed Theranos had developed technology that was capable of running any blood test. ""I did,"" Holmes testified. ""We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all the technologies in a laboratory. The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples and run that formula,"" Holmes testified, adding that by 2009 or 2010, the company had a ""breakthrough."" Downey then stepped backed to establish the background of the company's origin, including how she was a chemical engineering student at Stanford University and her first patent application.""I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money that they had saved for me to be able to go to college to work on my patent,"" she testified. ""Then I went to try to raise or borrow money.""""Were you able to?"" her attorney asked.""I was,"" she replied.The original patent was not for blood testing. Rather, she started with the idea of a pill that could be swallowed without any other actions needed, she said.Holmes went on to explain the evolution of her idea from a pill to a patch to a benchtop device. ""As I started talking to people about what could be useful for a pharmaceutical clinical trial, I learned people were interested in a benchtop or a tabletop device and we moved to trying to build that,"" she said.She testified that she then built out a prototype and set out to raise financing to develop it into a product. She testified she was introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas ""by someone who had gone to college with my dad."" ""I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long-term,"" she testified, adding that he did a ""very comprehensive diligence process.""Holmes said that process included ""giving him a lot of information about our patents."" ""He asked us to get an audit of our financials,"" she testified. ""He wanted copies of contracts and other information about the business. He wanted to speak to people that we were talking to and interacting with.""He ultimately invested and served as Theranos' chairman of the board for a number of years.Holmes' attorneys previously indicated in court documents that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. They indicated that she is ""likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed, relied on, and deferred to Mr. Balwani,"" who is nearly 20 years her senior. The filings were from 2020 and unsealed just before the trial kicked off with jury selection in late August. Balwani, according to a court filing from his attorneys, ""adamantly denies"" the claims.Her attorneys also indicated plans to have an expert testify about the psychological, emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of Balwani.A Stanford University dropout, Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 with the mission to revolutionize blood testing. Inspired by her stated fear of needles, the company promised patients the ability to test for conditions such as cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos had struck up partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway, and a who's who list of board members and investors. Then it all came crashing down. A damning investigation by The Wall Street Journal in October 2015 called into question the capabilities of the company's proprietary blood testing machine, Edison, as well as Theranos' testing methods. Theranos was subsequently sued by investors for fraud and had its US blood-testing license revoked. The firm settled ""massive fraud"" charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately dissolved in September 2018.",0
20," (CNN)Suspended South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh has been indicted on more than two dozen new financial crimes by a state grand jury, which alleged schemes to ""defraud victims of and thereafter launder"" nearly $5 million in five different counties.South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson's office announced Friday a state grand jury issued five indictments with a total of 27 charges against Murdaugh.The indictments include four counts of Breach of Trust with Fraudulent Intent; seven counts of Obtaining Signature or Property by False Pretenses; seven counts of Money Laundering; eight counts of Computer Crimes; and one count of Forgery.The majority of the indictments center on cases and victims not previously known to the public, like a highway patrolman injured in the line of duty, from whom prosecutors allege Murdaugh stole settlement money for ""his own personal use, for expenses including but not limited to overdraft fees, cash, and checks written to associates.""""Altogether, Murdaugh is charged with respect to alleged schemes to defraud victims and thereafter launder $4,853,488.09,"" said the Attorney General's office in a release Friday.According to the indictments, state attorneys alleged Murdaugh defrauded and laundered $792,000 in Bamberg County, $125,000 in Orangeburg County, $70,000 in Colleton County, $383,056.14 in Allendale County and $3,483,431.95 in Beaufort County. The multi-million-dollar sum in Beaufort County is related to the previously reported wrongful death settlement with the family of the Murdaugh family's housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield. Murdaugh is currently being held without bond in a Columbia, S.C. jail on two earlier charges of obtaining property by false pretenses related to the Satterfield family wrongful death settlement. In a statement sent to CNN, the attorneys for the Satterfield family addressed the new indictments, saying, in part, ""The Satterfield family is grateful to law enforcement for their continued efforts in the investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Gloria Satterfield and the egregious breaches of trust and theft committed upon her sons. The additional indictments brought today in connection with the crimes committed against Gloria and her sons as well as apparently others are welcome, long overdue and were appropriately brought.""Attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Ritcher continued in the statement, ""Of course, Mr. Murdaugh is entitled to his presumption of innocence and to his rights under the criminal process.  For now, however, it seems the statewide grand jury was as unimpressed with his opioid defense and other explanations given as we have been.  As always, we are steadfastly in the Satterfield corner and committed to seeing these matters to the end.  Ultimately, we will entrust a judge or jury to let us know when the Satterfields have received their full cup of justice -- not Alex Murdaugh or his attorneys.""CNN has reached out to Murdaugh's attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, for comment but has not received a response.He is also facing several lawsuits in civil court, including one from his former firm.Murdaugh, a once prominent South Carolina attorney, was shot in the head on a roadway September 4, but survived. He later admitted to authorities he conspired with former client Curtis Smith to kill him as part of a fraud scheme so his only surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance payout.Murdaugh has since been charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false police report.The shooting followed the June deaths of Murdaugh's wife, Margaret, and son, Paul, who were fatally shot outside their home in Islandton, South Carolina. The case remains unsolved. Murdaugh has denied responsibility in the killings.",0
21," (CNN)Former NFL player Zac Stacy is in police custody after disturbing video surfaced appearing to show Stacy assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Orlando Police took Stacy into custody after an arrest warrant was issued out of Oakland, Florida, on Wednesday. Stacy was arrested Thursday night at Orlando International Airport as he exited an inbound flight from Nashville, Orlando Police spokeswoman Heidi Rodriguez said in a statement. According to the arrest warrant, police responded to a home in Oakland, Florida, on November 13 in response to a domestic disturbance. When officers arrived, they found the victim who appeared to be ""emotionally distraught"" wearing a torn shirt with food in her hair, the warrant stated. Police also stated in the warrant that they observed a television that had been knocked over after the perpetrator threw the victim into it.Graphic video from the incident shows a man, who police have identified as Stacy, striking the woman multiple times then picking her up and tossing her into a television, causing it to fall on top of her. The woman is heard on the video pleading with Stacy to stop. Stacy is also seen violently throwing the victim into a baby walker on the ground before he walks out of the home.  Kristin Evans, who identifies herself as the victim in the video and Stacy's ex-girlfriend, posted the video to her Instagram account. In a statement to CNN, Evans says, ""Thank you for supporting my children and me during this difficult time. Our safety is the number one concern right now. After a terrifying experience, I am grateful that Zac Stacy is currently in police custody. At present, I have filed a restraining order and plan on filing a civil complaint. I am sincerely asking the NFL and football commissioner Roger Goodell to confront the reality that players are experiencing PTSD from their time playing pro-football. In particular, as linked to repeated concussions, brain injury, and other bodily trauma, as it causes symptomatic changes to the players' character, including increased irritability, angry outbursts, and aggressive behavior​.""According to the warrant, two children, including a child that Stacy shares with the victim, were both inside the home at the time of the incident. Stacy is currently being held in the Orange County Jail on aggravated battery and criminal mischief charges.During a first court appearance on Friday, a judge set bond at $10,150 and ordered Stacy to have no contact with the victim and to surrender his passport and firearms, according to CNN affiliate WESH. CNN has reached out to Stacy's attorney for comment. ",0
22," (CNN)Four teenagers are facing ethnic intimidation charges for an attack involving a group of Asian students on a Philadelphia train this week, said Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner. Three male students and a female student were traveling on a train Wednesday from Olney, a neighborhood in North Philadelphia, when they were attacked by four Black girls, said Thomas Nestel, police chief for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA).In a press conference, Nestel described the attack as unprovoked and based on ethnicity, adding ""ethnic slurs were used by the attackers.""The victims told police ""ethnic slurs were repeated and directed at them and mocking them for their heritage... it was clear they were picked on because they were Asian,"" Nelsen said.Video of the incident, which was recorded on a mobile device, shows the four girls yelling at the three male students who are seated on the train. Later, they approach the female victim who is standing and one of the suspects is seen pushing her toward the door before repeatedly slamming her head against the train door, the video shows.The female victim then falls to the ground and is kicked and punched by the teenagers for several seconds before someone is heard yelling ""Yo!"" to the teens and the video stops.  Police were first alerted of the attack when the female victim approached a transit officer for help at 3:45 pm, Chief Nestel said. She was then taken to Temple Hospital to be treated for a laceration.All four suspects were identified as Black girls with ages ranging from 13-16, police said.The mother of one of the teen suspects recognized her daughter from the video, which has been circulated online, and reported her to police, Nestel said at the press conference. Each of the suspects, who were not identified, has been charged with aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation, criminal conspiracy, simple assault, disorderly conduct, and a recklessly endangering another person, according to Krasner, the district attorney.One of the suspects was also charged with robbery for attempted theft of a victim's air pods, the prosecutor said.Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said he was appalled after learning about the incident and said the city would not tolerate such acts of hate. ""Those involved in the assault have been identified and will be held accountable. I want our residents to know that we will not tolerate any acts of hate,"" Kenney tweeted.Numerous Asian Americans have been targeted in violent attacks since last year. Earlier this week, Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of organizations dedicated to addressing anti-Asian discrimination, said it has received reports of 10,370 incidents from March 19, 2020, to September 30. The organization, which does not verify each report, said the most common form of incident reported was harassment (69%), followed by avoidance or shunning (16.3%) or physical assault (16.1%). A third of the incidents took place on public streets or inside a business, Stop AAPI Hate said, and more than 60% of the victims were women. ",0
23," (CNN)In Charlottesville, Virginia, a jury hears closing arguments in a case against the White power groups who organized the deadly rally there in 2017.  In Connecticut, a judge rules that conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is liable for defamation after years of attacks on the families who lost their children in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012.  In Washington, DC, a grand jury indicts Steve Bannon, the White House's chief strategist during much of the Trump administration, for criminal contempt after he refused a subpoena from the commission investigating the January 6 insurrection. A few days later, a judge sentences one of the insurrectionists to 41 months in prison.    And in courts scattered across the country, right-wing media outlets are facing billion-dollar civil suits from voting-machine makers Smartmatic and Dominion, in response to months of conspiracy-mongering about the machines and the 2020 election. Courts are currently clogged with cases that chart much of the right-wing extremism and misinformation campaigns of the last decade. The cases also reveal the makeshift nature of legal responses to those campaigns, an array of tools that might be able to act as deterrents -- though not able to deliver real justice.  It is at once both dispiriting and hopeful. Dispiriting, because it is a sign of how rapidly the far-right has grown and how deeply it has penetrated US politics. Hopeful, because it shows how robustly the legal system is responding to the twin dangers of extremism and disinformation. That robust response is far from automatic -- and even now, is likely less than the country needs. Both right-wing extremism and disinformation -- two interrelated phenomena in the US today, as the ""Stop the Steal"" rally and January 6 insurrection show -- are particularly thorny problems for the justice system to address. There are a number of reasons why.  On the legal front, fundamental rights to free association, free press and free speech have left courts cautious to intervene. It's one reason why the US doesn't have a federal domestic terrorism law to match its foreign terrorism regime: too many of the methods used against foreign terror outfits are not constitutional when used against US citizens.  On the cultural front, the valorizing embrace by the right of White Americans arming themselves has made it difficult for law enforcement and legislators to fully appreciate the depth of the threats facing the US.  Kyle Rittenhouse, who was found not guilty of all charges Friday, and has said he went to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to protect businesses and acted in self-defense when he shot three men, or Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who said they were defending themselves and their property when they brandished firearms at Black Lives Matter protesters in their St. Louis neighborhood, have been held up as heroes by the many on the right -- portrayed as extensions of the law rather than alleged violators of it. The McCloskeys spoke defiantly on the first night of the Republican National Convention in 2020. And while the number of far-right extremist groups exploded during President Barack Obama's campaign and administrations, it was not until 2020 that the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged violent White supremacy, much of it fueled by right-wing extremism, as ""the most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland."" There are also historical reasons that the legal system has struggled to address right-wing and White nationalist violence. As historian Kathleen Belew has documented in her 2018 book ""Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America,"" federal prosecutors attempted to bring conspiracy cases against White power groups who had engaged in terroristic violence and murder, only to repeatedly lose in court. In 1979, a group made up of members of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party killed five anti-racist protesters -- murders caught on video -- only to walk free when tried in court. Prosecutors learned from cases like that to go after violent extremists individually, winning high-profile cases like the one brought against the Oklahoma City bombers, but refraining from efforts to prosecute the entire network of activists behind the violence. As criminal prosecutions faltered, anti-racist organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center increasingly turned to civil suits to restrict the reach of White power organizing. As Belew notes, they successfully sued organizations like the White Patriot Party out of existence, and won damages for a man killed by White power groups in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1978. Civil suits proved to be a valuable tool for bankrupting, disbanding and exposing extremist networksThat is still true today. The suits against the organizers of the Charlottesville rally have the potential to financially cripple the groups responsible for the violence. And the civil suits against Jones and right-wing networks who spread election conspiracies could demonstrate that deliberate disinformation comes with a price tag no outlet can afford. The proliferation of far-right extremism has also prompted prosecutors to revisit the tools available for bringing criminal cases against violent extremists. In 2019, the federal government secured its first conspiracy convictions against right-wing extremists in decades against four members of the White supremacist group Rise Above Movement for their part in the deadly Charlottesville riot. This has encouraged prosecutors to pursue more conspiracy cases -- there are a number in progress involving January 6 insurrectionists -- although they acknowledge such cases are particularly difficult to prove in court. The double-prong legal approach -- pursuing both criminal charges and civil suits -- has been a key development in efforts to combat right-wing extremism. But perhaps the most notable change has been on the cultural front. For the first time in modern America, there is a robust conversation not just about the threat of right-wing extremism but expansive coverage of the networks that spread disinformation and feed far-right violence. That has given more Americans not only a language for talking about this threat but a conceptual framework for better understanding it. That's critical, because it makes it possible to envision a wider array of responses to that threat. Which is not to say all Americans are open to that new understanding of far-right violence. The right has nursed a conservative victim-martyr complex in response to these increased attacks on extremist groups. Efforts to prosecute the January 6 insurrections, for instance, have fed a cottage industry of media portraying the insurrectionists as righteous warriors and political prisoners (most recently Tucker Carlson's three-part series ""Patriot Purge""). Likewise, the Justice Department's efforts to protect school boards from threats of violence became fodder for outraged howls that the agency was persecuting parents. That creates real limits to prosecution as deterrence. Someone like Steve Bannon wears his indictment on contempt charges as a badge of honor, evidence of his unceasing loyalty to both Donald Trump and the political forces that brought him into the presidency. But more than that, the fear of White decline and persecution at the root of so much of right-wing politics -- and at the root of so much of US law and politics -- makes it particularly tricky to fully counter the extremism that results from that fear. Those limits are why the patchwork effort to dismantle extremist groups will remain necessary: with one political party unwilling to recognize the dangers of these forces -- indeed, welcoming them with open arms -- those seeking to rein them in will have to stay creative.

24," (CNN)House Democrats have finally passed President Joe Biden's sweeping social spending and climate change bill after months of feuding -- but that triumph is tempered by new questions over whether the $1.9 trillion measure can survive the Senate and then offer the short-term jolt of political energy Biden's wobbling presidency needs.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi drove through the legislation, which had caused fierce battles between progressive and moderate Democrats, only after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy staged one more delay -- with a histrionic filibuster-style speech that broke records and lasted more than eight hours overnight. Democrats hit back by postponing the vote until breakfast time, saying they wanted Americans to be awake to see them passing life-changing legislation.The Build Back Better bill represents one of the broadest reforms of education and health care in decades as part of a bill that also includes more than $500 billion for fighting climate change. But a bill that has already faced brushes with extinction and unleashed extraordinary bitterness between Democratic factions probably has its most perilous days ahead given deep skepticism of much of its text, including from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has not yet said he is even ready to vote to bring it up for debate. And the House isn't done with the measure either. A significantly pared down version is likely to reemerge from the Senate with provisions on paid family leave and immigration, which are cherished by liberals, expected to be cut. That could provoke a progressive backlash when an amended version returns to the House for final passage. So Biden's legacy achievement is far from assured.And it's unclear whether the massive bill will be a political winner in the short-term. While it would validate a core premise of Biden's case to voters last year that his years of Capitol Hill experience would help him pass big, serious, reform legislation, the bill may not address factors dragging down his presidency. Biden's approval ratings tumbled after a rough summer that included the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, a wave of Covid-19 infections from the Delta variant after the President said the pandemic was mostly over, and the inflation spike and a surge in gas prices that is leaving many voters disgruntled. It's also possible Democrats have overreached by trying to pass massive, liberal, social reform bills despite not having been given a wide mandate during the 2020 elections.Still, Pelosi hailed the measure as a victory in line with generations of legislation designed to improve peoples' lives by forging social progress.""For centuries, members of Congress (have) stood exactly where we stand to pass legislation of extraordinary consequence in our nation's history and for our nation's future,"" Pelosi said, after arriving in the House chamber shortly after 8 a.m. ET.""We, this democratic Congress are taking our place in the long and honorable heritage of our democracy, with legislation that will be the pillar of health and financial security in America.""The bitterness and chaos of the final hours before the vote epitomized the turmoil that has raged around the Build Back Better bill for months. In fact, the spectacle of Democrats squabbling over its size has obscured for the public much of what's in the package. And while it represents a cornerstone of Biden's agenda and is intended to ease economic troubles facing millions of Americans, polls show that many voters believe the President is not addressing the nation's most important issues. McCarthy's speech was in essence a lengthy preview of the Republican argument for next year's midterm elections, as he lambasted Biden over the high gas prices and inflation that are making Thanksgiving more expensive this year. He roasted the President's leadership in Afghanistan. His speech was also deeply repetitive and sometimes misleading about what was in the bill. It meandered into trivial matters with McCarthy running out of material -- he repeated several stories about his son's move to crime-plagued San Francisco and his visits to the southern border. At one point he digressed into musing about the size of carrots.McCarthy may also have had motives other than the bill at hand. He is facing increased pressure from allies of ex-President Donald Trump, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who suggested on Thursday that Trump should be elected speaker if the GOP wins the House next year. McCarthy has done everything he can to shield the ex-President from the consequences of his coup attempt and to turn his party into a compliant tool in Trump's political arsenal. But leading the charge with an hourslong speech that frustrated Democrats will certainly guarantee McCarthy plenty of coverage on social media -- and may garner praise from Trump himself.Uncertain fate in the Senate The Build Back Better bill has threatened at times to rip the Democratic Party apart and may still doom some threatened lawmakers in the midterm elections if it passes into law. Its fate in the Senate remains unclear. Manchin, in particular, wary of its cost, is still uncertain about the scale of many of its programs and the impact of the sprawling bill on inflation. The West Virginian's reservations, as well as those of Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, will present Biden with a test of his authority and stature since he had pledged to progressives that he would finally be able to get both behind the bill, and assure its passage through the Senate. Some progressives who wanted a much larger package are likely to be disappointed. But Manchin has huge leverage since Democrats cannot afford to lose a single member of their caucus in the 50-50 Senate.Still, the House passage of the bill after months of Democratic infighting, which at one point threatened to also scupper the bipartisan infrastructure plan, represents a genuine victory for the President, coming the same week that he signed that infrastructure bill into law. It could boost enthusiasm for his administration among grassroots Democrats he needs to stave off a disaster in next November's midterm elections. And while it has been roughly halved in size to win the support of moderate Democrats, the measure includes many programs on which the party has campaigned in successive elections. It would provide two years of free pre-K education and vastly expand home health care for sick and elderly Americans. The bill extends for one year a child tax credit that supporters say lifted millions out of poverty, expands Affordable Care Act subsidies, provides a Medicare hearing benefit, and provides tens of billions of dollars for affordable housing. If it eventually makes it through the Senate, where Democratic leaders are targeting a final vote before the end of the year, the measure will enhance Biden's claim for a place alongside some of his party's most significant social reformers. It would also be a signature achievement for Pelosi, potentially even outranking her successful push to pass the Affordable Care Act during the Obama administration, and could also be a career capstone for the country's first female speaker if Democrats lose control of the House next year.Dramatic final hours McCarthy played into such concerns in his marathon speech, warning that the measure's ""destructive policies"" would hammer American workers and families and could help doom the Democrats in the midterm elections.""It will crush American industries, it will destroy countless American jobs,"" he said, comparing the bill to the passage of Obamacare in 2010, when he said he saw Pelosi ""walk the Democratic members right down here and pass Obamacare and lose 63 seats."" The dramatic final hours ahead of the bill's likely passage underscored the perilous vote that some endangered lawmakers took to send it to the Senate. Moderate Democrats had waited until the Congressional Budget Office released its assessment of the impact of the measure on the deficit before agreeing to pass it. The CBO estimated that the measure would result in a net increase of $367 billion to the deficit between 2022 and 2031. The White House, however, insists that the bill will be fully paid for. It says it can make up the shortfall because the bill includes funding for better enforcement of Internal Revenue Service tax collecting. But the CBO score represents a huge opening for Republicans who will target vulnerable House members next year with their claims that Democrats are on a ""socialist"" spending spree that will bankrupt future generations ---  notwithstanding the fact the Republican Party cared little for the deficit when Trump was President. Republican leaders and allied groups were already seizing on the deficit question Thursday night. ""Representatives Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05), Ed Case (HI-01), Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), Kurt Schrader (OR-05), and Kathleen Rice (NY-04) promised their constituents that they would not raise the deficit. If they break their word and vote for this bill, they're betraying their constituents,"" Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement, for instance.In another twist, the bill's supporters must also overcome a wrangle over a provision that would expand a state and local tax deduction that critics -- including one of the bill's authors, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- have said is wrong and bad politics. Lifting the cap on state and local tax deductions has been a priority for members from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, but progressives say that the plan is a giveaway to the rich. In an unusual reversal of normal political practice, some conservative Republicans are making the same argument, despite their own 2017 tax bill, which capped the deductions and gave the wealthy and corporations tax cuts.This story has updated with House passage of the bill.

25," (CNN)House Democrats have voted to pass President Joe Biden's sweeping $1.9 trillion social safety net expansion legislation, a victory for the party even as the legislation faces a tough road ahead in the Senate.The final tally was 220 to 213. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the only Democrat to vote against the bill and no Republicans voted for it.The vote took place on Friday morning after House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy stalled an effort to vote Thursday evening by delivering a record-breaking marathon floor speech overnight.The sweeping economic legislation stands as a key pillar of Biden's domestic agenda. It would deliver on longstanding Democratic priorities by dramatically expanding social services for Americans, working to mitigate the climate crisis, increasing access to health care and delivering aid to families and children.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrated the legislation's passage after the vote. ""This bill is monumental. It's historic, it's transformative, it's bigger than anything we've ever done,"" she said at a press conference. But Democrats face a major challenge now that the bill has been approved by the House and must be taken up by the Senate, an effort that will put party unity to the ultimate test. Senate Democrats have no margin of error to approve the legislation and key lawmakers -- most prominently moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin -- have expressed concerns over elements of the plan as policy fights loom on the horizon.What's in the bill The social safety net expansion plan, known as the Build Back Better Act, represents a central part of Biden's policy agenda and an attempt by congressional Democrats to enact a major expansion of the social safety net.The House and Senate recently passed, and Biden then signed into law, a separate $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, which marked a major legislative achievement for both parties.The Build Back Better Act is an effort by Democrats to build on that investment in traditional infrastructure by making extensive investments to ramp up social programs and address the climate crisis.Among its many provisions, the legislation would create a universal pre-K program, extend the enhanced child tax credit and expand access to health care, affordable housing and home care for seniors.Democrats argue that the provisions in the bill are urgently needed and will widely benefit Americans. Republicans, meanwhile, have decried the legislation as a reckless and partisan tax and spending spree.The Congressional Budget Office released its final scoring for the bill early Thursday evening, estimating that the package ""would result in a net increase in the deficit totaling $367 billion,"" according to a summary.But the White House has worked to make the case that the bill will be fully paid for, despite the CBO analysis showing a shortfall.The CBO analysis does not include revenue from tighter IRS enforcement. The CBO estimated earlier that would raise $207 billion.The White House argues that increased IRS enforcement would actually raise more than what the CBO projects, meaning the bill would be fully paid for in their estimate.Tough road ahead in the Senate The legislation is expected to undergo major revisions in the Senate as Democrats who have expressed concerns over aspects of the package are likely to demand significant changes. That would then require the House to vote again -- on a final version of the legislation -- in the coming weeks before it goes to Biden's desk. Senate Democrats need all 50 members of their caucus to support the bill in order to pass it under a budget process they are using to advance the measure without GOP votes known as reconciliation. That makes the task for Democrats particularly difficult since it means there can be no defections and passage will require total unity. In an early sign of the impending efforts to change the bill, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in a statement after the House vote that the Senate will ""strengthen"" the bill.""I applaud Democrats in the House of Representatives for uniting to pass the Build Back Better Act. The Senate has an opportunity to make this a truly historic piece of legislation. We will listen to the demands of the American people and strengthen the bill,"" Sanders tweeted. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement after the House vote that the Senate ""will act as quickly as possible"" to take up the legislation. Pelosi downplayed the potential for significant changes to the legislation in the Senate. ""Ninety-some percent of the bill was written together, House, Senate, White House. There were some differences at the end, and we'll deal with those as we go forward,"" Pelosi said at a press conference after the House vote. ""We'll see where we need to, shall we say, reconcile our differences, but at the end of the day we will have a great bill,"" she said. Democrats pass bill after McCarthy's marathon speechDemocrats have an extremely slim majority in the House and can only afford to lose three votes and still pass legislation. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN ahead of the vote that he only knew of one expected Democratic defection, which was Golden. Golden told the Bangor Daily News on Thursday night he opposed the bill over provisions to raise the limit on state and local tax deductions, but did not rule out the possibility of backing the measure in future votes. The House vote Friday morning came after McCarthy stalled floor action with a speech railing against Democrats that stretched into the early hours of Friday morning.McCarthy took to the House floor at 8:38 p.m. ET on Thursday to begin speaking and did not finish speaking until eight hours and 32 minutes later, the longest House floor speech in the chamber's history. Hoyer announced shortly after midnight that the vote, which had been expected as soon as Thursday evening, would be postponed until later Friday. ""He wants to do it in the dead of night,"" Hoyer said, referring to McCarthy. ""We are going to do it in the day.""This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.",0
26," (CNN)President Joe Biden is getting closer to another major victory in what could be a legislative hat trick to round out his first year in office. After House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy delayed a vote in the lower chamber with an eight-hour speech last night, Democrats passed the Build Back Better Act, which is now expected to undergo major revisions in the Senate. Democrats, who have a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber, will have to see if they can get Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema on board. Although the Congressional Budget Office issued a better-than-expected score which should help ease any reservations the two moderate senators might have about the overall cost, it is still far from clear whether Democrats can seal the deal. Passing the legislation would count as a landmark achievement. The $1.9 trillion bill would drastically expand the social safety net and help fight climate change by providing subsidies for health care and childcare, free and universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with new tax credits for clean energy, investments in electric vehicles, and funding for environmental conservation. The bill will would also allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for older Americans on Medicare, provide new and improved affordable housing, include subsidies to make high-speed internet more accessible -- and more.If the legislation passes, Biden will be able to tout the Build Back Better Act, the American Rescue Plan and the $1 trillion infrastructure bill to join the ranks of the few Democrats since FDR who have been able to expand the role of the federal government in American life. In a sharp rebuke of Reaganism, Biden is building on the liberal legacy that stipulates government is essential to a healthy and equitable marketplace.  There are many reasons why President Biden has struggled politically in recent months. When it comes to the administration's problems with messaging, its reticence may be an overcorrection after the Trump era. Given that so many Americans grew tired of the onslaught of tweets, announcements and reports covering the turbulence in the White House under Trump, Biden may have initially chosen to step back from the limelight, working behind closed doors to try to focus on the challenges of governing. This strategy proved to be effective at the start of Biden's presidency, since it created the perception that the federal government was operating smoothly. But when pushing for big legislative initiatives, telling stories is part of what presidents do. Whenever the great Democratic presidents have successfully expanded the role of our government, they sold these laws to the American people as a way to address the major concerns of the day. Franklin Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" was an effort to address one of the worst economic crises in US history, offering workers and farmers a new social safety net that would ensure the bottom would not again fall out for average Americans. Lyndon B. Johnson's ""Great Society"" was an effort to use the growing wealth of this country to make the nation better than it had ever been by grappling with perennial challenges of poverty, racism, and inadequate education.It wasn't just that Roosevelt or Johnson had pithy catchphrases—those alone, as Harry Truman learned with the ""Fair Deal"" are not enough to guarantee success. It was the ability of these presidents to connect the dots between their proposals and the most pertinent concerns of the era in order to make a compelling case to the American people that these legislative packages were critical to the country's future.For Americans in 2021, nothing comes close to the pandemic and the problems it exposed and exacerbated. The nation and the world, lived through one of the most traumatic and unsettling crises of recent decades. Covid-19 ravaged the world and inflicted an enormous death toll while upending our way of life, widening racial and economic disparities, and inflicting a psychological toll that could have a lasting impact on people for years to come. While we are all focused on returning to some semblance of normality as soon as possible, the notion that we can simply move on or that the damage of the pandemic can easily be undone is shortsighted.Joe Biden won the 2020 election over Donald Trump for many reasons, one of which was a desperate desire for efficient and coherent leadership that could help us all climb out of the desperate state the pandemic put us in. As Biden tries to push his capstone legislation toward final passage by Christmas, he has to come back to this basic concern. Too often, Biden has not done enough to explain how his legislative push is as integral to our country's recovery as the vaccine rollout.In the last few days, the administration has finally started to push back against inflation hawks by explaining how the infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better package would actually reduce basic costs for American families. But he needs to do more by laying out what's in these bills and how they'll make a positive impact on millions of Americans. Lowering the cost of health care and child care while providing support for caregiving jobs, for example, addresses longstanding problems that came to the forefront during the pandemic. More aggressive efforts to deal with climate change is also part of how we avoid another global crisis from unfolding.   The more Biden can do to explain how his agenda addresses the Covid-19 pandemic and how his policies will make us more resilient going forward, the more pressure he can exert on Senators Manchin and Sinema to finally join the rest of their party in moving forward with this historic legislation.",0
27," (CNN)Money rained down on a San Diego freeway Friday morning, when one of the doors of an armored truck popped open and bags holding cash fell out.The resulting scramble by drivers to scoop up the bills completely shut down northbound Interstate 5, according to the California Highway Patrol (CHP).""There was cash all over the freeway,"" the CHP spokesperson told CNN affiliate KFMB. ""People stopped in the lanes, completely blocked the lanes, started picking up the cash.""At least two people were placed in handcuffs at the scene after locking their keys in their cars and blocking the lanes, according to the spokesperson.""We're working with the FBI now, it's a joint investigation and if you have picked up any of the cash, I highly suggest you turn it in to the CHP office immediately because we do have a lot of evidence to follow up on,"" he said.",0
28,"New York (CNN Business)The oil market has gone from booming to busting, much to the relief of inflation-weary American drivers ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.US crude tumbled to a fresh seven-week low on Friday, settling at $76.10 a barrel. The slide is good news for American drivers hurt by the seven-year high in gasoline prices — a crunch that has soured consumers' views on the US economy. ""We will definitely see some pricing relief on gasoline at the pump,"" Tom Kloza, president of the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN on Friday, adding that the relief will be ""feather-like as opposed to plunges.""After a relentless rise, the national average gas price has finally leveled off at $3.41 a gallon, according to AAA. That's roughly flat from a week ago.""It looks for now as though the 2021 peaks have been established,"" Kloza said.Lockdown jittersUnfortunately, one of the catalysts for Friday's tumble in the market is another ominous development on the Covid front: Austria announced plans Friday to impose a national lockdown, the first in Europe this fall, in a bid to reverse a spike in Covid-19 cases.The lockdown is raising fears in the oil market of tough new health restrictions elsewhere that will slow the economic comeback and eat into energy demand.""The demand signals today are overwhelmingly bearish,"" Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a note on Friday. ""The risk is real in Europe, especially if Austria's move to lockdown has a domino effect across the continent. If Germany follows suit, sub-$80 price levels may be here to stay.""Will China and America team up?Beyond the lockdown fears, oil markets remain jittery over the specter of the United States and China teaming up to intervene in the previously red-hot energy markets.Since crashing to negative-$40 a barrel in April 2020, US crude has climbed as much as $125 a barrel because supply simply hasn't kept up with demand. OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have only gradually increased production. US oil companies haven't been in a rush to add supply either.A coordinated release from two of the world's biggest energy consumers would have a bigger impact than if the Biden administration acted alone to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Officials in China put out a statement on Friday suggesting that a release of barrels from the country's emergency reserve is on the table.""The bureau is pushing forward with crude oil release-related work at the moment,"" authorities that oversee China's strategic oil reserves said in a statement to CNN.According to a readout published by the White House, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed during their virtual summit this week the ""importance of taking measures to address global energy supplies.""A coordinated release by the United States and China could also be used as a bargaining tool to get OPEC+ to open up the taps, after months of refusing to do so.""There is firepower with a concerted effort,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.'Short-term fix'Still, this is not a long-term solution, as releasing barrels from emergency reserves doesn't solve the underlying supply-demand mismatch. And these emergency reserves hold a finite amount of oil — crude that is typically reserved for supply shocks, not surging demand amid an economic recovery.Releasing barrels today leaves the reserves with less of buffer for the next crisis, whether it's a hurricane, a conflict in the Middle East or another supply shock.Goldman Sachs reiterated in a new report to clients on Thursday that a coordinated release would ""only provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit.""The Wall Street bank argued this coordinated release is now ""fully priced in,"" meaning the impact to markets has already happened.""In fact, if such a release is confirmed and manages to keep oil prices depressed in the context of low trading activity into year-end, it would create clear upside risks to our 2022 price forecast,"" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote.In other words, at least some on Wall Street are already looking past this emergency intervention — before it even happens — and predicting higher prices ahead.",0
29,"New York (CNN Business)An animated dumpling called ""Dart,"" with a shiny gold chrome body that pops out of its head when you squeeze its squishy cheeks, is creating quite a stir as parents scramble to score one of this year's must-have toys.Dart belongs to a family of interactive dumplings from toymaker WowWee that hit stores in mid July. They're basically what the name suggests -- squeezable but inedible dumplings big enough to fit into the palm of your hand.And they're increasingly difficult to find. Like with everything, blame the supply chain.""It's a s**tshow,"" said Michael Yanofsky, the company's managing director of sales. ""It's not just the holdup at the ports, it's labor shortages and backups all along the transportation network that's been a struggle to get the toys to retailers.""""Our bet is made for Black Friday,"" said Yanofsky. ""Whatever inventory of dumplings is in is it and we hope it all makes it onto store shelve. There's no chance of getting more unless we put them on planes.""WowWee is trying to navigate the serious supply chain issues to ensure it has enough inventory overall of its dumplings to satisfy strong demand through to Christmas. The dumplings, like most toys sold in the United States, are made in China. Sold outThe first four in the lineup are named ""Doe,"" ""Dip,"" ""Dee"" and ""Dot."" They each speak a weird ""Squish-Pop"" language and giggle and laugh. The cheeks change color and the top of their head lights up to a color code that matches their current ""mood"" -- energetic, happy, silly. Then along came ""Mel the Marshamallow, "" ""Peace the Peach"" and ""Coco the Cotton Candy Cloud.""But it's Dart, the golden dumpling who flaunts 24K gold glasses, that everyone desperately wants. He's sold out on Amazon (AMZN) where WowWee launched him at the end September. Dart has been popping up on eBay  (EBAY)at twice the retail price.Its popularity even caught the attention of MyBookie.com, an offshore gaming site, which was accepting bets this month on whether the squishy little golden dumpling would sell out on Amazon before Black Friday. Hitting all the trendsThe $15 dumpling toy is popular because it's hitting a few dominant trends in toys right now, said Marissa Silva, editor-in-chief of The Toy Insider, a toy review and news website.She said kids are obsessed with collecting tiny cute toys that come in tiny packages, as proven by the Shopkins mania. ""Dumplings are a little bit bigger but collectible,"" said Silva. ""They're also affordable and not overly complicated for kids to figure out.""Plus, the soft squishy texture of the dumpling and the popping out of their body also cleverly plays into the current bubble fidget poppers toy craze.There's one other appeal: the food inspiration.""Food-themed toys continue to be very hot trend. We've seen this with Shopkins and with Mini Brands,"" said Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of Toys, Tots, Pets & More, an industry review website. Mini Brands are tiny shrunken versions of popular consumer products like a can of Spam, or a bottle of Dove Body Wash that come hidden in tiny bags.""""These food-inspired toys are also so easy for kids to have fun with on social media,"" said Silver.The squishy dumplings are the brainchild of Sydney Wiseman, vice president of brand development and creative strategy for WowWee. She came up with the idea for them 18 moths ago. ""I wanted to do a toy based on a dumpling for a long time,"" she said. And she wanted the dumpling characters to be in a band. That aspect is infused in their look and the accessories they wear.More are comingWowWee in August announced a partnership with Nickelodeon to produce animated digital music videos that feature the squishy characters in a band.Wiseman is thrilled with the dumplings popularity overall, and especially of Dart's, which WowWee only produced 100,000 pieces of as a very limited character. She said Dart holds a special meaning for the WowWee team. ""He's named after a dear friend of ours at WowWee, Art Janis, who recently passed away,"" she said.There's still a possibility to score Dart after Black Friday. WowWee is launching a two-pack set with the golden dumpling and a rose gold dumpling on November 30 on Amazon.",0
30,"Washington, DC (CNN)Westport, Connecticut police chief Foti Koskinas would love it if his patrol cars could drive themselves, but his department isn't buying Teslas equipped with ""full self-driving.""  Local governments like Westport and businesses big and small sing the benefits of electric vehicles like Teslas. Westport has saved thousands on fuel and maintenance since purchasing a Model 3 in 2019. Police departments are among the fleet operators that are increasingly turning to electric vehicles for the economic and environmental benefits. Koskinas said he's received more than 500 inquiries from departments around the world asking about Westport's use of electric vehicles.  Westport has saved nearly $7,000 a year on fuel and maintenance costs, he said. There could be more savings coming. Westport expects to save $5,000 a vehicle if it can use Tesla's on-car computer, rather than installing its own for critical features like scanning license plates, controlling lights and sirens, and radioing colleagues. Discussions are on-going between Westport and Tesla, Koskinas said. But for all their Tesla enthusiasm, there's one feature they overwhelmingly aren't touching — ""full self-driving."" Some say the technology isn't ready yet.  The $10,000 optional software feature includes driver-assist features that Tesla hopes will one day allow the cars to drive themselves. (The price is likely to increase, as it has in the past, so the best time to buy is likely now, for those who believe in the technology's future.) Not all Teslas have ""full self-driving."" Currently, ""full self-driving"" is available in Beta form and has only been released to a limited group of people. It can change lanes in some cases, respond to most traffic signals and steer the car.  The technology is far from perfect and requires an attentive driver behind the wheel to take control at a moment's notice. It ""may do the wrong thing at the worst time,"" Tesla warns.  Koskinas can envision the benefits if his department's cars could be trusted to drive responsibly, always doing the right thing. He said officers responding to incidents sometimes end up riding in an ambulance to a hospital, to offer support. But they must leave their patrol car behind.  ""How great if that vehicle drives itself to the hospital and meets the officer there?"" he said.  If Teslas could do that, he might buy ""full self-driving,"" he said.   ""We're just not there,"" Koskinas said of the technology today. The ""full-self driving"" option can be added to Teslas in the future even if it is not purchased at the time of sale.  Westport, Connecticut is one of six police departments that told CNN Business that they have purchased at least one Tesla, but not the ""full self-driving"" feature.  Police departments aren't the only ones taking a pass. Hertz announced in October it will purchase 100,000 Teslas, but not ""full self-driving."" Brightline, the private train operator in Florida, has a Tesla fleet of nearly 50 vehicles to give passengers rides to its train stations, which reopened this month. Revel, a mobility startup, started using Tesla Model Ys to offer rides in Manhattan this year.  Most of the Tesla buyers decline to say why they are not buying ""full self-driving."" But the technology's limits appear clear and are likely a factor. Thilo Koslowski, a consultant at AutoDGTL focused on automotive technology, told CNN Business that ""full self-driving"" is not currently a good value for fleet operators, given the technology's limits and its cost. ""They're not gaining the benefits they're looking for,"" Koslowski said. ""It's not full self-driving. It becomes a question of if it's worthwhile to spend the money."" Fleet operators want safer driving and more productive vehicles, according to Koslowski. He said there is no objective data proving that ""full self-driving"" is safer than a human driver. ""Full self-driving"" has not been shown to make Teslas today more productive, he said. Fleet operators could theoretically face liability risks if ""full self-driving"" would be active during a crash, according to Koslowski. ""That risk overshadows any potential benefits you could get from this,"" Koslowski said. ""It's such a murky gray area that I think the risk is way too high for rental companies to do that.""  The technology's limitations have been documented. Tesla drivers testing ""full self-driving"" have described it as inconsistent, sometimes impressing them, other times alarming them. Videos shot by drivers using Teslas with ""full self-driving"" show that it can brake and turn unexpectedly, and sometimes drive down the middle of the road rather than making space for other drivers.  Several Teslas using ""full self-driving"" have crashed into curbs, damaging the cars' wheels. A person who identified themselves as a Tesla owner reported to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration this month that their Tesla had been severely damaged after crashing into a vehicle while using ""full self-driving."" The agency is seeking more information about the crash, according to spokesperson Lucia Sanchez.  Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has alluded to the limits of ""full self-driving.""   ""We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition,"" he said on a Tesla earnings call this summer.  At the time he also questioned the merits of paying for a subscription version of ""full self-driving."" Then drivers with ""full self-driving"" were receiving a limited set of features, like automated lane changes.  ""Like right now, is it -- does it make sense for somebody to do [full self-driving] subscription? I think it's debatable. But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear,"" Musk said.  Tesla has repeatedly missed deadlines on when it expects its autonomous system to be widely deployed and has not issued a recent estimate for a broad deployment of ""full self-driving.""  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.  ",0
31," (CNN)What's that we hear? Is it the sound of prominent conservatives and Trump allies openly rebuking former President Donald Trump? Are these the early murmurs of a conservative backlash against Trump? And is it possible a political lane is opening for another Republican presidential candidate in 2024?It's too soon to know, of course, and there's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.The statements from Rupert Murdoch -- who controls a media empire that includes, among other properties, the shamelessly pro-Trump Fox News -- and from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- an adviser who worked with the former president and helped him prepare for the presidential debates during the 2020 election -- may serve as a test for Republicans who understand just how harmful Trump's dominance of the GOP is, and how it could ultimately sink the party.It was startling when Murdoch, addressing his company at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said that the United States faces a number of major political decisions that conservatives will fail to shape unless Trump moves on. ""The current American political debate is profound,"" he said, citing education, welfare and economic opportunity. ""It is crucial that conservatives play an active, forceful role in that debate,"" he added, ""but that will not happen if President Trump stays focused on the past.""Murdoch is not alone in arguing that Trump is a threat to conservatives. Christie, who has just published a new book that looks very much like his unofficial entry into the 2024 presidential race, is making the same case, only more forcefully.Consider the title of Christie's book -- which effectively labels Trump a threat to the GOP: ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Notice that Trump fits two of the three reasons the party needs saving (by Christie, presumably).Murdoch and Christie are not the first Republicans who have stood up to the former president --  but their rebukes of Trump are markedly different. Trump's early critics, like Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and others, melted into passionate defenders once their criticisms proved perilous to their own standing. Their reversals bring to mind a quote often attributed to Groucho Marx: ""Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others."" Christie says many in the GOP are frightened of Trump, whose ""conduct is meant to instill fear."" Conservative Republicans who refuse to fall in line, such as Rep. Liz Cheney, are being hounded out of a party that is increasingly remade into the former president's raging, iconoclastic and intolerant brand.Sure, it's possible Murdoch and Christie's words may also fail to change the course of the GOP, but their criticism is different. They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party -- and the rest of the country -- that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.Coincidentally or not, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, finally acknowledged Biden's win on Thursday, more than a year after the 2020 vote. ""Painfully,"" she said, ""Joe Biden won the election and it's very painful to watch. He's the President. We know that."" Murdoch and Christie undoubtedly have their own personal motives for speaking out against Trump in this moment, and there's plenty of evidence to warrant accusations of hypocrisy. Murdoch, whose Fox News -- home of Tucker Carlson, a purveyor of harmful lies and propaganda about everything from the Covid vaccine to American democracy -- is still serving Trump's goals. But Fox News now faces billion-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by two voting technology companies that allege the network spread false claims of election fraud. Murdoch might be driven by a fear of liability and the potential damage additional lawsuits could inflict on his bottom line if Fox News continues to follow Trump down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and baseless claims. There is, also the possibility that he cares about the future of conservative politics, and genuinely fears the GOP might get trampled if Trump doesn't let up.Christie, for his part, is trying to promote his book and his prospects of occupying the White House.Still, it is remarkable that they have done the calculus and decided they can benefit from speaking out against the former president, even after other Republicans have been badly hurt by doing the same thing. I think their calculation makes sense. With President Joe Biden's ratings sinking, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are doomed. But it is Republicans who may be doomed if they continue to stick with the former president.There's no doubt the Biden administration is terrible at messaging. The economy is booming and yet consumers are feeling pessimistic. Meanwhile, Biden is making important legislative progress, and the inflationary pressures that are creating the false impression that the economy is failing could be resolved in time to boost Democrats' fortunes.Even if Democrats are still in the doldrums in 2024, it's hard to imagine that voters will be yearning for another four years of Trumpian chaos. Biden may look uninspiring now, but the former president, who had the most consistently poor approval ratings of any president in the modern era, remains highly unpopular and controversial. Do Republicans want a candidate embroiled in endless -- and serious -- legal troubles? According to the New York Times, prosecutors are likely to impanel a grand jury in Georgia in the criminal investigation of the former president's attempt to overturn the 2020 election (In September, he suggested he was being unfairly targeted, saying, ""Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me."") Meanwhile, prosecutors in New York have convened a second grand jury to hear evidence about Trump Organization's business practices, according to the Washington Post. (The first grand jury, which convened this spring, charged two Trump companies and an executive with tax evasion. Trump, who was not charged, blasted the indictment and called the investigation a ""political witch hunt."")A Pew poll conducted in September found that two-thirds of Republicans want Trump to remain a major force in the party, but only 44% want him to run again. One-third of Republicans and 92% of Democrats don't want him to be a major national political figure going forward. That's not the arithmetic of victory. There's the potential for a post-Trump Republican Party to gain ground. It still seems like a long shot at this point, but if his critics are successful in persuading the GOP to move in a different direction, there's a chance American democracy can return some semblance of normality, where political leaders debate what policies are best for the country, without fear of upsetting the tender, explosive feelings of a very bad loser.",0
32," (CNN)While the US has been in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic, another public health crisis has surged past a tragic milestone. Over 100,000 people died from drug overdoses between May 2020 and April 2021, according to provisional data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday -- a 28.5% increase from the 12 months prior and a record high for the US.   Though these statistics are new, the problem is not. Overdose deaths have been trending upward for years.  A key aspect of the issue, experts say, has been the rise of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can be up to 100 times more potent than morphine, is much cheaper to produce than traditional plant-based opioids and is often mixed with street drugs without the buyer's knowledge, increasing the risk of a fatal overdose. Combine the growing popularity of fentanyl with a pandemic that has forced people into isolation, and stripped them of the in-person relationships and support systems they depend on, and it's easy to understand the spike in overdose deaths since lockdowns began.  But despite the macabre picture the trend lines paint, there is much that can be done to curb the overdose death rate, says CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who served as the health commissioner of Baltimore from 2014 to 2018 during which time the city had some of the highest opioid overdose rates in the US, and who currently serves as advisory board chair of the Behavioral Health Group, a network of outpatient opioid treatment and recovery centers in the US.  Many of the programs Wen implemented in Baltimore -- including promoting the widespread availability of naloxone, the fast-acting opioid antidote, piloting test strips that can alert users to the presence of fentanyl in street drugs and increasing treatment for opioid use disorders -- she feels have the potential to curb overdose deaths across the nation.  To address the opioid crisis we must refocus on a single mission, says Wen, and remind ourselves that when it comes to public health, we are all striving for the same outcome: saving lives.  The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: Experts have attributed the recent spike in overdose deaths to the pandemic and to the rise of fentanyl. Can you explain how those two factors impacted the overdose death rate? Wen: Prior to the pandemic, we were already having an epidemic of opioid overdoses that was driven primarily by fentanyl, which is many times stronger than heroin and is often used to cut street drugs. So, if someone is taking their usual amount of heroin, for instance, but there's something in there that's many times stronger, they are much more likely to overdose and die.  And then the pandemic happened. Public health resources were already stretched to the limits, so the people working on the opioid crisis had to shift focus to addressing the pandemic. This was necessary, but it also left a gaping hole in the social safety net. On top of that, we know that addiction is a disease of isolation, and recovery depends on relationships. Many people during the pandemic lost their health insurance and the ability to get treatment. Some may have lost other social resources like stable housing or faced food insecurity. Treating their disease of addiction may not have been top of mind. We also can't forget that addiction and mental health issues are diseases of despair, and this pandemic has worsened mental health for so many people. I think that is yet another layered component of what was already a major problem that has lost attention and lost funding and lost people working to solve it. CNN: How can overdose deaths be addressed while the pandemic is still ongoing and resources are still stretched thin? Wen: We can save lives right now through harm reduction practices. That includes getting naloxone, the opioid antidote, to as many people as possible in communities. We should also look at other classic harm reduction practices like making fentanyl test strips widely available. This does not mean condoning or encouraging drug use, but rather if people are going to be using drugs, they need to know if there's fentanyl in their supply so that they can reduce the risk of a fatal overdose. Then there are safe injection facilities, which in Portugal and the other countries have been shown to save lives. They are controversial, but if our focus is going to be on preventing deaths, then we should be looking at all strategies that are effective.  We also need to ensure that people have access to evidence-based treatment. For treating individuals with opioid use disorder, for instance, that means a combination of medications like buprenorphine or methadone, along with psychosocial support. There needs to be adequate insurance coverage for these treatments -- and while telemedicine should be enabled and allowed, we also must also recognize that many patients need brick and mortar care. Ultimately, the treatment for individuals with addiction needs to be viewed the same as treatment for people with any other medical illness.  CNN: What about longer-term solutions that can be implemented?  Wen: Strengthening our public health infrastructure is critical. Covid-19 has laid bare the many problems, including the underinvestment in and undervaluing of our public health system. We have seen what happens when resources are diverted from existing critical priorities to Covid-19. We, of course, need to focus on this because this is an existential emergency, but these other crises have not gone away. CNN: What are some of the barriers to implementing these policies and initiatives you just described? Wen: For the most part, thankfully, there has been bipartisan agreement that this is an urgent issue and needs to be a top priority. There are partisan differences around certain key elements -- criminalizing of drug use, for example. Many of us in public health would say that it is far past time for addiction to be treated as a disease, and not as a crime.  The harm reduction practices that I mentioned earlier are also not universally accepted by policymakers at this point. Most people of various political ideologies would support naloxone, because it's hard to be against the idea that if somebody's overdosing in front of you, you should save their lives. But syringe exchange programs, which are often sites where naloxone is distributed, are controversial. Many parts of the country still do not allow them for fear that they condone drug use, when what they actually do is to prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis, and provide outreach to individuals who could be susceptible to overdose.  In addition, there is a major issue around treatment. The concern here is not even so much political as in a partisan divide, but rather political as in what resources we are willing to devote to this issue. There are solutions we could tap into, but do we have the political will to devote the resources to finally solving this crisis? I understand that there are many funding priorities in front of the Biden administration and in front of Congress. The question is: where does addiction fall in their list of priorities? ​​CNN: When you were health commissioner of Baltimore, you focused heavily on implementing specific measures such as widespread access to naloxone and increased access to treatment as part of your initiative to combat the opioid crisis in the city. Do you think it's possible to implement a similar initiative on a national scale, or is this problem something that needs individualized approaches specific to each locality? Wen: There are general guiding principles that are necessary for addressing addiction in every community. And those principles include harm reduction, increasing access to treatment and strengthening public health infrastructure. Those are the three pillars that are uniform across all parts of the country. When I was the health commissioner in Baltimore, I worked closely with my colleagues in public health around the country, including Dr. Rahul Gupta, who at the time was the commissioner of health in West Virginia. He primarily oversaw a rural constituency and I oversaw an urban one, but together we wrote about how the programs that we implemented are similar. They were tailored to the specific constituencies we represented and the hospitals, nonprofits and community organizations that we worked with. And while there are different methods of reaching people in urban areas versus rural ones, the principles and the guiding values are the same. So, I think there is a way to scale up what we know works.  CNN: Do you see this as an issue that should be primarily addressed at the federal, state or local level of government? Wen: It needs to be a combination. The funding has to come from the federal government and then must be distributed to communities based on level of need. The communities then are best positioned to understand how to use that funding for specific programs or resources in their area. The federal government, though, is not going to give money and say, ""Do whatever you want with it."" There are very clear guidelines on how that money should be spent. And in this regard, the federal government has a major role to play in defining the evidence-based treatment that the funds can be used for. We don't want federal money, for instance, going toward rapid detox programs, which can be harmful and increase the rate of overdoses.  At the same time, states have to do their part. Those that have not expanded Medicaid need to. We need to have policies that treat addiction as we do all other medical illnesses.CNN: What advice would you have for people who are facing addiction and don't know how to seek help or what resources are available to them?Wen: If somebody struggling with addiction has a primary care provider that they trust and go to regularly, their doctor is the best person to seek help from because that person will know them, will understand their history, and will know what resources are available in their community. Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website has a list of providers in different parts of the country and a person's local health department may be able to refer them to treatment options depending on the part of the country they live in. In some parts of the country, hotlines exist for people to call if they are seeking help.  CNN: Are you optimistic that we will be able to turn around this trend? Wen: Public health is now right in the crosshairs of the ideological and culture wars in a way that it should not be. It's not helpful when masks and vaccinations are seen as political issues, and public health has now been largely equated with Covid-19. So, if Covid-19 is seen as a partisan issue, public health by default becomes partisan as well. Fighting drug overdose deaths is one of the issues where there is very clear bipartisan agreement that we have a problem, unlike the issue of Covid-19. Not everyone agrees that Covid is even a crisis. Addressing the opioid crisis is a way to get back to a bipartisan consensus on public health. I'm not saying that is the reason why we should be addressing the overdose crisis. We should be addressing it because it killed over a 100,000 people in America last year; we should be addressing it because it was a crisis before the pandemic and then it became largely forgotten.  But, as an added benefit, addressing the opioid crisis could get us back to the heart of the matter: how public health can unite rather than divide.",0
33," (CNN)The exonerations, after 56 years, of two Black men convicted of the assassination of Malcolm X rights a grave miscarriage of justice and opens new questions about race and America's criminal justice system. Spurred by decades of effort by historians and further accelerated by the widely acclaimed 2019 Netflix documentary series, ""Who Killed Malcolm X,"" the Manhattan District Attorney's Office reopened the investigation into Malcolm X's February 21, 1965, assassination. I participated in this film as an on-air historical analyst. Two of the men found guilty in 1966, Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam (formerly Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson) have now been exonerated. Aziz, who is 83, was paroled in 1985 while Islam, who was released in 1987, died in 2009 at the age of 74.  According to The New York Times, the 22-month investigation -- conducted jointly by the Manhattan DA's office and lawyers for Aziz and Islam -- revealed that after Malcolm X's killing, the FBI and the New York Police Department withheld evidence that would likely have made a jury find the defendants not guilty. ​ Aziz, Islam and a third man -- Mujahid Abdul Halim (known as Talmadge Hayer and Thomas Hagan) -- were convicted. For years, Aziz and Islam said they were innocent; Halim said he took part in the assassination but affirmed the innocence of the other two men at trial and after. According to the New York Times, the recent inquiry uncovered FBI documents including information that implicated others and not Aziz and Islam.Prosecutors' notes indicate they failed to disclose that undercover officers were present at the time of the shooting. Police department files also showed that a local reporter got a call the morning of the shooting indicating that Malcolm X would be killed. Investigators also interviewed a living witness who backed up an alibi for Aziz. Overall, the Times reported, the reinvestigation found that had this additional material been shown to a jury, it may well have led to acquittals. Cyrus Vance, the outgoing Manhattan DA, publicly apologized. ""This points to the truth that law enforcement over history has often failed to live up to its responsibilities,"" Vance said to the Times. ""These men did not get the justice that they deserved."" On Thursday, New York Supreme Court Administrative Judge Ellen Biben granted the motion to vacate Aziz and Islam's convictions and expressed regret for the ""serious miscarriages of justice in this case."" Vance apologized in court for ""serious, unacceptable violations of law and the public trust"" and said, ""We can't restore what was taken away from these men and their families, but by correcting the records, perhaps we can begin to restore that faith.""In the case of Aziz, this exoneration means that he will have witnessed a kind of rough justice in his own lifetime. For Islam these admissions have come too late. Their exonerations join a spate of recent events that illustrate how America's racial history is being rewritten and how the past continues to inform the present. For instance, Louisiana's governor is poised to grant a posthumous pardon to Homer Plessy, convicted for boarding a White-only train car and the Black plaintiff in the landmark 1896 Supreme Court case that ratified ""separate but equal"" as constitutionally permissible.  These exonerations are especially relevant now, not only because they represent another instance of Black defendants receiving unfair treatment before the justice system but because they reframe history at a moment when the failures of that system continue to reverberate through national politics in the United States.Knowing the fuller truth about his death allows us to see Malcolm X in a new light. Malcolm's activism honed in on racial disparities in the criminal justice system from firsthand personal experiences. Malcolm X represents one of the most important working-class Black political activists and organizers in American history. Importantly, Malcolm became an ardent prisoner rights activist. These new revelations about the corrupt investigation into his death helps us to better understand why, in life, Malcolm emerged as a relentless critic of the justice system's mistreatment of Black America.  A formerly incarcerated prisoner himself -- turned religious leader, political organizer and public intellectual -- Malcolm used the ministry of the Nation of Islam (NOI) to restore the lost promise of scores of Black men and women in postwar America. After his release on parole from a Massachusetts prison in August 1952, Malcolm shared his story as a former inmate with all who would listen. He never forgot his time in prison nor the inmates who served as mentors, students, counselors and inspiration for his later activism. And Malcolm continued to fearlessly confront police violence during his years as an activist. The 1957 police beating of NOI member Johnson Hinton helped cement Malcolm's local legend after he compelled the NYPD to provide the battered Hinton with medical assistance. Malcolm's arrival on the scene with a battalion of NOI members changed minds and hearts in Harlem. Five years later the police killing of Ronald Stokes, an NOI member whom Malcolm considered a friend in Los Angeles, inspired a crusade against law enforcement violence that found the NOI's national representative crafting coalitions with civil rights leaders to denounce police brutality.  Malcolm's greatest legacy remains his ability to speak truth to power. His activism echoes across generations and can be seen in the Black Lives Matter movement as well as efforts to end systems of punishment by investing in historically disadvantaged people.  Malcolm X's 1965 assassination remains one of the most traumatic events of the 1960s. The case remains unsolved, a reflection of not just a racially biased justice system, but a criminally negligent one as well. For 56 years the murder of one of the most impactful political leaders in American history has been an open wound because of what Deborah Francois, a lawyer for Aziz and Islam, described to the Times as ""extreme and gross official misconduct.""This astonishing fact calls into question the integrity of some of the basic institutions within our democracy. The right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence and an investigation led by ethical servants of the public trust is sacrosanct -- yet, in large parts of this nation, woefully absent then -- and for some, now.  The struggle for Black dignity and citizenship to which Malcolm devoted his whole life continues. The lawyers and staff of the Innocence Project, the filmmakers and team behind the ""Who Killed Malcolm X?"" documentary, the scholarly work of the late historian Manning Marable, the late journalist Les Payne and Tamara Payne all contributed to this outcome.Crucial to any understanding of what actually happened to Malcolm X is his public rupture with the NOI and conflict with its leader, Elijah Muhammad, over what Malcolm saw as his former mentor's hypocrisy over marital infidelity and other transgressions. Malcolm was aware of his lifetime of rumors that NOI was a threat to him. ""I live like a man who is dead already,"" he told reporters at the time. For decades scholars activists, and community members have railed against the incarceration of Aziz and Islam as a gross miscarriage of justice. It was this and surely much more. And despite the welcome results of these decades of work and nearly two years of investigation on top of it, we still have more questions than answers when it comes to Malcolm X's assassination. Why did law enforcement withhold evidence to convict Aziz and Islam? What role did the FBI and NYPD play? Why did it take 56 years to persuade the Manhattan DA's office to reinvestigate? Malcolm X's legacy continues to haunt America's criminal justice system in ways that are both sobering and hopeful. The exonerations of Aziz and Islam represent a continuation of Malcolm's struggle. Malcolm, in so many ways, called America toward the racial and political reckoning it continues to experience. The trials of the White men accused of killing Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and of Kyle Rittenhouse in Wisconsin illuminate both how far we have come since the civil rights era and the considerable distance we have to travel to achieve racial equity under law not only in theory but in practice.

34," (CNN)Steve Bannon's relationship with former President Donald Trump has landed him in the dock, charged with criminal contempt of Congress.  Doubling down on his Trump-emulating defiance, Bannon has retained the ex-president's former lawyer, David Schoen -- perhaps most famous for taking part in the defense in the second impeachment when seven members of Trump's own party voted to convict him.  Schoen is making the rounds offering Bannon's public defense: He was just following the advice of his (prior) lawyer, who told him to respect Trump's claims of executive privilege. But Schoen's arguments are no better now than they were during Trump's impeachment trial. It's worth taking the time to debunk them. First, Trump is no longer the president, and he doesn't get to invoke executive privilege to shield himself and his cronies from accountability. As Judge Tonya Chutkan held last week in denying Trump's attempt to block the National Archives from releasing January 6 documents: Presidents aren't kings -- and Trump isn't even the president.  The ex-president's invocation of the privilege is not a sufficient basis to take the law into your own hands and simply refuse to show up, as Bannon did. Trump helped Bannon evade accountability once, pardoning him after he was arrested for wire fraud. Not this time.   Trump's attempt at invoking the privilege is especially weak here because he wasn't acting as chief executive when he planned and implemented his effort to overturn the election. He was acting as a defeated candidate, and there is no candidate privilege.  Second, there's no such thing as podcaster privilege. Even if Trump could invoke the privilege, it wouldn't protect Bannon -- he was a podcast host, not a White House advisor, on January 6. Bannon's whisperings with other conspirators also aren't Oval Office advice to the president. Third, Bannon can't hide behind his lawyer any more than he can hide behind Trump. Schoen claims that Bannon was merely acting on the advice of his lawyer, who told him to honor Trump's privilege invocation. But the majority of federal courts hold that reliance on a lawyer's advice isn't a defense to criminal contempt. The Godfather's Vito Corleone didn't get to break the law with impunity because Tom Hagen told him it was OK.  Fourth, even if good faith reliance on a lawyer's advice were a defense, it wouldn't help Bannon. A person who wants to invoke a legitimate privilege in good faith doesn't simply ignore a subpoena. He responds on time, and he negotiates. He turns over all relevant documents that aren't covered by the privilege, and produces a privilege log indicating which documents he isn't turning over and why. He doesn't simply skip out on a scheduled deposition. He shows up, answers when he can, and invokes the privilege on a question-by-question basis.  Even with an executive privilege claim, the committee could plausibly pose questions that bear no connection to Trump, such as communications Bannon had with others outside the administration who were in a pre-insurrection ""war room"" at the Willard Hotel in DC.  Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department lawyer who apparently collaborated with Trump in trying to overturn the election results, also sought to invoke the privilege -- but he at least showed up at his deposition to do it.  Bannon didn't, and he didn't negotiate either. He appears not to have even tried to act in good faith. It looks like he holds Congress in abundant contempt. Now it's officially mutual.  Fifth, and finally, with no facts or law on his side, Schoen has resorted to claiming that Congress and the DOJ are just being unfair to his client. That's not going to cut it as a defense -- try winning a selective prosecution defense -- but it's also wrong on the facts.  Bannon's own words have been even more damaging than his lawyer's. When he surrendered himself to the FBI on Monday, Bannon brazenly outlined his intent, ""I don't want anybody to take their eye off the ball...We're taking down the Biden regime.""  Willfulness -- an informed and deliberate refusal to comply -- is required to prove criminal contempt. Look for the tape of those words to be played at trial to show bad intent.  Judge Carl Nichols may be a Trump appointee, but it's hard to conceive that he would look kindly on Bannon's brazenness. Proof of that is his scathing decision against Trump's allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, rejecting their effort to get Dominion Voting Systems' libel case against them thrown out. It's true that criminal contempt prosecutions are rare. They should be. They're a big deal. But Bannon's flagrant contempt of Congress cries out for consequences. And our republic needs them.  We are still looking for answers about what happened on January 6 and how to stop the ongoing attack waged by Bannon and his co-conspirators on the very idea of a democratic government. ",0
35," (CNN)Right now, federal agencies are negotiating a possible settlement with migrant families that could provide compensation for separating children from their parents in 2018 under the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy. And conservatives are not having it.Since The Wall Street Journal reported last month that settlements with the families could reach $450,000 per person, and the total buyout could be $1 billion or more, Republican lawmakers have been in an uproar. On Fox News, former Vice President Mike Pence blasted such a plan as ""totally unacceptable,"" while Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama condemned the idea as ""abhorrent and borderline evil.""   Between 2017 and 2018, about 5,600 families were separated under the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of some of the families in 2019, alleging constitutional and civil rights violations. It is these negotiations that are ongoing.  Whatever the final amount, the victims of family separations deserve compensation. Both policy and historical precedent support paying a financial settlement to those affected by the horrific practice. It is the right thing to do for the migrant families who will suffer the consequences of the separations for the rest of their lives.  Certainly, the victims of family separations suffered immense trauma. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that such separations were ""child abuse,"" while Physicians for Human Rights called it ""torture."" Children were detained in punitive conditions, often thousands of miles from their parents. Some children, alone in government care or in foster homes, allegedly experienced physical and sexual abuse.   These outcomes were known to the administration. Trump even said the family separations were intended to serve as a deterrent for unauthorized migration. A former deputy director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement told a Senate committee that he warned officials about the devastating consequences of family separations, but the Trump administration went ahead with the policy anyway.  Providing these families with compensation would be a public acknowledgment that the US government harmed them. The money would enable families to access the health and psychological care that they and their children will need in the years ahead. It would serve as a warning to future administrations that such a policy should never be pursued again.  The government has provided reparations to certain groups in the past. In 1988, Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act, which paid out $20,000 to Japanese Americans interned in the camps during World War II. The government also paid out moneys to members of Alaska's Aleut community, who were forcibly relocated during the same war. Similar actions have occurred at the local level, too. In 1994, Florida approved over $2 million settlement for Black victims of a 1923 racial massacre, while, in 2016, Chicago paid more than $5 million to police torture victims.  One difference in these cases is that restitution was made decades after the harm was inflicted, meaning that some victims never lived to receive settlements. With family separation victims, the government can act now, when compensation can make the most difference in migrant families' lives.  President Joe Biden has sent mixed messages about settlements for migrant families. He called reports of the $450,000 proposal ""garbage"" and said, ""That's not going to happen."" A White House spokesperson later walked back his comments, saying the President would be ""perfectly comfortable"" with a settlement for a lower amount. But that shouldn't be Biden's decision to make. The settlements are being negotiated by the ACLU and the federal agencies. The President should respect their expertise and let the negotiations proceed without inserting himself into them.   Of course, conservative media has seized on this issue, claiming that the US is rewarding ""illegal immigrants"" for coming to this country without authorization. Yet any reparations for migrants would be due to the fact that the US government separated parents and children. These migrants were refugees and asylum-seekers, exercising their legal rights to humanitarian relief. And consider that no amount of money can undo the pain and suffering these families went through, or give parents back the time they lost with their children. If conservatives are outraged by such payouts of taxpayer money, they should be angry at the administration that committed these abuses, not its victims.   As Americans prepare to gather for the holidays, it is worth reflecting on the value of family, regardless of immigration status. Vulnerable parents and children were harmed by the previous administration, and the government now has the opportunity to make restitution. Migrants deserve economic compensation for the horror of family separations.   ",0
36," (CNN)The House vote to censure Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona was the only appropriate thing for members of Congress to do. It signaled that violence and misogyny have no place in our politics -- and neither do politicians like Gosar who promote them. While all 221 House Democrats voted for censure, they were joined by only two of their Republican colleagues.What prompted the vote was Gosar's tweet of a photoshopped anime video showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and attacking the President of the United States with swords. Gosar has since taken the video down. He said he does not ""espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden"" and called the video ""truly a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy.""The resolution also removed Gosar from two committees -- including the Committee on Oversight and Reform, where he works with Ocasio-Cortez. Gosar's video was straight out of former President Donald Trump's playbook, which we've learned had a toxic effect. In his book ""Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It,"" Helio Fred Garcia found that after Trump verbally attacked groups -- including Hispanics and Muslims -- hate crimes against them increased.It is especially chilling that Gosar would tweet such a video in a year in which we have already seen online extremism spill over into deadly violence at the Capitol. On the heels of these events, Gosar's video will serve as a Trump-like nod to his supporters to take matters into their own hands when they disagree with the politics of certain politicians.Gosar's singling out of Ocasio-Cortez in the video is especially alarming. Congresswomen are already the targets of a disproportionate amount of online abuse. A 2020 study of congressional candidates found that women received two to three times more abusive online messages than their male counterparts. Women from ethnic minority backgrounds, like Ocasio-Cortez, contended with the most abuse on social media. And we've seen this kind of misogyny against female lawmakers turn into efforts at physical violence recently as well. Just last year, six people were charged in federal court for conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. One man has pleaded guilty to the charge, and five have pleaded not guilty. A trial is scheduled for some time in early 2022. She, too, had been singled out for disparagement by Trump. After a crowd chanted ""lock her up"" at a Trump rally last year, Whitmer's then-deputy digital director, Tori Saylor, tweeted that ""every single time the President does this at a rally, the violent rhetoric towards her immediately escalates on social media."" Jeopardizing the safety of our lawmakers threatens the democratic system created by America's founders more than two centuries ago. If members of Congress and the president of the United States cannot safely do their jobs, they cannot represent their constituents -- and the structure of our government becomes unstable. That's why every American should be outraged that anyone -- let alone a sitting member of Congress, from whom we expect respect for his own office -- would share a video like this.Gosar's tweet could be especially harmful to women, discouraging them from running for political office. We all know that there are misogynists online. But if women contemplating political careers also have to consider the prospect that a male colleague might implicitly call for violence against them -- and that they might even be expected to continue working directly with such a man -- I am fairly confident that fewer women will throw their hats in the ring. That's especially unfortunate for Gosar's party. Of the 435 members of the House of Representatives, only 31 of them are Republican women (89 are Democratic women). At a time when we really need to see these numbers increase to ensure that women's priorities and perspectives are represented in the lawmaking process, it's unconscionable that Gosar would do anything that discourages women from serving their country. That's why Gosar should be facing particular wrath from the women of his own party right now. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming has said it's ""indefensible"" that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has not fully condemned Gosar. McCarthy said he called Gosar about the tweet, but McCarthy didn't specifically denounce it. He also claimed that Democrats haven't held their own party members to the same standards and said that if Republicans retake the majority in the midterm, they may take similar action against certain Democrats.Given McCarthy's stance, it is no surprise that Congress did not meet Gosar's promotion of violence and misogyny with a unanimous, resounding rebuke. However, our country cannot function if lawmakers cannot safely do their jobs. Those who endorse such a system -- implicitly or otherwise -- have no place in elected office.",0
37," (CNN)Construction has been halted on a secret development inside of a Chinese shipping port near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates after intense US pressure, at least for now, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN -- but multiple officials cautioned that the security concerns over the Chinese presence in the country are far from resolved.The port project has been the focus of a flurry of diplomatic engagements in recent months by senior US officials and prominent lawmakers on Capitol Hill and has potentially jeopardized the sale of advanced American jet fighters and other advanced munitions to the UAE. ""Last we checked, we had successfully convinced the Emiratis to shut down the project,"" said one source familiar with the intelligence. ""But it's still a live issue.""The Wall Street Journal first reported that construction on the facility had been halted. US officials for at least a year have been closely watching the construction of what they believed was a military facility inside the commercial Khalifa port, about 50 miles from the UAE capital. The United States considers the UAE a key partner in counterterrorism efforts in the region and has thousands of troops based at an Emirati air base 20 miles outside of Abu Dhabi. Although China -- and the UAE -- portrayed the port venture as purely commercial, US intelligence has observed ships disguised as commercial vessels that officials recognized as a type typically used by the Chinese military for signals intelligence collection entering the port, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence.Officials remain divided over how much the UAE knew about China's intentions. A spokesman for the UAE Embassy in Washington said in a statement that the UAE ""never had an agreement, plan, talks or intention to host a Chinese military base or outpost of any kind."" The US National Security Council declined to comment. The Chinese Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.China developing ports around the worldChina has sought to develop commercial ports in outposts around the world in what US officials see as a clear effort to develop a foothold for military access. China has developed commercial ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as well as built its first overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017. Both the Trump administration and the Biden administration have sought to pressure the UAE to put a stop to the project at the port, which is run by a Chinese shipping conglomerate. Senior US lawmakers also addressed the port project with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, during a visit to the region in June. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a tweet that he had discussed ""our mutual concern regarding Chinese military activities in the Middle East"" with bin Zayed. Even though construction on the secretive development inside the port has now apparently been stopped, current and former officials say the broader Chinese presence in the country still may endanger the planned $23 billion sale of F-35 jets, Reaper drones and other advanced munitions, two sources familiar with the matter explained. ""The F-35 is our crown jewel. We need to be able to protect technology and security for all of our partners,"" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mira Resnick told CNN earlier this week. ""Those are the conversations we are having with Emiratis about what kind of choices they can make now, to make sure they can be part of the F-35 program.""Still, that the Biden administration was able to stop the facility from being built represents a key diplomatic victory in its efforts to compete with China on the international stage, current and former officials say. They point to leverage created by both negotiations on the F-35 -- which may now ease forward -- and the signing of the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and some Gulf nations, including the UAE, under President Donald Trump. ""I am thrilled with this development today,"" Inhofe wrote. ""I look forward to making sure the Biden admin continues productive conversations w/ our Emirati friends about advancing the F-35 sale, which would build our long-term relationship.""On Tuesday, Resnick told reporters in a briefing that the United States remains the ""partner of choice of all our allies in the region.""  ""None of the strategic competitors are able, they're not capable or willing to offer what the United States offers. So our partners and allies are well aware of that, and that is why they consistently choose the United States,"" she said.",0
38," (CNN)Austria is going back into a national lockdown and plans to become the first country in Europe to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for all eligible people as the nation's coronavirus crisis deepens, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg announced Friday.Schallenberg said his government would look to impose the national vaccine requirement from February 1. Just under 66% of Austria's total population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lower rates in the European Union, where cases are surging.The national lockdown -- the first in Europe this fall -- starts Monday and will last for 10 days minimum, and could be extended for a further 10 days, Schallenberg told reporters at a news conference in Vienna.""We don't want a fifth wave. We don't want a sixth and seventh wave. We don't want to have this discussion next summer,"" Schallenberg said.The move comes only days after Austria took the step, unprecedented in Europe, of imposing lockdown measures for all those age 12 and older who are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Under those measures, which came into force on November 15, the unvaccinated were ordered to stay at home except for a few limited reasons, with the rules policed by officers carrying out spot checks on those who were out and about.Vaccinations are currently recommended for everyone aged 12 and above in Austria. On Monday, a pilot scheme to vaccinate children aged five to 11 got under way in Vienna, the national capital.Asked by CNN from what age the mandatory vaccination order would apply, the Austrian Chancellory said: ""Details are still to come, from what age and when you are considered fully vaccinated.""Austrian Health Minister Wolfgang Mückstein said Friday that schools and kindergartens would remain open during the upcoming national lockdown.But Schallenberg said it was possible for parents to take their children out of school if they so wished. ""This is always a challenge, for every family,"" he said. During the first Austrian lockdown, schools and kindergartens were closed.Mückstein also urged the wearing of FFP2 masks in all enclosed spaces and said employees could request the option of working from home where possible.Once the national lockdown is lifted, lockdown measures will remain in place for unvaccinated Austrians, Mückstein said, adding that everything needed to be done to avoid a ""fifth wave.""Schallenberg had harsh words for anti-vaccination activists as he addressed the news conference Friday, saying they had acted irresponsibly.""We have too many political forces in this country that are fighting against this [vaccination] vehemently, massively and publicly. That is irresponsible. This is actually an attack on our health care system,"" he said. ""And incited by these radical opponents of vaccination, by specious fake news, unfortunately too many of us have not been vaccinated. The consequence is overcrowded intensive care units and enormous human suffering.""Once it goes into effect in February, Austria's Covid-19 vaccination mandate will be the most stringent measure to control the coronavirus through vaccination yet seen in Europe.In Italy, all workers are required to have a ""green pass"" -- a health certificate that shows proof of either full vaccination, recent recovery from infection or a negative test within the previous 48 hours -- or risk a fine and suspension without pay. People must also show their ""green pass"" to enter public places like theaters and cinemas.However, only health care workers are required to be vaccinated.Italy's government has credited the ""green pass"" strategy with boosting vaccination rates.Neighboring Germany also announced plans Thursday to introduce targeted Covid-19 restrictions on the unvaccinated in order to tackle record levels of infections amid its fourth wave of the pandemic. Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel described the country's Covid-19 situation as ''dramatic'' and ''very worrying"" at a news conference Thursday, following a meeting with Germany's 16 federal state leaders on stricter Covid-19 measures.Merkel warned that intensive care unit beds were filling up much too quickly, adding it was ''high time to take action.""Speaking Friday at a news conference in Berlin, acting Health Minister Jens Spahn described Germany as being ""in a national emergency,"" adding ""we will not break this wave with vaccinations alone.""Asked about the possibility of a lockdown for everyone, Spahn told reporters ''we are in a situation where we cannot rule anything out.""Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's disease and control center, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), told reporters the country had never seen such high rates of infection as now in the whole of the pandemic.For a twelfth day in a row, Germany has reported record new Covid-19 cases. The RKI on Friday reported 52,970 new cases within the past 24 hours. More than 98,000 people have died as a result of coronavirus in Germany, according to RKI data.The country's current daily death rate stands between 200 and 300, Wieler said. However, due to Germany's record level of infections over the past 12 days, ""the death rate is likely to increase over the coming days,"" he said.France is also experiencing a rise in Covid-19 infection rates, but French President Emmanuel Macron has said a lockdown of the unvaccinated is ""not necessary"" given the country's Covid-19 strategy.""The countries who are locking down the unvaccinated are those who don't have the 'health pass' in place,"" Macron said, in an interview with French newspaper La Voix du Nord published late Thursday.France's ""health pass"" confirms the bearer's vaccination status or proof of a negative Covid test and has governed access to a wide variety of establishments in France since its introduction in July.Ireland, which has one of Europe's highest vaccination rates, with 89.1% of people over the age of 12 having been immunized, imposed a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs from Thursday as the country faces a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections.",0
39,"London (CNN Business)The threat by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to quit China after one of its stars, Peng Shuai, disappeared from public view, leaves at least two global brands watching anxiously to see how this will play out.Peng, a two-time former Grand Slam doubles champion, has vanished from the public eye since she accused former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex in a social media post on November 2 that was deleted within minutes. Concerns for her safety have grown after Chinese state media released a screenshot of an email, purportedly from Peng and sent to the WTA, walking back her allegations and claiming ""everything is fine.""In an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, WTA chief executive Steve Simon said the welfare of the player and the need for her allegations to be properly investigated were ""bigger than the business"" that the WTA has in China. ""We're definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it,"" Simon said.Two of the WTA's official partners — Porsche, owned by Volkswagen (VLKAF), and German software maker SAP (SAP) — may feel differently about putting their own business in the world's second biggest economy at risk by backing the association's stance on Peng.CNN Business has contacted both companies for comment. Neither has so far responded.The silence from the WTA's corporate partners contrasts with growing calls for China to conduct a full and transparent investigation into her allegations. The United Nations Human Rights office on Friday urged Beijing to provide proof of her wellbeing, and the German Olympic Sport Federation made a similar call.Whether the WTA will follow through on Simon's threat to pull the WTA out of China is unclear. But for now, its sponsors are ""caught in the middle,"" said Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute in London.""If they appear to back the WTA, the Chinese Communist Party and China will punish them in the Chinese market. If they don't, women in democracies may boycott their products,"" he told CNN Business.Porsche has been in China for more than 20 years, according to the company. In August, the luxury sports car brand said it would build a permanent research and development center in Shanghai to improve local Chinese product development, ""allowing a sustained focus on what is Porsche's biggest single market."" Porsche executive board chairman Oliver Blume said at the time: ""Having a permanent home for this work in China will bring obvious benefits, particularly when it comes to reflecting and predicting our customers' needs in China — a nation that has truly welcomed Porsche and taken our cars to heart to the extent that it's been our biggest sales market for six consecutive years."" SAP is also committed to China as part of its global sales strategy, with six corporate locations and five software labs in the country. Whoop, the fitness tracker maker, is also a WTA partner. CNN Business has contacted Whoop for comment.— Anna Cooban, Teele Rebane and Michelle Toh contributed to this story.",0
40,"London (CNN Business)When Germany announced this week that it had suspended the process of certifying a controversial new Russian gas pipeline called Nord Stream 2, the response in energy markets was immediate.European natural gas futures finished almost 18% higher on Tuesday and rose again on Wednesday. UK wholesale prices also surged. They're now heading back towards record levels seen in early October, when some factories in Europe and the United Kingdom were shuttered because their operations had become unprofitable. The unease reflects a growing uncertainty: As colder weather sets in, will the region be able to source the energy it needs to power buildings and businesses and heat homes amid a global scramble for fuel?""Markets are incredibly jittery,"" said Nikos Tsafos, an expert in energy and geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington D.C. ""The lack of certification adds to that anxiety.""Germany's decision not to approve Nord Stream 2 for now because the pipeline operator is based in Switzerland appears to be based on a legal technicality. But the move will delay the date when gas is expected to start flowing — a turning point analysts have said could mitigate Europe's energy shortfalls.""The timeline for the start of the pipe now appears longer than what we initially expected,"" strategists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note.They now predict gas will start flowing along the pipeline in February of 2022, though some analysts think it will be even later. That means it can't be counted on to boost supply in the coming months, a period that was already going to be challenging.""Nord Stream 2 is the pipeline that can change the supply game in Europe and tip the scale, so delays in its utilization mean the current tight gas market conditions will persist through the winter,"" said Carlos Torres Diaz, head of gas and power markets at Rystad Energy.The importance of Nord Stream 2The European Union gets about 40% of its imported natural gas from Russia, and even as it transitions to cleaner sources of energy, that dependence is expected to remain intact.Construction of Nord Stream 2 by Gazprom, which is controlled by the Russian state, began in 2018 and was completed in September. It's set to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year directly from Russia to Europe. The pipeline has always been controversial because it bypasses Ukraine, causing countries like the United States to warn it will boost Moscow's influence in the region. But there had been speculation that the approval process for operations to begin could be sped up as natural gas prices in Europe rocketed higher due to weather patterns and a surge in demand as lockdowns were lifted. ""We haven't got enough gas at the moment, quite frankly. We're not storing for the winter period,"" Jeremy Weir, CEO of energy trading company Trafigura, told a conference organized by the Financial Times this week. ""So hence there is a real concern that ... if we have a cold winter that we could have rolling blackouts in Europe.""Tsafos of CSIS said there was never much clarity on whether gas from Nord Stream 2 could really ease the situation in the coming months. But the certification delay adds to concerns that Russia won't step up beyond its contractual obligations to supply gas to Europe at a difficult moment, as some had hoped.""We're in a slightly more distrusting environment with what's coming out of Russia this winter,"" Tsafos said.Henning Gloystein of Eurasia Group said that the amount of gas coming to Europe from Russia this winter shouldn't be impacted, but acknowledged that the situation remains politically fraught. ""By suspending the Nord Stream 2 approval process, German regulators and likely also its incoming new government signal they are not willing to bow to Russian pressure to fast-track approval for the pipeline,"" he said. ""It also signals [to] its allies in Poland, Brussels and in Washington that Berlin is not deaf to their criticism of the pipeline.""What's next?The development further clouds the outlook for Europe in the near term.Experts, anti-poverty organizations and environmental campaigners have warned that millions of people across Europe may not be able to afford to heat their homes this winter because of the leap in gas and electricity prices.Recent research led by Stefan Bouzarovski, professor at the University of Manchester and chair of energy poverty research network Engager, found that as many as 80 million households across Europe were already struggling to keep their homes adequately warm before the pandemic. The current price spike could make matters worse, though governments have taken steps to offset higher costs or put a cap on bill increases.Rystad Energy predicts that Nord Stream 2 delays could even impact the energy market beyond this winter, predicting that certification will now be completed around April at the earliest. Eurasia Group also thinks operations likely won't start until the second quarter of 2022.That would prolong the scramble for liquified natural gas, which is currently in extremely high demand.""Europe may be forced to continue being dependent on an already tight liquefied natural gas market, which suggests an increased likelihood of a sustained high price environment throughout much of next year's first half if Europe emerges with severely depleted storage,"" Rystad Energy said.",0
41," (CNN Business)A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.In the words of Committee to Protect Journalists executive director Joel Simon, ""To practice journalism in the face of grave danger requires a profound sense of optimism and a sincere faith in humanity.""Those qualities were on display Thursday night at the group's International Press Freedom Awards ceremony in New York. Journalists from Guatemala, Mozambique, Myanmar, and other countries were recognized for their courageous work. The honorees did not travel to the US, owing to Covid-era concerns and uncertainty, but the fund-raising gala was back in-person, supplemented by an online streaming option.You should read all about the CPJ honorees here. The quote that stuck with me most was from Matías Guente, executive editor of Canal de Moçambique and CanalMoz. His newsroom was gutted by an arson attack in August 2020. He was also pursued by local officials, harassed, and intimidated in recent years. ""They can burn the newsrooms down,"" he said, ""but they can't burn thoughts down. The threat of fire only increases what these arsonists fear most, the critical spirit.""From my perspective, this annual event always reinforces the privileges of working in a flawed but ferociously free news environment like the US -- a stark contrast to many other parts of the globe. Simon, who is stepping down from CPJ at year's end after a tremendous 15-year run, said Thursday night, ""I have always believed, and continue to believe, that a free society and a free people require a free press. People everywhere in the world deserve this.

Lai, the Apple Daily newspaper owner and pro-democracy media mogul, has been behind bars for nearly a year. CPJ reiterated on Thursday that Lai should be released immediately and that all the charges against him should be dropped...An ""increasingly repressive world""The evening's host, ABC's ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir, opened by making this point:""On the face of it, the job of a journalist is simple: to gather and then report the news. But for many reporters in today's increasingly repressive world, the very act of asking questions can be a crime. During the Covid pandemic, reporters have been jailed and intimidated just for collecting data on the numbers of infections and hospitalizations. Many governments have not been truthful about their failure to tackle the disease. Some have used the cover of Covid to stifle political dissent. Journalists looking to cut through that propaganda and misinformation of course pose a threat to those who are trying to control the message. And those journalists are at constant risk of being silenced.""",0
42,"London (CNN Business)The price of oil has shot up this fall, boosting profits for major producers but hurting the wallets of drivers who need to fill up their tanks. Just a few days back, gas prices in California hit their highest level ever. This week, however, some of the pressure has started to lift.A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.What's happening: West Texas Intermediate futures, the US benchmark for oil prices, and Brent futures, the global benchmark, are now trading at their lowest levels in six weeks on signals that supply constraints could begin to ease soon.In the United States, prices fell sharply Wednesday after oil inventories at a key hub in Cushing, Oklahoma rose for the first time in weeks.But Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at the consultancy Rystad Energy, told me that the biggest factor driving prices right now is the expected release of strategic reserves from the United States and China.According to the White House, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the ""importance of taking measures to address global energy supplies"" during their virtual summit this week. That sparked chatter about a coordinated move initiated by the White House to put millions of barrels of oil on the market.Thursday brought some signs that China is taking action. Reuters reported that the country's state reserve bureau said it was working on a release, though the exact details remain murky.A spokesperson for China's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration told CNN on Friday that it was ""pushing forward with crude oil release-related work at the moment,"" but declined to comment on whether it was in response to a US request to work together to tackle the supply crunch. Based on current price moves, Tonhaugen said, investors are expecting between 20 million and 30 million barrels to come online in the next month. That could be from the United States and China together, or through broader action coordinated by the International Energy Agency.He emphasized, however, that the release of strategic reserves won't change the overall picture for long.""[Releasing] strategic reserves is not the same as getting more continuous production of oil online,"" Tonhaugen said.But more lasting relief could be coming. The IEA said in a report this week that it expects global oil supplies to rise by 1.5 million barrels per day over November and December as some production in the United States picks up again.""The world oil market remains tight by all measures, but a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon,"" the Paris-based agency said.OPEC is also steadily ramping up output, but there are questions about whether supply gains will be enough to meet a surge in demand for fuel.Watch this space: President Joe Biden, who is taking political heat from the spike in gasoline prices, asked the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday to ""immediately"" investigate whether illegal activity by oil and gas companies is contributing to the problem.The American Petroleum Institute slammed the push and renewed its call for the federal government to encourage domestic oil and gas production even as it tries to fight the climate crisis.""This is a distraction from the fundamental shift that is taking place and the ill-advised government decisions that are exacerbating this challenging situation,"" the group said in a statement.Warren Buffett-backed Paytm stumbles in trading debutOne of the hottest companies to begin trading on India's stock market is getting off to a rough start.This just in: Paytm's stock launched in Mumbai on Thursday. Shares of the startup went live at $26 apiece, below the offer price. They finished down more than 27%, giving the firm a market value of under $14 billion.The weak debut reflects analysts' fears about the digital payments company, my CNN Business colleague Diksha Madhok reports. Despite its buzz, it lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year and seems far from ready to turn a profit. It's also up against competition from some of the biggest technology firms in the world.Its initial public offering still marks a milestone. The digital payments company raised $2.5 billion in its IPO — the largest ever in the country when measured in local currency.With backing from investors such as Warren Buffett, Masayoshi Son and Alibaba, Paytm is one of India's best funded startups. The company took off five years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned two of the country's biggest currency notes. The move was hugely disruptive for India's economy, but it helped Paytm grow at an explosive rate: The company signed 10 million new users within a month. Paytm now has 337 million registered consumers and 22 million merchants. Yet the field is getting crowded. Facebook and Google also want a piece of the huge market and have launched their own mobile payments systems in the country.The metaverse is bigger than just FacebookFacebook (FB) (ahem, Meta Platforms) isn't the only company planning to cash in on the metaverse.The latest: Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), the industry leader in graphics processors and AI chips, are up 9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the company reported record revenue and forecast better-than-expected earnings for its upcoming quarter.Nvidia recently announced the formal launch of NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for simulating and designing virtual worlds. The company has said it hopes to tap into the 40 million 3D designers in the global market. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg of what's to come,"" said CEO Jensen Huang.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) also wants in on the action, telling investors it intends to be ""the ticket to the metaverse."" Companies ranging from the owner of Playboy to record label Warner Music Group and media giant Disney all discussed the metaverse in earnings calls during the past few weeks, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica has noted.Then there's gaming platform Roblox, which lets users generate their own avatars and play games created by other players. Shares have soared almost 160% since they debuted on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney told CNN in Seoul that the metaverse isn't going to be created by one company. ""It will be created by millions of developers each building out their part of it,"" Sweeney said.Step back: Facebook made a splash when it changed its corporate name to Meta Platforms as it pivots its focus to augmented reality and virtual worlds. But if its vision of the future pans out, it won't be alone in raking in profits.Up nextAlibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD), Kohl's (KSS), Macy's (M) and Petco report results before US markets open. Ross Stores (ROST) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) follow after the close.Also today: Initial US jobless claims for last week post at 8:30 a.m. ET.Coming tomorrow: Foot Locker (FL) earnings wrap up retail's big week.",0
43,"Philadelphia (CNN)Earlier this week, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced that 70% of the city's adults had received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine -- reaching President Biden's goal for the nation ahead of schedule.Yet that doesn't tell the whole story. Only one-quarter of those vaccinations have gone to Black residents even though they make up more than 40% of the city's population.Throughout the pandemic, people of color have been devastated by Covid-19 in the US -- dying at a much greater rate than white Americans. Now, as deaths have fallen with increased vaccinations, those dying are younger and more disproportionately Black. Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change that. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods. ""We are intentional about focusing on communities that have the low vaccination rates and the highest positivity rates,"" said Stanford, whose organization has been praised as a model to reduce health care inequality by the CDC. ""Those who are most vulnerable ... they need to have the support.""It's an unlikely path for Stanford, a pediatric surgeon, but she's always defied expectations. Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, her family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep Stanford from dreaming big.""I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it,"" she said. ""That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what.""She became a surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down, so she hunkered down at home with her husband and three young sons.Early that April, she was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent white areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.  Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.""This was your working-class community. They were keeping the city and the country running,"" she said. ""But wherever Black people were, one thing that was tough to come by was testing."" So, she gathered up PPE from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.""The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started,"" she said. Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing. In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour ""Vax-A-Thon"" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people. The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers. In recent weeks, as the pace of vaccinations has slowed, the group found new ways to reach those in need. Their events now often include music, free refreshments, t-shirt giveaways and other incentives. More than 1,000 people have signed up for their home vaccination program and they've targeted teenagers with special events as well as high school visits to answer questions about the vaccine.The group is currently based at Deliverance Evangelistic Church in North Philadelphia. In the fall, they plan to open a health equity center there until they ultimately open their own permanent facility.Stanford's efforts have brought her such acclaim that she's now under consideration to be the city's next health commissioner. Laushae Hightower, 78, has become one of the group's unofficial ambassadors -- regularly bringing carloads of family and friends from his neighborhood.""Anybody that wants to come, I'll bring 'em,"" he said. ""My little bit of bringing them up here pales to what she's doing.""For Stanford, that support means that her efforts to earn the trust of the community have paid off.   ""Just seeing folks come out, day in and day out ... their presence says everything,"" Stanford said. ""This wasn't my job, but I could not allow one additional life to be lost when I knew that I could do something about it. "" CNN's Kathleen Toner spoke with Stanford about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What's the atmosphere like when you vaccinate people?Dr. Ala Stanford: Honestly, the atmosphere is joy. It's new beginnings. It's exhaling for a lot of people because they've finally done it. It's also emotional -- a lot of tears for folks because it takes them back to a person that they lost. We had a woman whose mother had died the night before from Covid. When she came up she was still sobbing and we just built a circle around her, held hands around her and let her cry. CNN: How have you dealt with people's fear or hesitation about getting vaccinated?Stanford: We tried to prepare for it. In the fall, we conducted a survey that gave us some insight into what would make people more comfortable taking the vaccine when it became available. Then in December, I got vaccinated. I'd had Covid, so I'd thought about not getting vaccinated because I knew I had antibodies, but I took on that responsibility because people were following my lead. Then, when we started vaccinating, we had one day where we ran out of vaccine, so I said to the city, ""This hesitancy in the Black community, we are not seeing it."" They were lined up.But there are people who have concerns -- understandably -- and it's not my job to persuade. It's my job to educate and allow you to make an informed decision about your health. So, I listen to what the reason is why they're not getting vaccinated -- sometimes it's lack of education, sometimes it's fear, sometimes they can't even tell you why. Sometimes the questions they have, there are no answers for. So, I just state the facts and I'm honest with them. But you're more likely statistically to die if you're African American and you contract coronavirus. That is a fact. Regardless of how much money you make or not, regardless of comorbid conditions or not. I tell them, ""You have to weigh the risks and benefits"" and I'm available to listen and answer. It's not a one-time conversation for some people. Some people need to come back and watch a couple of people get it. And then they're like, ""OK, Doc. I'm ready."" CNN: How did the idea for your new center come about?Stanford: The pandemic has made it glaringly obvious how we are missing the mark with health equity in the United States, so we're opening a multi-disciplinary clinic on October 1st where we can do family practice, pediatrics, phlebotomy and flu shots. Who knows -- we may need to do booster shoots for coronavirus. But this is answering the need of the community. People just started showing up to say, ""Hey Doc, could you look at my labs?"" or ""I've got this lump on my neck. Is this normal?""  So that's what's next for us. Our mission has always been about getting Black and brown communities the access and care they deserve.Want to get involved?

44," (CNN)These 10 people are making the world a better place and now, they have been named the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2021.They were all nominated by you -- our audience -- and selected by CNN to each receive a $10,000 prize. And now you can vote on who you think should be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause.To find out who is named Hero of the Year, you'll have to watch ""The 15th Annual CNN Heroes All-Star Tribute,"" hosted by Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa on Sunday, December 12, starting at 8 p.m. ET. CNN Heroes has been spotlighting the impactful work of people across the world since 2007. Here's a look at this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes:Jenifer Colpas: Bringing clean water and power to rural villages in her countryHer cause: Jenifer Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata in 2015, a non-profit that provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. Colpas and her team currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people.What inspired her: Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door. After college, she moved to India for a job in information technology. There, she became aware of vast social inequalities.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said. She decided to change her career path and return home, where she co-founded Tierra Grata, which means ""gratitude to the earth"" in Spanish.Read more about Jenifer Colpas and her workLynda Doughty: The seal rescuerHer cause:  For the past decade, Lynda Doughty's nonprofit, Marine Mammals of Maine, has provided response efforts, assistance and medical care for more than 3,000 marine animals.The group monitors 2,500 miles of coastline and operates a 24-hour hotline, responding to calls about distressed or deceased marine mammals, and it has federal authorization to provide temporary care for critically ill and injured seals. Data gathered on these animals allows Doughty and her team to monitor trends in diseases and human impact on marine mammal health.What inspired her:  Growing up in coastal Maine, Doughty developed a passion for the marine wildlife living along the coast and knew from an early age that she wanted to dedicate her life to protecting them.""I just remember being so amazed (by them) and wondering what's happening in their life,"" Doughty said.She also became aware that their livelihood was jeopardized by pollution, habitat destruction and other human-related activity.""I knew that I wanted to do something to help these animals,"" Doughty said.She became a marine biologist and worked for several years with organizations that provided emergency response and rehabilitation for sick and injured marine mammals. But as nonprofits and state agencies lost funding or closed their doors, Doughty decided to step in and fill the gap.Read more about Lynda Doughty and her workDavid Flink: Creating a new way to learnHis cause:  David Flink's Eye to Eye program pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference. Eye to Eye's 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school.What inspired him: Growing up, Flink had a hard time focusing in school, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. With the support of his parents and the right school, Flink graduated high school and went to Brown University.When he got to college, he found a community of students who also had learning differences. Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability.Read more about David Flink and his workDr. Patricia Gordon: Saving women from a preventable diseaseHer cause: Dr. Patricia Gordon operates CureCervicalCancer, which delivers screening, training and supplies to clinics around the world. The organization has since worked in 10 countries, including China, Haiti, Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Vietnam.The non-profit has screened more than 150,000 women and treated more than 8,600 to date. It has also established 106 sustainable clinics to screen and treat women in remote and underserved areas.""That there are 8,000 women who are alive and well and able to provide for their families is honestly the most rewarding thing that I could have ever imagined in my life,"" Gordon said. ""I think I'm the luckiest doctor that ever lived.""What inspired her: Gordon, a radiation oncologist, traveled with a group of doctors in 2012 to bring a new radiation device to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. While there, she saw how many women were needlessly being killed by a preventable, treatable disease: cervical cancer.""There are 350,000 women dying a painful, undignified death globally. And it's almost 100% preventable,"" she said.The team arranged to provide cervical cancer screenings for women in a remote and hard-hit area of Senegal. Using a method Gordon and others call ""See & Treat,"" screening can be done without needing electricity and with a few transportable supplies.It was a far cry from the way things operated in her Beverly Hills office, but the experience stayed with Gordon, whose own family history of breast cancer is a driving force in her work.After 27 years, Gordon left her private practice in 2014 to devote all her time to CureCervicalCancer. She takes no salary.Read more about Dr. Patricia Gordon and her workHector Guadalupe: Giving former prisoners a second chanceHis cause: Hector Guadalupe's non-profit, A Second U Foundation, helps formerly incarcerated men and women get certified as personal trainers and build careers in the fitness industry so they can support their families. Guadalupe and his team of volunteers offer a free eight-week program for 10-15 students every quarter to prepare for the national certification exam.In addition to study materials and exam fees, the program now also provides each student a free tablet with keyboard, transportation, new clothing, software classes and a $1,300 stipend. Coaches also mentor students, helping with far more than classwork.Once students have passed the exam, Guadalupe helps them get jobs. More than 200 people have graduated from the program since 2016 and only two have reoffended -- a recidivism rate of less than 1%.  What inspired him: By the time he was a teenager, Guadalupe had lost both parents and ended up spending 10 years in prison for drug trafficking. There he became obsessed with fitness and got certified as a personal trainer. When he came home, he was determined to work at one of Manhattan's elite gyms.""Six days out of the week, I'm literally at every corporate health club ... filling out applications,"" Guadalupe said. ""Nobody was calling me back ... and I knew why: because of my past ... But I didn't give up.""After nine months, he landed an opportunity and worked without a day off for four years to establish himself in New York's fitness scene. Now, he devotes much of his week to helping others do the same.Read more about Hector Guadalupe and his workMichele Neff Hernandez: Finding a way through grief togetherHer cause: Michele Neff Hernandez created Soaring Spirits in 2008, three years after her husband's death. Her nonprofit connects widows and widowers, allowing them to heal in a community that understands the pain of losing a partner. It has grown to include 70 regional chapters all over the US, as well as pen pals and programs specifically for the LGBTQ community.To date, the organization has reached more than 4 million people worldwide.""It's about helping widowed people live life in community with each other, so that someone who has borne witness to their pain also bears witness to their life as they continue making their way forward,"" Neff Hernandez said.What inspired her: Hernandez and her husband, Phillip, were enjoying the active life they built as a couple. But everything changed in August 2005 when Phillip went for a bike ride and was hit by a car and killed.""I didn't even know what to do with myself,"" Neff Hernandez said. ""Every single thing about my life changed.""While she had a great support system, none of their friends and family knew how to handle her grief.Hernandez realized she wanted to connect with other widows to learn how they dealt with their new reality.""I thought if I could bring these widows together, what a difference that would make,"" she said.Read more about Michelle Neff Hernandez and her workZannah Mustapha: Building a strong and peaceful future generation His cause: For more than a decade, Zannah Mustapha has devoted his life to providing hope and peace for children in northern Nigeria caught in the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. He and his staff educate more than 2,000 students from both sides of the conflict at the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School.The school offers psychological and social support to help children with trauma. Students, who all live nearby with relatives or family members, are also provided uniforms, books, meals and health services.Mustapha said 1,023 students have graduated, and many have gone on to college or careers.""These are children (who are) ravaged by the disturbances that Boko Haram has brought in,"" he said. ""Children ... are not even having this war.""What inspired him: Mustapha said he believes the way to achieve true and lasting peace in the devastated region is through education, and he has defied all odds to keep the doors to his three schools open.He started the program in 2007 with 36 orphans and expanded, even as others fled the region. As Mustapha continued to expand to meet the needs of children, he saw more and more women struggling when their husbands were killed in the conflict. So, he developed a program in which women could learn a trade to help support their families.A peace leader, Mustapha envisions a Nigeria where there is no more violence, where education and acceptance are encouraged for all.""(When I) see the faces of these children and how these children are dreaming, it gives me the hope that still there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""Read more about Zannah Mustapha and his workShirley Raines: Beauty 2 the StreetzHer cause:  For the past six years, Raines and her organization, Beauty 2 the Streetz, have been a mainstay on Los Angeles' Skid Row, providing food, clothing, hair and makeup services -- and most recently health and hygiene items -- to thousands of people.Rain or shine, she sets up ""shop"" weekly at the corner of 5th and Townes to serve those she calls ""Kings"" and ""Queens."" Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to downtown LA to feed and bring supplies to people.What inspired her: Raines' 2-year-old son Demetrius was staying with her grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized.He died on Sept. 6, 1990, just shy of his third birthday.""I blamed myself for not having stability. If only I'd had my own backyard. If only I'd had my stuff together,"" Raines said.  Soon after, Raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son's biological father to cancer.""I just fell apart. I lived a very unhappy life. I couldn't keep anything together,"" she said.After struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades, Raines' twin sister stepped in, urging her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,'"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Read more about Shirley Raines and her workDr. Ala Stanford: Bringing Covid-19 testing and vaccines to Philly's minority neighborhoodsHer cause: Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods.Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing.In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour ""Vax-A-Thon"" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people.The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers.What inspired her:  Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, Stanford's family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep her from dreaming big.""I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it,"" she said. ""That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what.""She became a pediatric surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.She was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia as a result of Covid-19. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent White areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.So, she gathered up protective supplies from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.""The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started,"" she said.Read more about Dr. Ala Stanford and her workMade Janur Yasa: A plastic clean-up program that's feeding familiesHis cause: Made Janur Yasa's non-profit, Plastic Exchange, allows local villagers in Bali, Indonesia, to exchange plastic trash for rice, a main food staple. This barter system benefits the environment and empowers the local people.  In May 2020, he hosted the first exchange in the village where he was born and raised. It was a success, and the concept quickly spread to other villages across Bali.Villages hold community exchange events once a month in which residents can bring in plastic to trade in for rice. Yasa says the organization has so far helped feed thousands of families and collected nearly 300 tons of plastic for recycling.What inspired him: Yasa owns a vegan restaurant on Indonesia's island of Bali, where tourism is the driving economic force. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many residents lost their jobs.""I saw people in my village start worrying about how they were going to put food on the table,"" he said. ""This concerned me.""Yasa said he wanted to find a way to help people in his community during the pandemic while also addressing the ongoing problem of plastic pollution on Bali's beaches.""I got to thinking, inside the challenge there is an opportunity,"" he said.Read more about Made Janur Yasa and his work",0
45," (CNN)A significant storm system is forecast to bring powerful winds, which could mean disruptions at major airports Monday through Wednesday. It may not pack a hefty punch of precipitation. Still, the precipitation will be a nuisance and bring blustery winds more fit for Christmas travel than Thanksgiving travel.""Deepening low pressure should allow for a period of breezy/gusty winds across much of the East Monday and Tuesday and possibly into the middle and latter parts of the week across the Northeast as low pressure lingers offshore,"" the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) reported. The two most common airport delays are low ceilings -- low clouds -- and wind during the winter months.""The combination of airport surface winds and low ceiling and visibility conditions account for about 75 percent of delays,"" the Federal Aviation Administration explained.Along with the winds will come unseasonably cold temperatures, some snow, and rain early in the week. Another 'significant storm' is possible later in the week, the Weather Prediction Center noted.Here is a day-by-day breakdown of what to expect. SaturdayThis will by far be the best day to travel all week since the vast majority of precipitation will only happen in the intermountain West. Snow and rain showers will occur in areas of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and western Colorado.Some thunderstorms are also possible in southern Florida throughout the day. SundayThe storm system begins to take shape across the Midwest. Rain showers are possible in the region Sunday morning and then maybe even some snow showers in the evening. But the wind picking up could steal the show. ""Current indications suggest wind gusts could peak in the 35 to 40 mph range,"" the Chicago National Weather Service (NWS) said. Stay on top of the latest delays and the most recent forecast modelsThe wind combined with the cold could send the ""feel's like"" temperature down into the upper teens or single digits. ""A little farther east, a wintry mix could develop over the northern Mid-Atlantic Sunday morning,"" the WPC said Friday.Some light rain could creep into the Northeast Sunday evening ahead of the cold front. MondayThe exact timing of the rain is still uncertain, but it is likely from any time Sunday night to mid-afternoon Monday as the cold front sweeps through. The front will stretch from Florida to Maine through the morning hours. By midday, the front is off the coast and dry conditions will settle in for most. ""Moderate to heavy rainfall should continue into parts of New England though with the heaviest totals (in excess of an inch) across far northeast Maine on Monday,"" the WPC said in its forecast. Lake-effect snow is also possible on the east side of the Great Lakes. As of Friday afternoon, the low pressure expected to form along the coast will stay far enough offshore to prevent the major metro areas from seeing any increased precipitation. However, the storm system will intensify winds across the region leading into Tuesday.TuesdayThe coastal low will crank up the winds in the Northeast.  Northwest winds of 15 to 25 mph with gusts of 25 to 35 mph, with the strongest near the coast, are possible throughout the day, the New York NWS projected. The winds will impact flights across the region. And it won't just be the impact to the planes; anyone working on the ground outside will have to deal with extremely blustery conditions. ""In fact, Tuesday highs will most likely be in the 40s (20s in mountains) for most areas with lows in the 20s for most areas,"" the NWS in Washington, DC said. ""This will make it feel more like late December (normal high for December 25th is 47 degrees at DCA and 45 degrees at BWI).""Out in the Pacific Northwest, it may be slightly warmer. Still, another storm system will move in early Tuesday morning, bringing more rain to the saturated region.WednesdayNot much changes as the Pacific Northwest continues to see rainfall while gusty winds will continue in the Northeast.The storm in the Northeast may take its time exiting the region, leaving some gusty winds, rain and snow showers in New England. Models have trended on a quicker exit, but it is still too early to nail down timing. If you are skiing this holiday weekend, you are in luck as snow showers are possible for the Intermountain West. The snow may even dip down to the lower elevations, including Denver, Salt Lake City and Cheyenne, Wyoming.  A storm entering the Midwest will begin to ramp up and pull in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. This will produce an expanding area of moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern Texas into parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley. ThanksgivingModerate to heavy rain will continue Thanksgiving Day for much of the South from Texas to Tennessee with up to 2 inches possible in some locations. Temperatures rebound mostly back to normal by Thursday for much of the eastern half of the US, but keep in mind ""normal"" can still be cold.  For example, New York will likely see temperatures in the low 40s, so for anyone venturing out to watch the big morning parade, make sure you bundle up! Friday into the WeekendThe return trip could be dicey for some as the Midwest storm system continues to push east. The models do not agree on the intensity or timing of the storm. One computer weather model shows mainly rain across the Southeast. While the other brings rain, ice and snow into the Northeast. It will be certainly something meteorologists and travelers alike will keep their eyes on.",0
46," (CNN)The City of Aurora, Colorado, has agreed to pay $15 million to the family of Elijah McClain to settle the civil rights lawsuit filed against the city in the wake of the 23-year-old's violent arrest and subsequent death in 2019.The settlement was first announced in October but was finalized after a mediation hearing with McClain's family members in US District Court on Friday. The multi-million-dollar payout is the latest in a series of high-profile police misconduct settlements in which cities have paid millions of dollars to surviving family members. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the family of George Floyd received a $27 million settlement. In Louisville, Kentucky, the family of Breonna Taylor, who was shot dead in a police raid, received a $12 million payment.""No amount of money can change what happened or erase the pain and heartbreak experienced by the family over his loss,"" Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly said in a statement issued to CNN. ""The settlement is an important step in moving forward with the city's 'New Way' plan to restore the community's trust in public safety, while avoiding a protracted legal process that does not serve the best interests of the city or the family.""Aurora will pay $5 million of the settlement out of the city's general fund, while the other $10 million will be covered by the city's excess liability insurance policy. The Aurora City Council approved the $15 million at a meeting in July.In August 2019, McClain, 23, was stopped by police while walking home from a store, placed in a carotid choke hold and then injected with ketamine. His mother, Sheneen McClain, filed a federal lawsuit in 2020 against the City of Aurora and the police officers and fire department members involved in her son's death. Last month, her attorneys announced the case had been settled in principle, resolving all claims in the federal civil rights case. Attorneys for Sheneen McClain confirmed the $15 million figure to CNN and issued a statement: ""No amount of money will ever bring Elijah back to his mother. Ms. McClain would return every cent for just one more day with her son. There will be an allocation hearing in the near future to determine the distribution of the settlement between Ms. McClain, who raised Elijah as a single parent, and the biological father.""""Hopefully this sends a message to police everywhere that there are consequences for their actions,"" LaWayne Mosley, Elijah's father, said in a statement. ""I hope Elijah's legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person.""Spurred by protests in Aurora and a viral online petition, Gov. Jared Polis announced a reexamination of the case last year. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser was appointed as special prosecutor and opened a grand jury investigation into the case in January.In September, a Colorado grand jury indicted three police officers and two fire department paramedics involved in McClain's death. Each was indicted on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide as part of a 32-count indictment.  The Colorado Attorney General's Office launched a 14-month investigation into the Aurora police and fire departments. The investigation found the police department had a pattern of practicing racially biased policing and excessive force and had failed to record legally required information when interacting with the community. Earlier this week, the city and the state of Colorado reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree to resolve Aurora Police Department and Aurora Fire Rescue issues identified in a September ""Patterns and Practices"" report. The consent decree covers four areas identified in the Attorney General's report: Racially Biased Policing, Use of Force, Documentation of Stops, and Ketamine and Other Chemical Restraints.",0
47," (CNN)A defense attorney for one of the three men charged in Ahmaud Arbery's killing asked prosecutors for a plea deal and was declined, an attorney for Arbery's mother told CNN.""Prosecutors shared with"" Arbery's mother that defendant William ""Roddie"" Bryan Jr.'s lawyer ""asked for a plea deal before resting their case,"" and ""prosecutors declined any plea offer,"" Lee Merritt, an attorney the mother, said Friday. Reporters outside the southeastern Georgia court where the trial is being conducted asked Kevin Gough, Bryan's attorney, on Friday whether he asked prosecutors for a plea deal.""I don't know what y'all are talking about,"" Gough responded as he walked toward a courthouse entrance. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, confirmed to reporters outside the same courthouse Friday that she heard from the district attorney about the request for a deal.The district attorney's office that is prosecuting the case declined to comment about being approached about a plea deal. The claim about a plea deal request comes as defense attorneys are expected to begin closing arguments Monday after 10 days of court proceedings and testimony from more than 20 witnesses and investigators. The defense rested its case Thursday, and lawyers and the judge were working in court Friday on what instructions to give to the jury.  Three White men -- Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael and their neighbor Bryan Jr. -- face charges including malice murder and felony murder in the death of Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was chased by the trio on February 23, 2020, in the Satilla Shores neighborhood near Brunswick, Georgia.Arbery's family has said he was out for a jog when he was killed. Defense attorneys contend the McMichaels, suspecting him of burglary, were trying to conduct a lawful citizen's arrest, and that Bryan, after seeing the McMichaels chase Arbery, attempted to cut Arbery off, followed and recorded cell phone video of the pursuit and shooting. The younger McMichael testified he shot Arbery in self-defense as he and Arbery wrestled over McMichael's shotgun. All three defendants have pleaded not guilty. Defense lawyer's motion for mistrial rejectedOn Friday, Gough again filed for a mistrial, this time saying it was because of concerns over a ""demonstration"" that occurred outside the Brunswick courthouse Thursday.  ""This is an event that is literally, literally at the courthouse door with more people than I could count outside,"" Gough said.The defense attorney was referring to a ""Prayer Wall"" event Thursday afternoon, that was attended by a large group of pastors, clergy and other supporters of the Arbery family from across the country. State prosecutors accused him of orchestrating the demonstration with his complaints about the presence of nationally known African-American clergymen in the courtroom.""They're responding to what he strategically, knowingly, intelligently did so that there would be a response so that he could then complain of it,"" lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said. ""That is good lawyering right there, because now he's motioned for a mistrial based on something that he caused."" The judge rejected Gough's motion.Seemingly attempting to put distance between himself and Gough, Travis McMichael's attorney on Friday afternoon called the prayer event ""beautiful"" and ""powerful.""""There was passion, there was emotion, there was community support,"" attorney Jason Sheffield said. ""The community came together in a beautiful, powerful way on an issue that they felt very passionately about.""Closing arguments expected MondayThe trial has touched on a number of issues of national concern, from the role of race in the criminal justice system to how video evidence can spur action, the limits of self-defense rights and the consequences of using firearms on public streets.Supporters of Arbery have held prayer vigils and marches outside the courthouse in Brunswick, the seat of Glynn County. Charges were not filed against the defendants for months until Bryan's cell phone video emerged, sparking outrage and condemnation over the glacial progress of the case. The first two prosecutors recused themselves due to conflicts of interest, citing their proximity to Gregory McMichael during his career. Ultimately, prosecutors in Georgia's Cobb County -- more than 200 miles from where Arbery was killed -- were appointed to the case.Additional charges levied against the defendants include aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony. If convicted, each man could face life in prison without the possibility of parole.  All three men have also been indicted on federal hate crime and attempted kidnapping charges.  Prosecutors cite inconsistencies from Travis McMichael The McMichaels, according to their attorneys, suspected Arbery of burglary in part because they and several neighbors were concerned about people entering an under-construction home -- and because of Travis McMichaels' encounter with a man in the neighborhood on February 11, 2020, nearly two weeks before the shooting.According to testimony, the deadly pursuit started with this: A neighbor called police on the afternoon of February 23 to say a man later identified as Arbery was at the construction site alone. Arbery ran off as the man called police, the neighbor testified.Gregory McMichael, investigators testified, said he initiated the pursuit after seeing Arbery speedily run by McMichael's home, and that he believed Arbery matched the description of someone who had been recorded at the construction site before. The prosecution has said surveillance videos do show Arbery at the construction site multiple times, including the day he was killed, but always without breaking in and without taking anything.Prosecution witnesses also have testified that the McMichaels did not know for certain at the time of the chase that Arbery was at the site that day, or whether the man in the videos had ever taken anything from the construction site. The owner of the unfinished home, Larry English Jr., testified in a September deposition -- played for jurors last week -- that he ""probably"" had told the McMichaels about incidents on his property.  English said he never authorized the McMichaels to confront anybody on the construction site.Travis McMichael testified that on the day of the shooting, his father told him he saw ""the guy that has been breaking in down the road."" Jumping into their truck, Travis McMichael said they caught up to Arbery and tried talking to him twice, but that Arbery did not respond. Travis McMichael said he noticed another truck in the neighborhood. Prosecutors contend Bryan, the third defendant, got in his own truck and joined the pursuit, though he did not know what was going on, and struck Arbery with his vehicle.Eventually pulling ahead of Arbery down the road, McMichael testified, he parked his vehicle and exited, then pointed his shotgun at Arbery as he approached, telling him to stop. McMichael testified Arbery darted to him, grabbed the rifle and struck McMichael before he then shot Arbery. On Thursday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski challenged McMichael over what she said were inconsistencies in his accounts to authorities. That included not telling police initially that he and his father were trying to make a citizen's arrest, though that's what the defense has since contended. She also covered differences in his accounts on when and where he told Arbery certain things, such as to stop.McMichael responded he was ""scattered"" and ""mixed up"" in the hours after the shooting, because ""this is the most traumatic event I've ever been through in my life.""McMichael also acknowledged several times, under Dunikoski's questioning, that he never saw Arbery armed during the pursuit, never heard Arbery verbally threaten him and that Arbery never responded or showed any interest in conversing with McMichael as he tried to ask what he was doing.On Friday, Sheffield called his client ""brave' for choosing to testify, saying the younger McMichael was ""continuing to do his duty to the truth by telling his story, by subjecting himself to cross-examination.""He also suggested that health concerns may have played a role in the decision to not put Gregory McMichael on the stand.  Racial aspects have not gone unnoticedRace has been a noticeable factor surrounding the case, with three White men standing accused in the death of the Black jogger. In a county that has a 69% population of White residents and 26% Black, according to Census Bureau data, 11 of the 12 jurors are White. Satilla Shores, the neighborhood where the shooting took place, is just outside Brunswick city limits. About 55% of the 16,200 residents in Brunswick are Black, compared to 40% who are White, according to the Census data. Judge Timothy Walmsley said before opening statements he would allow the case to move forward, but he said the court ""has found that there appears to be intentional discrimination"" in the jury selection.Ben Crump, an attorney for Arbery's father, said Arbery had been ""denied justice"" and was highly critical of the jury makeup, adding, ""A jury should reflect the community,"" he said on November 4. Days prior, Gough complained that older White men from the South without four-year college degrees, ""euphemistically known as 'Bubba' or 'Joe Six Pack,'"" seemed to be underrepresented in the pool of potential jurors that had turned up.As testimony proceedings moved forward, Gough continuously decried the presence of Black pastors in the public gallery who were there to offer support for Arbery's family. Last Thursday, noting the attendance of the Rev. Al Sharpton during the trial, Gough said he had ""nothing personally against"" Sharpton, adding, ""We don't want any more Black pastors coming in here or other Jesse Jackson, whoever was in here earlier this week, sitting with the victim's family trying to influence a jury in this case."" Gough apologized for his remarks the next day. Walmsley stated throughout the case that as long as there were no disruptions from the gallery, no measures would be taken by the court regarding attendance. ",0
48," (CNN)The jury in the civil trial against the organizers of a two-day Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, finished their first day of deliberations without reaching a verdict. Judge Norman Moon sent the jury home and told them to come back Monday and be ready to start at 9 a.m.The Unite the Right rally was held on August 11 and 12 in 2017 to oppose the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. As the violence unfolded, it reached a tipping point when James Fields -- who was protesting the statue's removal -- drove his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.Fourteen people and 10 White supremacist and nationalist organizations were sued in a civil lawsuit by some rallygoers and others who argue they suffered life-altering injuries at the protest. The plaintiffs, who include town residents and counterprotesters injured in clashes, are seeking compensatory and statutory damages for the physical and emotional injuries they suffered due to the rally. They also contend rally organizers engaged in a conspiracy and planned the violence to ignite a race and religious war. Defense attorneys and two high-profile defendants who are representing themselves argued none of the plaintiffs had proven the defendants had organized racial violence.Closing arguments concluded Thursday -- sending the legal battle to the jury. The jurors got the verdict forms Friday morning and started deliberating. US District Judge Norman K. Moon said that after Friday court will run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ""Only time I change that if all the jurors agree and want to go beyond that,"" Moon said.The jury will decide in each instance whether a defendant is liable for damages. In a civil trial, plaintiffs' attorneys have to show a defendant is liable by a ""preponderance of evidence,"" Moon told jurors, meaning 50.1% or greater chance of the claim is true.To succeed, the plaintiffs must prove the existence of a conspiracy involving two or more people, according to instructions given to the jurors. Also, plaintiffs must prove that the conspiracy was partially motivated by ""animus"" toward Black or Jewish people or because the plaintiffs supported those communities and that such conspiracy aimed to deprive them of their right to be free from racially motivated violence, the jury instructions say.Finally, the plaintiffs must prove that at least one person in the conspiracy ""took an overt act"" in continuing the racial violence and that the plaintiffs were injured because of that act, according to the instructions.The plaintiffs who were hit by Fields' car are seeking $7 million to $10 million in compensatory damages while others are asking for $3 million to $5 million, according to one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, Roberta Kaplan. It doesn't matter that some defendants didn't know each other, plaintiffs' attorney saysA large team of powerful lawyers under the umbrella of the non-profit Integrity First for America are representing the plaintiffs in their civil case. On Thursday during closing arguments, attorneys for the plaintiffs told the jury that the defendants had prepared for the ""Battle of Charlottesville,"" and messages sent between them and their actions after the violence were proof of a conspiracy.Kaplan told the jurors that they should find the defendants liable ""under the law, under the facts and under common sense."" Another attorney for the plaintiffs, Karen Dunn, pointed to defendant Christopher Cantwell's involvement in the rally alleging, ""He was there because he had an enormous following of armed extremists. ... He could promote, facilitate and execute violence."" Dunn also demonstrated to jury how the rally organizers put out calls to get shields and bring other weapons, including flagpoles and pepper spray, which they referred to as ""gas."" She also showed messages from other White supremacists who support the idea that demonstrators in the street should be run over. ""This is reasonable foreseeability,"" said Dunn said, arguing that all the members are liable for this.""The evidence in this case is crystal clear that this plan went as intended,""  Dunn said.Dunn noted that many of the defendants claim they didn't know what was going on or that they didn't know each other, but ""that doesn't matter, they're still part of the conspiracy.""""This is about the use of force. This was about occupying space and that was the plan for the Battle of Charlottesville,"" Dunn said. Defense says they didn't initiate deadly violence James Kolenich, attorney for Jason Kessler and two other defendants, told the jury, ""Hearing all this testimony or hearing all this from the plaintiffs, I want you to say, 'So what.'""He said the horrific injuries that many of the plaintiffs suffered ""don't prove a conspiracy. And the plaintiffs never claimed they did.""Spencer, who is defending himself, said he was not part of a conspiracy because he never participated in chats on an app used by other defendants. Then, in a tense moment between Spencer and the judge, Spencer recalled then-President Donald Trump's infamous statement about the rally: ""There were good people on both sides."" But Moon told him that quote was never entered into evidence. Spencer said he agreed with the sentiment, ignoring the judge's orders.""There were some bad people on both sides,'' Spencer said, referring to antifa.The defense notably displayed less cohesion than the plaintiffs -- oftentimes shifting the blame for the violence, arguing they didn't like each other, taking snipes at one another and alleging they barely knew each other.They have said they did not initiate the deadly violence that ensued, arguing they were exercising their First Amendment right to protest. They also say there was no conspiracy, and the violence stemmed from law enforcement's failure to keep the opposing groups separated.",0
49," (CNN)President Joe Biden on Friday temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy for one hour and 25 minutes, according to the White House. The nation's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president broke yet another barrier when she temporarily stepped into the acting role. Harris worked from her office in the West Wing while Biden was under anesthesia, according to Psaki. ""@POTUS spoke with @VP and @WHCOS at approximately 11:35am this morning. @POTUS was in good spirits and at that time resumed his duties. He will remain at Walter Reed as he completes the rest of his routine physical,"" Psaki tweeted. Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, arrived Friday morning at Walter Reed Medical Center to undergo his first routine annual physical since taking office. It's routine for a vice president to assume presidential powers while the president undergoes a medical procedure that requires anesthesia. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney did so on multiple occasions when then-President George W. Bush underwent routine colonoscopies.To officially transfer the presidential powers to Harris, Biden sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the president pro tempore of the Senate, at 10:10 a.m. ET before going under anesthesia.  The letter reads: ""Today I will undergo a routine medical procedure requiring sedation. In view of present circumstances, I have determined to transfer temporarily the powers and duties of the office of President of the United States to the Vice President during the brief period of the procedure and recovery.""Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution says the President can send a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore of the Senate declaring declaring they are ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.""In order to transfer the powers back to Biden, a separate letter was sent after the procedure. ""In accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, I hereby transmit to you my written declaration that I am able to discharge the powers and duties of the Office of the President of the United States and that I am resuming those powers and duties,"" the letter, which was sent to both Pelosi and Leahy, reads. Earlier this year, former President Donald Trump's ex-press secretary Stephanie Grisham heavily implied that Biden's predecessor underwent a colonoscopy in a secret visit to Walter Reed in 2019, but kept it quiet to avoid transferring presidential power to then-Vice President Mike Pence.In her book, ""I'll Take Your Questions Now,"" Grisham does not use the term colonoscopy but heavily implies that's what the trip was for. She says Trump's hospital visit, which stirred weeks-long speculation about his health was a ""very common procedure,"" during which ""a patient is put under."" She also writes that Bush had a similar procedure while in office. Grisham writes Trump did not want then-Vice President Mike Pence to be in power while he was sedated, which was part of the reason he kept his visit private. He also ""did not want to be the butt of a joke"" on late-night television, writes Grisham.Biden is the oldest first-term president in US history, and the last comprehensive update on Biden's medical history came nearly two years ago when his presidential campaign released a three-page summary of his medical history in December 2019. Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009, described Biden as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male,"" at the time.The 2019 summary showed Biden was being treated for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, or AFib -- an irregular heartbeat that O'Connor said Biden experiences no symptoms of. He was taking Crestor to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as Eliquis to prevent blood clots, Nexium for acid reflux, and Allegra and a nasal spray for seasonal allergies.The most significant medical event in Biden's history, O'Connor wrote, was when Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988. He was serving in the Senate at the time. During surgery, doctors found a second aneurysm that had not bled, which they also treated. While in the hospital after that surgery, Biden suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Doctors at the time inserted an ""inferior vena cava filter,"" which would prevent future blood clots from reaching the heart and lungs and treated him with an oral anti-coagulant for several months.This story has been updated with additional information.

50," (CNN)What's that we hear? Is it the sound of prominent conservatives and Trump allies openly rebuking former President Donald Trump? Are these the early murmurs of a conservative backlash against Trump? And is it possible a political lane is opening for another Republican presidential candidate in 2024?It's too soon to know, of course, and there's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.The statements from Rupert Murdoch -- who controls a media empire that includes, among other properties, the shamelessly pro-Trump Fox News -- and from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- an adviser who worked with the former president and helped him prepare for the presidential debates during the 2020 election -- may serve as a test for Republicans who understand just how harmful Trump's dominance of the GOP is, and how it could ultimately sink the party.It was startling when Murdoch, addressing his company at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said that the United States faces a number of major political decisions that conservatives will fail to shape unless Trump moves on. ""The current American political debate is profound,"" he said, citing education, welfare and economic opportunity. ""It is crucial that conservatives play an active, forceful role in that debate,"" he added, ""but that will not happen if President Trump stays focused on the past.""Murdoch is not alone in arguing that Trump is a threat to conservatives. Christie, who has just published a new book that looks very much like his unofficial entry into the 2024 presidential race, is making the same case, only more forcefully.Consider the title of Christie's book -- which effectively labels Trump a threat to the GOP: ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Notice that Trump fits two of the three reasons the party needs saving (by Christie, presumably).Murdoch and Christie are not the first Republicans who have stood up to the former president --  but their rebukes of Trump are markedly different. Trump's early critics, like Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and others, melted into passionate defenders once their criticisms proved perilous to their own standing. Their reversals bring to mind a quote often attributed to Groucho Marx: ""Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others."" Christie says many in the GOP are frightened of Trump, whose ""conduct is meant to instill fear."" Conservative Republicans who refuse to fall in line, such as Rep. Liz Cheney, are being hounded out of a party that is increasingly remade into the former president's raging, iconoclastic and intolerant brand.Sure, it's possible Murdoch and Christie's words may also fail to change the course of the GOP, but their criticism is different. They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party -- and the rest of the country -- that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.Coincidentally or not, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, finally acknowledged Biden's win on Thursday, more than a year after the 2020 vote. ""Painfully,"" she said, ""Joe Biden won the election and it's very painful to watch. He's the President. We know that."" Murdoch and Christie undoubtedly have their own personal motives for speaking out against Trump in this moment, and there's plenty of evidence to warrant accusations of hypocrisy. Murdoch, whose Fox News -- home of Tucker Carlson, a purveyor of harmful lies and propaganda about everything from the Covid vaccine to American democracy -- is still serving Trump's goals. But Fox News now faces billion-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by two voting technology companies that allege the network spread false claims of election fraud. Murdoch might be driven by a fear of liability and the potential damage additional lawsuits could inflict on his bottom line if Fox News continues to follow Trump down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and baseless claims. There is, also the possibility that he cares about the future of conservative politics, and genuinely fears the GOP might get trampled if Trump doesn't let up.Christie, for his part, is trying to promote his book and his prospects of occupying the White House.Still, it is remarkable that they have done the calculus and decided they can benefit from speaking out against the former president, even after other Republicans have been badly hurt by doing the same thing. I think their calculation makes sense. With President Joe Biden's ratings sinking, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are doomed. But it is Republicans who may be doomed if they continue to stick with the former president.There's no doubt the Biden administration is terrible at messaging. The economy is booming and yet consumers are feeling pessimistic. Meanwhile, Biden is making important legislative progress, and the inflationary pressures that are creating the false impression that the economy is failing could be resolved in time to boost Democrats' fortunes.Even if Democrats are still in the doldrums in 2024, it's hard to imagine that voters will be yearning for another four years of Trumpian chaos. Biden may look uninspiring now, but the former president, who had the most consistently poor approval ratings of any president in the modern era, remains highly unpopular and controversial. Do Republicans want a candidate embroiled in endless -- and serious -- legal troubles? According to the New York Times, prosecutors are likely to impanel a grand jury in Georgia in the criminal investigation of the former president's attempt to overturn the 2020 election (In September, he suggested he was being unfairly targeted, saying, ""Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me."") Meanwhile, prosecutors in New York have convened a second grand jury to hear evidence about Trump Organization's business practices, according to the Washington Post. (The first grand jury, which convened this spring, charged two Trump companies and an executive with tax evasion. Trump, who was not charged, blasted the indictment and called the investigation a ""political witch hunt."")A Pew poll conducted in September found that two-thirds of Republicans want Trump to remain a major force in the party, but only 44% want him to run again. One-third of Republicans and 92% of Democrats don't want him to be a major national political figure going forward. That's not the arithmetic of victory. There's the potential for a post-Trump Republican Party to gain ground. It still seems like a long shot at this point, but if his critics are successful in persuading the GOP to move in a different direction, there's a chance American democracy can return some semblance of normality, where political leaders debate what policies are best for the country, without fear of upsetting the tender, explosive feelings of a very bad loser.",0
51," (CNN)Here's what Kevin McCarthy wants you to think about his 8+ hour floor speech in opposition to President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" social safety net plan: He believes that the legislation is so harmful to American society that he was compelled to hold the House floor for much of Thursday night and Friday morning in order to express his profound displeasure with Democrats pushing the bill. But, that's not what's really going on here.Start here: This was all for show. McCarthy knows full well that as the minority party in the House, he and his Republican colleagues have precious little they can do to stop the Democratic majority from passing this $1.75 trillion spending bill and sending it to the Senate. What McCarthy was really trying to prove is that he is Trump-y enough for Trump conservatives who, of late, have begun to sound the alarm that McCarthy is not doing enough to fight the Biden agenda.It's absolutely no coincidence that McCarthy's speech came just hours after former Trump White House chief off staff (and House member) Mark Meadows lambasted his leadership.""They're not skating to where the puck is,"" Meadows said of McCarthy and his leadership team in an interview on Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz's podcast. ""And so I would give them a grade of a 'D'."" Separately, in a conversation with former Trump White House political adviser Steve Bannon, Meadows suggested that, if Republicans take over the House majority in 2022, they should put the former president in as Speaker. ""I'd love to see the gavel go from Nancy Pelosi to Donald Trump,"" Meadows said. ""You talk about melting down. People would go crazy!""And, as Politico noted Thursday, Meadows hasn't been the only pro-Trump voice who has spoken out against McCarthy this week.Peter Navarro, a close Trump ally, said that McCarthy's decision not to put any of his people on the January 6 select committee was ""arguably the dumbest checkers move in a chess game I've ever seen."" And Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said that McCarthy was ""weak"" for his refusal to punish the 13 Republicans who supported the Biden infrastructure plan. McCarthy needed a high profile way of proving to the growing chorus of critics that he was plenty Trump-y.  And what better way to do that than to hold the House floor for eight hours with a speech in which every single bit of red meat was thrown to Trump-aligned conservatives? McCarthy, quite clearly, was hoping to catch Trump's attention -- and win his favor -- with that performance and, in so doing, quiet his critics.McCarthy is likely still stinging from what happened to him in 2015 in the wake of then House Speaker John Boehner's surprise resignation. McCarthy was widely seen as the next Speaker but resistance from among the most conservative elements of the House Republican conference led McCarthy to withdraw in favor of then-Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.That history makes McCarthy uniquely aware of the danger to his goal of becoming Speaker from any resistance within the Trump wing of the party. And knocking his critics back was his real aim with this House filibuster. It remains to be seen if McCarthy succeeded in that effort.",0
52,"Washington (CNN)When it came to light in January 2017, just days before Donald Trump took office, the so-called Steele dossier landed like a bombshell and sent shockwaves around the world with its salacious allegations about Trump and his supposed ties to Russia.The central allegations, that Trump conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election and that Russia had compromising information on him, were given a veneer of credibility because they originated from a retired British spy, Christopher Steele, who had a solid reputation.But five years later, the credibility of the dossier has significantly diminished.A series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of its central allegations and exposed the unreliability of Steele's sources. They also raise serious questions about the political underpinnings of some key explosive claims about Trump by shedding new light on the involvement of some well-connected Democrats in the dossier, and separate efforts to prod the FBI to investigate ties between Trump's campaign and Russia.These revelations have triggered a reckoning around the Steele dossier, particularly in the wake of two recent indictments secured by John Durham, the special counsel appointed during the Trump administration to investigate the FBI's Russia probe. Durham alleges that Steele's primary source, a US-based foreign policy analyst, repeatedly lied to the FBI about where he got his information.To be clear, multiple US government inquiries uncovered dozens of contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russians, which have since been acknowledged. The candidate himself and his closest advisers even welcomed the Kremlin's interference in the election. Still, none of it added up to the collusion suggested in Steele's memos.Legitimate questions are now being raised about the dossier -- how it was used by Democrats as a political weapon against Trump, how it was handled by the FBI and US intelligence agencies, and how it was portrayed in the mainstream media.Democrats' hidden hand revealed  Trump swiftly rejected Steele's claims and said a ""group of opponents ... put that crap together."" Nearly five years later, it's clearer than ever that he wasn't too far off about the origins of the dossier.Two special counsel investigations, multiple congressional inquiries, civil lawsuits in the US and the United Kingdom, and an internal Justice Department review have now fully unspooled the behind-the-scenes role that some Democrats played in this saga. They paid for the research, funneled information to Steele's sources, and then urged the FBI to investigate Trump's connections to Russia.Mother Jones first revealed the existence of the dossier a few days before the 2016 election, and said the memos were part of an ""opposition research project"" underwritten by Democrats. Nearly a year passed before the full truth came out about the financing: The money flowed from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign to law firm Perkins Coie, to the research company Fusion GPS, and then ultimately to Steele, who got $168,000.(Anti-Trump Republicans initially funded Fusion GPS' research during the 2016 GOP primaries, but the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee picked up the tab before Steele got involved.)But Democratic involvement in Steele's work was much deeper than previously known. Court filings from the Durham inquiry recently revealed that some information in the dossier originated from Charles Dolan, 71, a public relations executive with expertise in Russian affairs who had a decades-long political relationship with the Clinton family. He has not been accused of any crimes.Federal prosecutors said Dolan was in regular contact in 2016 with Steele's primary source Igor Danchenko, 49, a Russian citizen and foreign policy analyst who lives in Virginia. Danchenko was indicted on November 4 for allegedly lying to the FBI about his dealings with Dolan and a fellow Soviet-born expat that he claimed was one of his sources.Danchenko pleaded not guilty last week. In a statement to CNN, his defense attorney Mark Schamel said Durham is pushing a ""false narrative designed to humiliate and slander a renowned expert in business intelligence for political gain."" Schamel also accused Durham of including legally unnecessary information in the 39-page indictment to smear Danchenko.""For the past five years, those with an agenda have sought to expose Mr. Danchenko's identity and tarnish his reputation while undermining U.S. National Security,"" Schamel said. ""...This latest injustice will not stand. We will expose how Mr. Danchenko has been unfairly maligned by these false allegations.""The indictment indirectly connected Dolan to the infamous claim that Russia possessed a compromising tape of Trump with prostitutes in Moscow, which became known as the ""pee tape."" (Trump and Russia both denied the allegations.) According to the Danchenko indictment, in June 2016, Dolan toured the Ritz-Carlton suite where the alleged liaison occurred, and discussed Trump's 2013 visit with hotel staff, but wasn't told about any sexual escapades. It's still unclear where those salacious details that ended up in the dossier came from.Dolan was also indirectly linked in the indictment to still-unverified claims about Russian officials who were allegedly part of the election meddling. The indictment also suggested that Steele's memos exaggerated what Dolan had passed along to Danchenko.The indictment also says the dossier contained a relatively mundane item about Trump campaign infighting that Dolan later told the FBI he actually gleaned from news articles. Prosecutors say Dolan even lied to Danchenko about where he got the gossip, by attributing it to a ""GOP friend"" who was ""a close associate of Trump.""An attorney representing Dolan, Ralph Martin, declined to comment for this story because his client ""is a witness in an ongoing case.""Durham explicitly stated in the Danchenko indictment that the Clinton campaign didn't direct, and wasn't aware of, Dolan's activities regarding the dossier. Clinton has said she only learned about the dossier when it was posted online, two months after the 2016 election. Senior Clinton campaign aides also said they found out about Steele's work from press reports.Clinton's allies prod the FBI  The Danchenko indictment raises new concerns about the circular nature of portions of Steele's work, and how it fit into a larger effort by Democrats to dirty up Trump. Clinton's campaign funded the project, and we now know that much of the material in Steele's memos ended up being mere political gossip. Steele then sent his explosive but unverified findings to the FBI and State Department.While Steele was passing his tips onto the FBI in fall 2016, a Clinton campaign lawyer separately met with a senior FBI official and gave him information about strange cyberactivity between servers at the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia.The lawyer, Michael Sussmann, has since been charged with lying to the FBI during that meeting, for allegedly saying he wasn't providing the dirt on behalf of any client, even though he ultimately billed that time to the Clinton campaign, and also billed them for other work he did on the server issue. Durham says Sussmann repeated this lie during a meeting with CIA officials in February 2017, where he told them about the server theory. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.The indictment says Sussman peddled the same material to a Slate reporter, who published a story right before the election. The story said reputable computer scientists uncovered unusual activity between servers belonging to the Trump Organization and the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, suggesting a secret backchannel.The Trump Organization and Alfa Bank both denied there was a backchannel. The FBI investigated the underlying data and ruled out any improper cyber links by February 2017.But after the Slate article came out, Clinton's campaign went on a PR blitz, tying Trump to Russia. Clinton had already slammed Trump for months, for embracing Russia's interference in the election, which included releasing hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee.Sussmann was a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie, which indirectly hired Steele. Both men separately went to the FBI in 2016 with dirt about Trump, though there's no indication Sussmann knew about the dossier. (A 2019 Justice Department watchdog report pointed out that the FBI routinely accepts information from biased or dubious sources, and then investigators try to independently vet the material.)After he was charged, Sussmann resigned from Perkins Coie. He declined to comment for this story.Rumors, hearsay and fabrications   When the dossier burst into public view, much of the conversation revolved around Steele's résumé: He worked undercover in Moscow, ran the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters, and maintained a network of sources in the country. This lent credibility to his findings, even though nobody, including CNN, was able to confirm the explosive allegations of collusion or the salacious ""pee tape"" claims.In January 2017, CNN broke the story that senior US intelligence officials had briefed Trump and then-President Barack Obama about the dossier. CNN never published the dossier itself, but hours later, BuzzFeed posted the full 35 pages of Steele's memos online for all to see. CNN said the author was ""a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.""That was true. The FBI formalized Steele's role as a confidential informant in 2013. He aided the FBI's groundbreaking corruption case against dozens of FIFA soccer officials in 2015, and he also provided the FBI with reliable information about Russian oligarchs.But the once well-connected British spy had been out of the intelligence services for a while.For starters, we now know that Steele's primary source, Danchenko, wasn't some deep-cover Kremlin insider. He was a DC-based think tank analyst with a Rolodex of Russians.The FBI tracked down Danchenko and interviewed him a few times in 2017 while they scrambled to verify the dossier. Danchenko said the information he gave to Steele was mostly ""hearsay,"" ""just talk,"" ""word of mouth,"" and came from ""conversations he had with friends over beers."" Danchenko also said Steele puffed up the memos and leaned too hard into the raw information he received, according to a bombshell 2019 report from Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz about the Russia probe.Some of Steele's sourcing disintegrates  The Danchenko indictment alleges that he lied to the FBI, and possibly Steele too, about another detail that became central to the dossier: where he heard there was a ""well-developed conspiracy of cooperation"" between Trump and the Kremlin.In interviews with the FBI, Danchenko attributed the information to Sergei Millian, a Belarusian-American businessman who did some real estate work with the Trump Organization. The indictment also says Danchenko sourced the ""pee tape"" story, in part, to Millian. But Millian wasn't the source, Durham says, contradicting press reports from 2017. (Some outlets recently corrected or clarified those reports.)Millian has since said he was ""framed"" by Danchenko and has publicly denied that they ever spoke, though there is no indication in the indictment that Millian ever denied it to the FBI or under oath.""This fraud destroyed my health, life, businesses and turned my American dream into (a) nightmare,"" Millian told CNN in a statement, declining further comment.A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released last year said Millian's behavior during the 2016 election ""resembles activities by a Russian intelligence officer or cooptee."" He has vehemently denied working for the Russian government.Another Russian who Danchenko told the FBI was one of his sources said in a sworn affidavit in a civil case that she wasn't the source for at least one claim that was attributed to her. The woman, publicist Olga Galkina, said she believes Danchenko told the FBI she was his source ""to create more authoritativeness for his work,"" according to court filings.The indictment against Danchenko quotes emails where Galkina told Dolan she is a ""big Hillary fan,"" and hoped to land a job at the State Department after Clinton became president.Taken together, these revelations about Dolan, Millian and Galkina raise grave questions about where Danchenko got his information, or if he perhaps made some of it up.Attorneys for Danchenko didn't respond to CNN's request for an interview.The Durham investigation is ongoing. He continues to use a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, signaling that he might be interested in bringing charges against additional defendants.'Underpinned by poor judgment'   It took five years of criminal investigations, civil cases and congressional reports to pull back the curtain on the flimsiness of the dossier. The big picture really came into focus in 2019 with the release of a Justice Department watchdog report.That report described for the first time Danchenko's many walk-backs in his FBI interviews. It also said FBI agents gave Steele mixed reviews, with some seeing him as a ""person of integrity,"" while others said he had a ""lack of self-awareness"" and was ""underpinned by poor judgment,"" even if he was acting in good faith.The report also said the CIA viewed Steele's material as an ""Internet rumor.""Last year's bipartisan Senate report said ""the tradecraft reflected in the dossier is generally poor relative to (US intelligence community) standards."" The blockbuster 966-page report also raised concerns that some of the material Steele put in his memos was Russian disinformation.These revelations undermined Steele's credibility -- and led to renewed scrutiny and right-wing criticism of how many news outlets, including CNN, covered the dossier story.Efforts to corroborate fall flat   Everyone but Steele talked about his work for nearly five years, but he finally broke his silence in an ABC News interview last month, shortly before Danchenko was arrested. (Steele and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence, declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview.)Steele defended his work and said he was right about three big takeaways from his memos: Russian spy agencies interfered in the 2016 election; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the operation; and the goal was to help Trump and hurt Clinton.He pointed to the US intelligence community's landmark 2017 report that said Russia meddled in the election at Putin's orders to help Trump. US intelligence agencies had examined the dossier but didn't rely on his findings for their report.But Steele's findings on Russian election-meddling, which were ahead of the curve at the time, now seem more like prescient geopolitical observations rather than insider information. Plus, his final and most consequential takeaway -- that Trump's campaign worked hand-in-hand with the Kremlin -- was essentially debunked by special counsel Robert Mueller's sweeping investigation.CNN reported in February 2017 that US investigators had corroborated some of the communications detailed in the dossier, citing multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials.The CNN report said US investigators were able to confirm the time, place and people involved in some of the conversations between foreign nationals mentioned by Steele. The story said CNN couldn't confirm if those conversations were about Trump, and the sources told CNN that the corroborated information had nothing to do with the salacious claims in the dossier.The sources also told CNN that the corroboration gave investigators ""greater confidence"" in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier, which the FBI was still actively investigating at the time.Two years later, the Justice Department watchdog said only limited information was corroborated from the dossier relating to ""time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available.""Horowitz's watchdog report, released in December 2019, also said much of the material in the dossier about Trump and his campaign ""could not be corroborated"" and that ""certain allegations were inaccurate or inconsistent"" with subsequent FBI findings.But Horowitz said the FBI determined that Steele's big-picture conclusions about Russian meddling were ""consistent with known efforts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections.""What's right? What's wrong?   Looking at the big picture, Steele was right that Russia used ""trusted agents of influence"" to target Trump's inner circle. And he was correct to suspect there were secret contacts between Trump aides and Russian officials, even though Trump denied any Russian ties. But Steele was wrong about so many of the key details.Despite a worldwide hunt for the Trump ""kompromat,"" no tapes ever emerged, and the Danchenko indictment puts the source of that underlying claim into doubt.There is no proof of something in the dossier that would've been a smoking gun for collusion -- that Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen went to Prague in 2016 to coordinate with Russian officials about their anti-Clinton hacking efforts. The watchdog report said the FBI concluded that these claims ""were not true."" Even after Cohen turned on Trump and started helping Mueller, and implicated his former boss in an illegal campaign finance scheme, Cohen always denied the Prague allegations.The dossier said Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and foreign policy adviser Carter Page led the collusion efforts. But this was never verified by any government investigations. Mueller found that both men had extensive contacts with Russian agents, but he couldn't verify that Page met with the specific Kremlin officials as alleged in the dossier.The Mueller report said there wasn't evidence of a criminal conspiracy to collude.Five years on, Steele continues to defend his work. He told ABC News that ""the evidence suggests"" there was collusion, that he believes Cohen traveled to Prague after all, and that the compromising tape of Trump with Russian prostitutes ""probably"" exists.""I stand by the work we did, the sources that we had, and the professionalism which we applied to it,"" Steele said in the interview with ABC News.Origins of the Russia probe  Democratic officials, the media and Internet conspiracy theorists initially hyped Steele's work. But as his credibility waned, Trump started exaggerating Steele's influence, and pushed the lie that the dossier triggered ""the entire Russia probe.""In truth, the dossier played a remarkably limited role in the Russia investigation.Four US government reports concluded that the probe began in July 2016, two months before the FBI team handling the inquiry even learned about the dossier.(After a lengthy review, Horowitz said there was a legal basis to open the Russia probe, and that the process was free of political bias. However, Durham publicly rebuked Horowitz and said he disagreed with some of Horowitz's conclusions, leading to criticism that his own work is politically motivated.)Mueller's team interviewed Steele, but largely ignored the dossier as they found dozens of links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller's report didn't say all that much about the dossier, and he didn't attribute any findings to Steele.And there's no indication that the dossier influenced Mueller's successful criminal prosecutions against six Trump campaign associates: Manafort, Cohen, Roger Stone, Rick Gates, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos.But the dossier did play a major role in the investigation into Page, the lower-level Trump foreign policy adviser, and helped the FBI secure a warrant to wiretap him after he left the campaign in September 2016.Tainted FBI wiretaps  The fallout from the dossier was largely contained to the Page surveillance. But when internal investigators looked under the hood, they found catastrophic issues.Before the dossier, investigators already considered applying for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to wiretap Page's communications, but they weren't sure if they could establish probable cause. The dossier's explosive claims about Page's alleged meetings during his recent trip to Moscow ""pushed it over"" the line, a lawyer involved in the case told the Justice Department watchdog.The FBI included snippets of Steele's reporting in the FISA application, along with other information, like details of Page's previous interactions with Russian spies, and the fact that he suggested to an FBI informant that he had an ""open checkbook"" from the Kremlin. The secretive FISA court approved the warrant in October 2016, as well as three subsequent renewal requests, meaning Page was wiretapped for about one year.In April 2017, CNN was first to report that the FBI included some material from the dossier in the FISA applications. The article said prosecutors would only have done this ""after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation,"" according to officials familiar with the process.It's now clear that this level of verification never materialized. The watchdog report said Steele's claims about Page ""remained uncorroborated"" when the wiretaps ended in 2017.Page was never charged with any crimes, and Mueller said his investigation ""did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government"" to meddle in the election, which was a far cry from the FBI's initial assertions in FISA applications that Page ""is an agent of a foreign power"" who was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian Government.""The inspector general examined the FBI's handling of the FISA applications and found that there were widespread mistakes, omissions and errors that deeply undermined the integrity of the process. In response, the Justice Department declared that the final two FISA warrants against Page were legally invalid.But even Durham, who has been accused of cherry-picking an unfair narrative to undermine the Russia probe, hasn't said in his recent indictments, spanning 66 pages, that the FBI or Mueller ever relied on Steele for anything beyond the Page surveillance.Partial vindication for Trump    Critics of the Russia probe -- conservative pundits, Republican lawmakers and Trump himself -- took a victory lap after the inspector general blasted the Page FISA applications.That's because the inspector general's report confirmed what many of them had argued all along, including in a highly disputed memo from GOP Rep. Devin Nunes: That there were systemic problems with the FBI surveillance of someone tied to the Trump, and the Steele dossier was improperly used to influence part of the Russia probe.But the report refuted the more outlandish conspiracy theories that Trump, Nunes and other Republicans pushed about the Russia probe. The report said the FISA process, while flawed, wasn't intentionally abused and wasn't politically biased. And the report debunked Trump's lie that the FBI planted spies in his campaign.The latest Durham indictments also injected new life into Russia probe skeptics.After wall-to-wall coverage of the Steele dossier, public opinion was quickly locked in on the question of collusion. Many Democrats clung to hope that the dossier was true. Most Republicans denounced it as a deep state hoax. Post-Mueller polling found that about half of Americans believed Trump was guilty of collusion.Mueller and a bipartisan Senate inquiry concluded that Trump's team welcomed Russian help, and tried to coordinate on a few fronts, but it didn't come to fruition.But so much suspicion was fueled by Trump's massive cover-up about Russia.Trump and his team systematically lied about almost every aspect of the Russia probe. (At the start, they falsely denied any contacts with Russians.) After so many of their denials were disproved, they repeatedly shifted their story. Trump repeatedly undermined and obstructed Mueller's investigation.All the while, Trump heaped praise on Putin. He infamously took Putin's side at the 2018 Helsinki summit by agreeing with Putin's lie that Russia didn't try to help Trump win in 2016, leading many to wonder if Trump was compromised after all.",0
53,"New York (CNN Business)The oil market has gone from booming to busting, much to the relief of inflation-weary American drivers ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.US crude tumbled to a fresh seven-week low on Friday, settling at $76.10 a barrel. The slide is good news for American drivers hurt by the seven-year high in gasoline prices — a crunch that has soured consumers' views on the US economy. ""We will definitely see some pricing relief on gasoline at the pump,"" Tom Kloza, president of the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN on Friday, adding that the relief will be ""feather-like as opposed to plunges.""After a relentless rise, the national average gas price has finally leveled off at $3.41 a gallon, according to AAA. That's roughly flat from a week ago.""It looks for now as though the 2021 peaks have been established,"" Kloza said.Lockdown jittersUnfortunately, one of the catalysts for Friday's tumble in the market is another ominous development on the Covid front: Austria announced plans Friday to impose a national lockdown, the first in Europe this fall, in a bid to reverse a spike in Covid-19 cases.The lockdown is raising fears in the oil market of tough new health restrictions elsewhere that will slow the economic comeback and eat into energy demand.""The demand signals today are overwhelmingly bearish,"" Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a note on Friday. ""The risk is real in Europe, especially if Austria's move to lockdown has a domino effect across the continent. If Germany follows suit, sub-$80 price levels may be here to stay.""Will China and America team up?Beyond the lockdown fears, oil markets remain jittery over the specter of the United States and China teaming up to intervene in the previously red-hot energy markets.Since crashing to negative-$40 a barrel in April 2020, US crude has climbed as much as $125 a barrel because supply simply hasn't kept up with demand. OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have only gradually increased production. US oil companies haven't been in a rush to add supply either.A coordinated release from two of the world's biggest energy consumers would have a bigger impact than if the Biden administration acted alone to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Officials in China put out a statement on Friday suggesting that a release of barrels from the country's emergency reserve is on the table.""The bureau is pushing forward with crude oil release-related work at the moment,"" authorities that oversee China's strategic oil reserves said in a statement to CNN.According to a readout published by the White House, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed during their virtual summit this week the ""importance of taking measures to address global energy supplies.""A coordinated release by the United States and China could also be used as a bargaining tool to get OPEC+ to open up the taps, after months of refusing to do so.""There is firepower with a concerted effort,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.'Short-term fix'Still, this is not a long-term solution, as releasing barrels from emergency reserves doesn't solve the underlying supply-demand mismatch. And these emergency reserves hold a finite amount of oil — crude that is typically reserved for supply shocks, not surging demand amid an economic recovery.Releasing barrels today leaves the reserves with less of buffer for the next crisis, whether it's a hurricane, a conflict in the Middle East or another supply shock.Goldman Sachs reiterated in a new report to clients on Thursday that a coordinated release would ""only provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit.""The Wall Street bank argued this coordinated release is now ""fully priced in,"" meaning the impact to markets has already happened.""In fact, if such a release is confirmed and manages to keep oil prices depressed in the context of low trading activity into year-end, it would create clear upside risks to our 2022 price forecast,"" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote.In other words, at least some on Wall Street are already looking past this emergency intervention — before it even happens — and predicting higher prices ahead.",0
54,"New York (CNN Business)An animated dumpling called ""Dart,"" with a shiny gold chrome body that pops out of its head when you squeeze its squishy cheeks, is creating quite a stir as parents scramble to score one of this year's must-have toys.Dart belongs to a family of interactive dumplings from toymaker WowWee that hit stores in mid July. They're basically what the name suggests -- squeezable but inedible dumplings big enough to fit into the palm of your hand.And they're increasingly difficult to find. Like with everything, blame the supply chain.""It's a s**tshow,"" said Michael Yanofsky, the company's managing director of sales. ""It's not just the holdup at the ports, it's labor shortages and backups all along the transportation network that's been a struggle to get the toys to retailers.""""Our bet is made for Black Friday,"" said Yanofsky. ""Whatever inventory of dumplings is in is it and we hope it all makes it onto store shelve. There's no chance of getting more unless we put them on planes.""WowWee is trying to navigate the serious supply chain issues to ensure it has enough inventory overall of its dumplings to satisfy strong demand through to Christmas. The dumplings, like most toys sold in the United States, are made in China. Sold outThe first four in the lineup are named ""Doe,"" ""Dip,"" ""Dee"" and ""Dot."" They each speak a weird ""Squish-Pop"" language and giggle and laugh. The cheeks change color and the top of their head lights up to a color code that matches their current ""mood"" -- energetic, happy, silly. Then along came ""Mel the Marshamallow, "" ""Peace the Peach"" and ""Coco the Cotton Candy Cloud.""But it's Dart, the golden dumpling who flaunts 24K gold glasses, that everyone desperately wants. He's sold out on Amazon (AMZN) where WowWee launched him at the end September. Dart has been popping up on eBay  (EBAY)at twice the retail price.Its popularity even caught the attention of MyBookie.com, an offshore gaming site, which was accepting bets this month on whether the squishy little golden dumpling would sell out on Amazon before Black Friday. Hitting all the trendsThe $15 dumpling toy is popular because it's hitting a few dominant trends in toys right now, said Marissa Silva, editor-in-chief of The Toy Insider, a toy review and news website.She said kids are obsessed with collecting tiny cute toys that come in tiny packages, as proven by the Shopkins mania. ""Dumplings are a little bit bigger but collectible,"" said Silva. ""They're also affordable and not overly complicated for kids to figure out.""Plus, the soft squishy texture of the dumpling and the popping out of their body also cleverly plays into the current bubble fidget poppers toy craze.There's one other appeal: the food inspiration.""Food-themed toys continue to be very hot trend. We've seen this with Shopkins and with Mini Brands,"" said Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of Toys, Tots, Pets & More, an industry review website. Mini Brands are tiny shrunken versions of popular consumer products like a can of Spam, or a bottle of Dove Body Wash that come hidden in tiny bags.""""These food-inspired toys are also so easy for kids to have fun with on social media,"" said Silver.The squishy dumplings are the brainchild of Sydney Wiseman, vice president of brand development and creative strategy for WowWee. She came up with the idea for them 18 moths ago. ""I wanted to do a toy based on a dumpling for a long time,"" she said. And she wanted the dumpling characters to be in a band. That aspect is infused in their look and the accessories they wear.More are comingWowWee in August announced a partnership with Nickelodeon to produce animated digital music videos that feature the squishy characters in a band.Wiseman is thrilled with the dumplings popularity overall, and especially of Dart's, which WowWee only produced 100,000 pieces of as a very limited character. She said Dart holds a special meaning for the WowWee team. ""He's named after a dear friend of ours at WowWee, Art Janis, who recently passed away,"" she said.There's still a possibility to score Dart after Black Friday. WowWee is launching a two-pack set with the golden dumpling and a rose gold dumpling on November 30 on Amazon.",0
55,"Washington, DC (CNN)Westport, Connecticut police chief Foti Koskinas would love it if his patrol cars could drive themselves, but his department isn't buying Teslas equipped with ""full self-driving.""  Local governments like Westport and businesses big and small sing the benefits of electric vehicles like Teslas. Westport has saved thousands on fuel and maintenance since purchasing a Model 3 in 2019. Police departments are among the fleet operators that are increasingly turning to electric vehicles for the economic and environmental benefits. Koskinas said he's received more than 500 inquiries from departments around the world asking about Westport's use of electric vehicles.  Westport has saved nearly $7,000 a year on fuel and maintenance costs, he said. There could be more savings coming. Westport expects to save $5,000 a vehicle if it can use Tesla's on-car computer, rather than installing its own for critical features like scanning license plates, controlling lights and sirens, and radioing colleagues. Discussions are on-going between Westport and Tesla, Koskinas said. But for all their Tesla enthusiasm, there's one feature they overwhelmingly aren't touching — ""full self-driving."" Some say the technology isn't ready yet.  The $10,000 optional software feature includes driver-assist features that Tesla hopes will one day allow the cars to drive themselves. (The price is likely to increase, as it has in the past, so the best time to buy is likely now, for those who believe in the technology's future.) Not all Teslas have ""full self-driving."" Currently, ""full self-driving"" is available in Beta form and has only been released to a limited group of people. It can change lanes in some cases, respond to most traffic signals and steer the car.  The technology is far from perfect and requires an attentive driver behind the wheel to take control at a moment's notice. It ""may do the wrong thing at the worst time,"" Tesla warns.  Koskinas can envision the benefits if his department's cars could be trusted to drive responsibly, always doing the right thing. He said officers responding to incidents sometimes end up riding in an ambulance to a hospital, to offer support. But they must leave their patrol car behind.  ""How great if that vehicle drives itself to the hospital and meets the officer there?"" he said.  If Teslas could do that, he might buy ""full self-driving,"" he said.   ""We're just not there,"" Koskinas said of the technology today. The ""full-self driving"" option can be added to Teslas in the future even if it is not purchased at the time of sale.  Westport, Connecticut is one of six police departments that told CNN Business that they have purchased at least one Tesla, but not the ""full self-driving"" feature.  Police departments aren't the only ones taking a pass. Hertz announced in October it will purchase 100,000 Teslas, but not ""full self-driving."" Brightline, the private train operator in Florida, has a Tesla fleet of nearly 50 vehicles to give passengers rides to its train stations, which reopened this month. Revel, a mobility startup, started using Tesla Model Ys to offer rides in Manhattan this year.  Most of the Tesla buyers decline to say why they are not buying ""full self-driving."" But the technology's limits appear clear and are likely a factor. Thilo Koslowski, a consultant at AutoDGTL focused on automotive technology, told CNN Business that ""full self-driving"" is not currently a good value for fleet operators, given the technology's limits and its cost. ""They're not gaining the benefits they're looking for,"" Koslowski said. ""It's not full self-driving. It becomes a question of if it's worthwhile to spend the money."" Fleet operators want safer driving and more productive vehicles, according to Koslowski. He said there is no objective data proving that ""full self-driving"" is safer than a human driver. ""Full self-driving"" has not been shown to make Teslas today more productive, he said. Fleet operators could theoretically face liability risks if ""full self-driving"" would be active during a crash, according to Koslowski. ""That risk overshadows any potential benefits you could get from this,"" Koslowski said. ""It's such a murky gray area that I think the risk is way too high for rental companies to do that.""  The technology's limitations have been documented. Tesla drivers testing ""full self-driving"" have described it as inconsistent, sometimes impressing them, other times alarming them. Videos shot by drivers using Teslas with ""full self-driving"" show that it can brake and turn unexpectedly, and sometimes drive down the middle of the road rather than making space for other drivers.  Several Teslas using ""full self-driving"" have crashed into curbs, damaging the cars' wheels. A person who identified themselves as a Tesla owner reported to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration this month that their Tesla had been severely damaged after crashing into a vehicle while using ""full self-driving."" The agency is seeking more information about the crash, according to spokesperson Lucia Sanchez.  Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has alluded to the limits of ""full self-driving.""   ""We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition,"" he said on a Tesla earnings call this summer.  At the time he also questioned the merits of paying for a subscription version of ""full self-driving."" Then drivers with ""full self-driving"" were receiving a limited set of features, like automated lane changes.  ""Like right now, is it -- does it make sense for somebody to do [full self-driving] subscription? I think it's debatable. But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear,"" Musk said.  Tesla has repeatedly missed deadlines on when it expects its autonomous system to be widely deployed and has not issued a recent estimate for a broad deployment of ""full self-driving.""  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.  ",0
56," (CNN)A federal judge suggested Friday that former President Donald Trump had some responsibility for the January 6 attack on the Capitol and that rioters were pawns provoked into action.Speaking at sentencing hearing for rioter John Lolos, the judge said rallygoers like him were ""called to Washington, DC, by an elected official, prompted to walk to the Capitol by an elected official.""Judge Amit Mehta called individuals who stormed the building ""a pawn in the game played by people who know better.""""People like Mr. Lolos were told lies, were told falsehoods, were told the election was stolen when it was not,"" Mehta said. ""Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos who were told those lies took it to heart. And they are the ones paying the consequences.""""Those who created the conditions that lead to Mr. Lolos' conduct have in no meaningful measure been held accountable,"" he said. ""You were a pawn. You were a pawn in the game played by people who know better.""While many judges have expressed continuing concern about the volatile political climate, Mehta is one of the first to call out Trump -- although not by name -- for using his supporters for political gain and then abandoning those supporters to suffer the consequences, something Mehta believes should perhaps weigh in favor of lighter sentences for January 6 defendants charged with less serious crimes.Mehta is a crucial judge overseeing some of the more than 660 Capitol riot cases in federal court because he is also handling the largest and most significant conspiracy case against defendants connected to the Oath Keepers. It was his first sentencing of a January 6 defendant. ""That kind of conduct needs to be deterred because, frankly, conditions in our country don't give me a lot of confidence that this sort of thing won't happen again,"" Mehta said.Lolos, 48, pleaded guilty in August to illegally demonstrating in the Capitol building. Mehta sentenced Lolos to 14 days in jail and ordered him to pay $500 for damage done to the Capitol during the riot. Of the 40 defendants sentenced so far, 18 have been sentenced to jail or prison time. In a rambling speech to the court, Lolos, at times speaking with different accents, rehashed debunked claims of widespread voter fraud, said police encouraged him to go into the Capitol, claimed evidence against him was tainted, and encouraged anyone listening in on the court's public call-in line to look up a video of himself online. Lolos refused to speak to his defense attorney, who repeatedly tried to stop Lolos from talking.""I may have failed to explain why incarceration is necessary here, but I think Mr. Lolos just summed it up,"" prosecutors said when Lolos was finished talking.Mehta said it was 'regrettable"" that Lolos still believes that the election was stolen, but said it was understandable because ""a lie isn't easy to unhear."" According to court documents, Lolos spent almost 45 minutes inside the Capitol on January 6, and was videotaped shouting, ""They left, we did it"" as he exited the building. On January 8, a Delta flight crew decided to turn the plane around because Lolos, a passenger on the flight, was continuously yelling, ""Trump 2020!"" Lolos was escorted off the plane by a Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department officer, and was rebooked on a later flight. About 45 minutes later, the same officer recognized Lolos in an Instagram video that showed him leaving the Capitol. The officer reported Lolos to Capitol Police officers in the airport, and Lolos was arrested.",0
57," (CNN)Republicans in Wisconsin are engaging in a multi-pronged attack on the state's bipartisan election commission -- in one of the latest efforts to relitigate the 2020 election in a key presidential battleground state.Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has publicly urged fellow Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature to take over the running of federal elections in the state and direct local officials to ignore election guidance issued by the Wisconsin Elections Commission.His push, first reported by The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, comes after a Republican sheriff in Racine County called for five members of the state's six-member election commission to be charged with felonies because they waived a requirement to send poll workers into nursing homes during the pandemic. On Monday, Rebecca Kleefisch, a Republican running for governor, asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to find that the commission's election guidance runs counter to state law. Johnson's calls for a legislative takeover of the elections system demonstrate ""the firm grasp that the (Donald) Trump wing of the Republican Party has not only everywhere, but particularly here in Wisconsin,"" said Jay Heck, who runs the state branch of Common Cause. ""It's a lot of political bluster, but it has to be taken seriously in these times,"" he added.Johnson did not immediately respond to an interview request from CNN. But he told The Journal-Sentinel that the state legislature should claim authority over the election system and argued that the state's Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is powerless to stop it.""There's no mention of the governor in the Constitution"" when it comes to running elections, Johnson told the newspaper. ""It says state legislatures, and so if I were running the joint -- and I'm not -- I would come out and I would just say, 'We're reclaiming our authority. Don't listen to WEC anymore. Their guidances are null and void.' """"I think the state Legislature has to reassert, reclaim this authority over our election system,"" he added.Some Republicans aligned with Trump have advanced an aggressive interpretation of the so-called ""independent state legislature doctrine,"" which argues state legislators have full power over federal elections.Top GOP lawmakers in Wisconsin have cast doubts on Johnson's proposal. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said recently that he's not sure there is a ""legal opportunity"" for such a takeover.And Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos told reporters that the issue did not come up at a recent meeting with Johnson. ""The idea that somehow we are going to take over the elections and do all those things, I've never studied that,"" Vos said. ""I don't know about it.""'We did not break the law'Wisconsin will be a key swing state in 2024. President Joe Biden won it by a little more than 20,600 votes in 2020; Trump captured it four years earlier by fewer than 23,000 votes.The Wisconsin Elections Commission, established by Republican lawmakers six years ago, has faced anger and scrutiny from GOP officials about its guidance to local election officials in the run-up to the 2020 election.A top issue: The commission's 5-1 decision advising election clerks around the state not to send poll workers, known as special voting deputies, into nursing homes during the pandemic. Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling announced last month that an investigation by his office determined that employees at a nursing home in his county had helped residents cast ballots, which he said violated state law.He recommended election fraud and misconduct charges be lodged against the five commission members who approved the guidance.Officials with the commission said they did nothing wrong. They said the change in procedures was discussed in public meetings and occurred only because state and federal guidance limited access to nursing homes to avoid spreading the coronavirus to vulnerable residents.""To put it simply, we did not break the law,"" Ann Jacobs, a Democrat who chairs the commission, said in a statement, responding to Schmaling. ""In fact, without action from the Commission, many residents in Wisconsin care facilities could have and would have been disenfranchised and not able to vote in the 2020 elections.""Mark L. Thomsen, the Democratic vice chair of the commission, condemned Republicans' efforts in Wisconsin during an interview on Friday with CNN's Don Lemon. ""In 2016, President Trump won the election by the same rules. 2020, President Biden won the election by the same rules,"" Thomsen said. ""And to adopt Senator Johnson's attack would be a complete unlawful act, unheard of. It really is astounding.""Other efforts to relitigate or undo the 2020 election persist in Wisconsin. A former state Supreme Court justice is continuing a Republican-ordered investigation into the election.And this week, Wisconsin GOP state Rep. Timothy Ramthun moved to advance a resolution to decertify Biden's victory -- despite an analysis by lawyers on the state's non-partisan legislative council, noting that there is no mechanism in state or federal law to do so. Trump issued a statement, cheering on Ramthun's move.Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, however, said lawmakers would not take up the resolution, citing the legislative council analysis.Wisconsin election observers say the current debate may be a warmup for a takeover of the state's election system ahead of 2024 and the next presidential election.""As a matter of law, given that we now have a Democratic governor, this is mostly talk,"" Robert Yablon, an election law expert at the University of Wisconsin's law school, said of the debate over who runs elections.""If there is unified Republican control in Wisconsin after 2022,"" he added, ""the fact that these discussions are being had now is a strong signal that (Republicans) would very much try to move in the direction of replacing the elections commission with more unilateral, partisan control.""",0
58," (CNN)President Joe Biden on Friday temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy for one hour and 25 minutes, according to the White House. The nation's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president broke yet another barrier when she temporarily stepped into the acting role. Harris worked from her office in the West Wing while Biden was under anesthesia, according to Psaki. ""@POTUS spoke with @VP and @WHCOS at approximately 11:35am this morning. @POTUS was in good spirits and at that time resumed his duties. He will remain at Walter Reed as he completes the rest of his routine physical,"" Psaki tweeted. Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, arrived Friday morning at Walter Reed Medical Center to undergo his first routine annual physical since taking office. It's routine for a vice president to assume presidential powers while the president undergoes a medical procedure that requires anesthesia. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney did so on multiple occasions when then-President George W. Bush underwent routine colonoscopies.To officially transfer the presidential powers to Harris, Biden sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the president pro tempore of the Senate, at 10:10 a.m. ET before going under anesthesia.  The letter reads: ""Today I will undergo a routine medical procedure requiring sedation. In view of present circumstances, I have determined to transfer temporarily the powers and duties of the office of President of the United States to the Vice President during the brief period of the procedure and recovery.""Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution says the President can send a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore of the Senate declaring declaring they are ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.""In order to transfer the powers back to Biden, a separate letter was sent after the procedure. ""In accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, I hereby transmit to you my written declaration that I am able to discharge the powers and duties of the Office of the President of the United States and that I am resuming those powers and duties,"" the letter, which was sent to both Pelosi and Leahy, reads. Earlier this year, former President Donald Trump's ex-press secretary Stephanie Grisham heavily implied that Biden's predecessor underwent a colonoscopy in a secret visit to Walter Reed in 2019, but kept it quiet to avoid transferring presidential power to then-Vice President Mike Pence.In her book, ""I'll Take Your Questions Now,"" Grisham does not use the term colonoscopy but heavily implies that's what the trip was for. She says Trump's hospital visit, which stirred weeks-long speculation about his health was a ""very common procedure,"" during which ""a patient is put under."" She also writes that Bush had a similar procedure while in office. Grisham writes Trump did not want then-Vice President Mike Pence to be in power while he was sedated, which was part of the reason he kept his visit private. He also ""did not want to be the butt of a joke"" on late-night television, writes Grisham.Biden is the oldest first-term president in US history, and the last comprehensive update on Biden's medical history came nearly two years ago when his presidential campaign released a three-page summary of his medical history in December 2019. Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009, described Biden as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male,"" at the time.The 2019 summary showed Biden was being treated for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, or AFib -- an irregular heartbeat that O'Connor said Biden experiences no symptoms of. He was taking Crestor to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as Eliquis to prevent blood clots, Nexium for acid reflux, and Allegra and a nasal spray for seasonal allergies.The most significant medical event in Biden's history, O'Connor wrote, was when Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988. He was serving in the Senate at the time. During surgery, doctors found a second aneurysm that had not bled, which they also treated. While in the hospital after that surgery, Biden suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Doctors at the time inserted an ""inferior vena cava filter,"" which would prevent future blood clots from reaching the heart and lungs and treated him with an oral anti-coagulant for several months.This story has been updated with additional information.

59," (CNN)House Democrats have voted to pass President Joe Biden's sweeping $1.9 trillion social safety net expansion legislation, a victory for the party even as the legislation faces a tough road ahead in the Senate.The final tally was 220 to 213. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the only Democrat to vote against the bill and no Republicans voted for it.The vote took place on Friday morning after House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy stalled an effort to vote Thursday evening by delivering a record-breaking marathon floor speech overnight.The sweeping economic legislation stands as a key pillar of Biden's domestic agenda. It would deliver on longstanding Democratic priorities by dramatically expanding social services for Americans, working to mitigate the climate crisis, increasing access to health care and delivering aid to families and children.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrated the legislation's passage after the vote. ""This bill is monumental. It's historic, it's transformative, it's bigger than anything we've ever done,"" she said at a press conference. But Democrats face a major challenge now that the bill has been approved by the House and must be taken up by the Senate, an effort that will put party unity to the ultimate test. Senate Democrats have no margin of error to approve the legislation and key lawmakers -- most prominently moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin -- have expressed concerns over elements of the plan as policy fights loom on the horizon.What's in the bill The social safety net expansion plan, known as the Build Back Better Act, represents a central part of Biden's policy agenda and an attempt by congressional Democrats to enact a major expansion of the social safety net.The House and Senate recently passed, and Biden then signed into law, a separate $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, which marked a major legislative achievement for both parties.The Build Back Better Act is an effort by Democrats to build on that investment in traditional infrastructure by making extensive investments to ramp up social programs and address the climate crisis.Among its many provisions, the legislation would create a universal pre-K program, extend the enhanced child tax credit and expand access to health care, affordable housing and home care for seniors.Democrats argue that the provisions in the bill are urgently needed and will widely benefit Americans. Republicans, meanwhile, have decried the legislation as a reckless and partisan tax and spending spree.The Congressional Budget Office released its final scoring for the bill early Thursday evening, estimating that the package ""would result in a net increase in the deficit totaling $367 billion,"" according to a summary.But the White House has worked to make the case that the bill will be fully paid for, despite the CBO analysis showing a shortfall.The CBO analysis does not include revenue from tighter IRS enforcement. The CBO estimated earlier that would raise $207 billion.The White House argues that increased IRS enforcement would actually raise more than what the CBO projects, meaning the bill would be fully paid for in their estimate.Tough road ahead in the Senate The legislation is expected to undergo major revisions in the Senate as Democrats who have expressed concerns over aspects of the package are likely to demand significant changes. That would then require the House to vote again -- on a final version of the legislation -- in the coming weeks before it goes to Biden's desk. Senate Democrats need all 50 members of their caucus to support the bill in order to pass it under a budget process they are using to advance the measure without GOP votes known as reconciliation. That makes the task for Democrats particularly difficult since it means there can be no defections and passage will require total unity. In an early sign of the impending efforts to change the bill, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in a statement after the House vote that the Senate will ""strengthen"" the bill.""I applaud Democrats in the House of Representatives for uniting to pass the Build Back Better Act. The Senate has an opportunity to make this a truly historic piece of legislation. We will listen to the demands of the American people and strengthen the bill,"" Sanders tweeted. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement after the House vote that the Senate ""will act as quickly as possible"" to take up the legislation. Pelosi downplayed the potential for significant changes to the legislation in the Senate. ""Ninety-some percent of the bill was written together, House, Senate, White House. There were some differences at the end, and we'll deal with those as we go forward,"" Pelosi said at a press conference after the House vote. ""We'll see where we need to, shall we say, reconcile our differences, but at the end of the day we will have a great bill,"" she said. Democrats pass bill after McCarthy's marathon speechDemocrats have an extremely slim majority in the House and can only afford to lose three votes and still pass legislation. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN ahead of the vote that he only knew of one expected Democratic defection, which was Golden. Golden told the Bangor Daily News on Thursday night he opposed the bill over provisions to raise the limit on state and local tax deductions, but did not rule out the possibility of backing the measure in future votes. The House vote Friday morning came after McCarthy stalled floor action with a speech railing against Democrats that stretched into the early hours of Friday morning.McCarthy took to the House floor at 8:38 p.m. ET on Thursday to begin speaking and did not finish speaking until eight hours and 32 minutes later, the longest House floor speech in the chamber's history. Hoyer announced shortly after midnight that the vote, which had been expected as soon as Thursday evening, would be postponed until later Friday. ""He wants to do it in the dead of night,"" Hoyer said, referring to McCarthy. ""We are going to do it in the day.""This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.",0
60," (CNN)After months of negotiations, the House passed the Democrats' sweeping $1.9 trillion budget reconciliation package on Friday. The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would transform the nation's social safety net despite being whittled down to roughly half its original size amid infighting between the party's moderate and progressive wings. It would create a universal pre-K program, assist families with child care and send them the enhanced child tax credit for another year. It would also provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges through 2025 and offer federal help to those who fall below the poverty line.It would funnel nearly $570 billion into climate measures, attempt to address affordable housing shortfalls and provide money to parents to buy their kids food over the summer.The legislation would increase the deficit by $367 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But that doesn't count revenue raised from enhanced tax enforcement, which the office found would bring in $207 billion over 10 years.The legislation's path in the Senate remains uncertain, and more revisions are expected. Some Democrats, particularly Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have voiced concerns about various provisions in the bill, as well as the speed at which it is going through Congress.Democrats are planning to use a procedure called reconciliation so that they can approve the bill in the Senate with just 50 votes, which would alleviate the need for support from Republicans. But since the Democrats have only 50 members in the chamber, they still can't afford to lose a single vote within their own party.Here's what's in:Universal pre-K: The bill would provide free pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. It would expand access to 6 million children a year. Funding would last six years. The provision, along with the child care measure, would cost an estimated $381.5 billion, according to the CBO.Child care: The legislation would limit child care costs for families with children younger than age 6 to no more than 7% of income for those earning up to 250% of state median income, expanding access to about 20 million children. Funding would last six years. The provision, along with the universal pre-K measure, would cost an estimated $381.5 billion, according to the CBO.Paid family and sick leave: Biden also wants to create a federally funded paid family and sick leave program for the millions of Americans who don't already receive the benefit from their employer. He first called for 12 weeks of paid leave, which was then reduced to four weeks during negotiations. The House bill includes four weeks of paid family and sick leave, costing an estimated $194 billion -- but the provision is likely to be cut out of the legislation once it is taken up by the Senate. Manchin is opposed to including the benefit in this bill, and Democrats can't afford to lose one vote. A program that provides four weeks of paid family and sick leave would cost $205.5 billion, according to the CBO.Enhanced child tax credit: The beefed-up child tax credit -- which provides $300 a month for each child under age 6 and $250 a month for each one ages 6 through 17 -- would be extended through 2022 for more than 35 million families. Heads of household earning up to $112,500 and joint filers making up to $150,000 annually would qualify for the enhanced payments. But, unlike in 2021, only these families would receive the funds in monthly installments next year. Eligible parents with higher incomes would have to claim the credit on their tax return the following year.The credit would be made permanently refundable so the lowest income families would continue to qualify. The enhancement, which was part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package Democrats enacted earlier this year, is currently only in place for 2021. This credit, along with the earned income tax credit, would cost about $203 billion, according to the CBO.The House bill unveiled in September would have extended the credit through 2025.Earned income tax credit: The expanded earned income tax credit would be extended through 2022, helping 17 million low-wage childless workers. The boost, also part of the relief package, is only in place for this year. It nearly triples the maximum credit childless workers can receive, extends eligibility to more people, reduces the minimum age and eliminates the upper age limit. This credit, along with the enhanced child tax credit, would cost about $203 billion, according to the CBO.The earlier House bill would have extended it permanently.Home health care: The proposal calls for permanently improving Medicaid coverage for home care services for seniors and people with disabilities, with the goal of reducing the more than 800,000 people on state Medicaid waiting lists. It also aims to improve the quality of caregiving jobs. The measure would cost nearly $158 billion, according to the CBO.Originally, Biden had hoped to shower $400 billion on this effort as part of his infrastructure package.Affordable Care Act subsidies: The enhanced federal premium subsidies would be extended through 2025 under the bill. It would reduce the cost of coverage on the Obamacare exchanges, particularly for moderate-income and middle-class Americans. The boost, also part of the Democrats' relief package, is currently set to expire after 2022. This provision, along with Medicaid expansion, would cost $126 billion, according to the White House's latest estimate. And the number of uninsured Americans would drop by 3.4 million, mainly due to the subsidies extension and the Medicaid provision, according to the CBO.The initial House bill would have made the enhancement permanent.The legislation also would extend for one year a provision of the American Rescue Plan that allows those receiving unemployment benefits to qualify for federal subsidies that reduce their monthly premiums to as little as $0.This provision would cost $74 billion, according to the CBO.Medicaid coverage gap: The Democrats are calling for providing Affordable Care Act premium subsidies for low-income Americans in the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid, enabling them to buy Obamacare policies with no monthly premiums, through 2025.Doing so would cost about $57 billion, the CBO estimates.The original House bill would have provided premium subsidies to low-income Americans until the Department of Health and Human Services would have set up a federal Medicaid expansion program that would have picked up the entire tab for enrollees' medical care. However, several Democrats from states that already expanded Medicaid raised objections because their states have to foot 10% of the bill, while the federal government picks up 90%.The bill would also increase the federal assistance for expansion states to 93% through 2025.And it would require state Medicaid programs to provide 12 months of eligibility to women after they give birth. States now typically provide 60 days of coverage.Medicare hearing benefits: Hearing services would be covered under Medicare, starting in 2023, but vision and dental benefits would not be included. Only 30% of seniors over age 70 who could benefit from hearing aids have ever used them, the White House said.This measure would cost $36.7 billion, according to the CBO.Climate change: The bill would deliver nearly $570 billion in tax credits and investments aimed at combating climate change. It would offer tax credits to families that install solar rooftops or buy electric vehicles, for example. The investments are aimed at providing incentives to grow domestic supply chains in solar and wind industries. The legislation also calls for creating 300,000 jobs by establishing a Civilian Climate Corps that works to conserve public lands and bolster community resiliency.Affordable housing: The legislation would funnel $25 billion into the construction, rehabilitation or purchase of affordable homes for low-income people and for the creation and preservation of affordable rental housing. It would provide $65 billion to address the capital needs backlog of public housing and would bolster rental assistance to hundreds of thousands of families. The measure would also invest in down payment assistance and in community-led redevelopment projects in under-resourced neighborhoods. And it would provide $24 billion to fund housing vouchers and supportive services.The effort would cost about $148.1 billion, according to the CBO.Pell grants: The measure would increase the maximum Pell grant by $550 for more than 5 million students enrolled in public and private nonprofit colleges and expand access to undocumented students brought to the US as children, who are known as Dreamers.It would invest in historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve underrepresented communities. And it would increase funding for workforce development.These provisions would cost a total of $39.8 billion, according to the CBO's estimate.Children's nutrition: The bill would expand free school meals to nearly 9 million children during the school year and provide the parents of 29 million kids a $65 per child per month benefit to purchase food during the summer.Immigration: The President has called for a $100 billion investment to reform the nation's immigration system, as well as reduce backlogs, expand legal representation and make changes to the asylum system and border processing. But the Senate parliamentarian, who has the final say on whether the legislation adheres to procedural rules, has ruled twice against arguments from Democrats to include an immigration provision in the economic bill. Still, some Democrats are continuing to push to include protections for undocumented immigrants in the bill and plan to present another plan to the parliamentarian. The cost of the immigration provision is not currently included in the total cost of the legislation. State and local tax deduction: It is critical to some Democrats from the Northeast and West Coast that the package lifts or repeals the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, that was put in place by the Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. Under the House bill, deductions would be capped at $80,000 per year over a nine-year time span. But many Democrats are opposed to lifting the cap, which would largely benefit higher-income households. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have proposed an income threshold limiting those who can deduct a higher amount.Here's how Democrats will pay for itThe Democrats fractured over measures to cover their original sweeping $3.5 trillion spending proposal. Initial plans to make companies and well-off Americans pay by raising the corporate tax rate and the top marginal individual income and capital gains rates were scuttled by Democratic moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.The party then floated a billionaire tax on the capital gains of the super-wealthy, but that quickly withered after resistance from Manchin, another key Democratic moderate, and several others in the Senate and House.Biden and congressional Democratic leaders ultimately settled on a mix of corporate and individual revenue raising measures, along with two prescription drug provisions.Under the House version, most middle-income families with children would get a tax cut in 2022 -- thanks to an expanded child tax credit -- and those without kids would generally see little change in their tax bills, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Overall, nearly 40% of households would see a tax cut and nearly 19% would pay more in 2022 than they do now, according to the analysis. However, about 70% of those earning more than $1 million a year would enjoy a tax cut.Corporate taxes: The bill would put in place a 15% minimum tax on the corporate profits that large companies report to shareholders, not to the Internal Revenue Service. This would apply to companies with more than $1 billion in profits. The legislation also includes a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks. Also, it would impose a 15% minimum tax, calculated on a country-by-country basis, that American companies pay on foreign profits, consistent with an agreement Biden recently won among 136 countries. The provisions would yield an estimated $814 billion, the Joint Committee on Taxation said.Taxes on the rich: The wealthiest Americans would pay a 5% surcharge on income above $10 million, and an additional 3% levy on income above $25 million. Next year, about 30,000 tax filers are expected to make $10 million or more, according to the Tax Policy Center. About 12,000 of them are likely to earn at least $25 million.The bill would also close the loopholes that allow some affluent taxpayers to avoid paying the 3.8% net investment income tax on their earnings. And it would continue the limitation on excess business losses. This measure would raise $640 billion, the committee estimates.IRS enforcement: The bill would beef up IRS enforcement so that it can ensure that people are paying what they owe to Uncle Sam. The new enforcement measure would focus on Americans with the highest incomes, not those earning less than $400,000 a year. The CBO estimates that the provision would raise revenue by $207 billion -- far less than the $400 billion that the Treasury Department had projected. But White House officials have been arguing for weeks that the numbers would not line up due to methodological differences, criticizing the way the CBO accounts for the indirect effects the enhanced enforcement would have. Medicare drug negotiation: The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors' offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services Secretary would negotiate up to 10 drugs in 2025. The number would rise to up to 20 medications starting in 2028. This controversial provision, which was dropped from the package and then restored after a deal was reached in the Senate, is a far more limited proposal than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past.The legislation would also impose penalties if drug companies increase their prices faster than inflation. And it would redesign Medicare's Part D drug plans so that seniors and people with disabilities wouldn't pay more than $2,000 for medications bought at the pharmacy. The bill would also cap what Americans pay for insulin at $35 a month.About 10 fewer drugs would be introduced in the US market over the next three decades if the bill were enacted, the CBO projects. About 1,300 drugs are expected to be approved over that time period under current law, the agency said.Drug rebate rule: The bill calls for blocking the implementation of a Trump administration regulation that would change the drug industry's rebate system, though it isn't set to go into effect until 2026. The rule effectively would ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers. Instead, drug companies would be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. Altogether, the prescription drug measures would save around $297 billion, including about $79 billion from allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, according to the CBO. Prior House efforts to permit drug price negotiations would have saved far more.Here's what's out:Free community college: Biden initially called for making tuition free for two years at community colleges, but it's been dropped entirely from the bill.Medicare dental and vision benefits: The bill does not include expanding Medicare to include vision and dental coverage, both longtime goals of Sanders. Dental coverage, in particular, would have been costly.This story has been updated with details on the House passage of the bill and Congressional Budget Office estimates of its cost.",0
61," (CNN)President Joe Biden said Friday he stands by the not-guilty verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, saying the jury system of trial in the United States works and must be respected.""Look, I stand by what the jury has concluded,"" he said. ""The jury system works, and we have to abide by it.""Rittenhouse, the teenager who killed two people and shot another during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was acquitted Friday of first-degree intentional homicide and four other felony charges. The panel of five men and seven women deliberated more than 25 hours over the past four days in a closely watched case. The verdict cannot be appealed.The President made the comments upon returning to the White House after a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that lasted more than five hours, where he received a routine physical and a colonoscopy.""I just heard a moment ago,"" Biden said, when asked about Rittenhouse being found not guilty on all counts. ""I didn't watch the trial."" In a statement later Friday afternoon, Biden acknowledged that the verdict in the trial ""will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included."" He said that everyone ""must acknowledge that the jury has spoken.""In a statement released by the White House Friday afternoon, Biden said he ""ran on a promise to bring Americans together, because I believe that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.""""I believe that what unites us is far greater than what divides us. I know that we're not going to heal our country's wounds overnight, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under the law,"" the statement reads.Biden also encouraged protesters to ""express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law.""""Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy,"" the statement adds.The President has also spoken with the Wisconsin governor this afternoon and ""offered support and any assistance needed to ensure public safety.""Asked by reporters as he turned to the White House if he stood by his past comments equating Rittenhouse to a white supremacist, Biden didn't directly answer. In September 2020 then-presidential candidate Biden tweeted a video that included Rittenhouse carrying a rifle with the caption: ""There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night."" The video was meant to criticize then-President Donald Trump.When asked on Monday why Biden previously tweeted a video that suggested Rittenhouse is a white supremacist, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: ""What I'm not going to speak to right now is anything about an ongoing trial nor the President's past comments. What I can reiterate is the President's view is that we shouldn't have, broadly speaking, vigilantes patrolling our communities with assault weapons. We shouldn't have opportunists corrupting peaceful protest by rioting and burning down the communities they claim to represent anywhere in the country.""This story has been updated with additional reporting.",0
62," (CNN)President Joe Biden pardoned two turkeys, named Peanut Butter and Jelly, on Friday during the first traditional turkey pardon ceremony of his presidency. In a joke-filled ceremony on the White House's Rose Garden, Biden pardoned the two birds, sparing them both from becoming a presidential meal this holiday season. ""Eventually, Peanut Butter and Jelly were selected based on their temperament, appearance and, I suspect, vaccination status,"" the President joked. ""Yes, instead of getting basted, these two turkeys are getting boosted."" Biden said Peanut Butter and Jelly were ""two names I couldn't agree on more,"" adding, ""I have to admit to you, my wife doesn't like me to admit it -- that's what I like for lunch."" The President also took a moment during the ceremony to acknowledge the Covid-19 pandemic and a return to Thanksgiving traditions with loved ones. ""In all seriousness, it's important to continue traditions like this to remind us how from the darkness, there's light and hope and progress and -- that's what this year's Thanksgiving, in my view, represents,"" the President said. ""So many of us will be gathering with our loved ones for the first time in a long time. And we'll be reconnecting with traditions, with our tables and our hearts full of grace and gratitude for everyone who made it possible."" Biden thanked scientists and front-line workers who developed and administered the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as essential workers, faith leaders and the workers who grow and harvest the food on Americans' tables. The outdoor ceremony, which was attended by White House staffers' families and children, comes two weeks after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed a recommendation to vaccinate children ages 5-11 against Covid-19.Following the ceremony, they will retire to their home state at Purdue University's Animal Sciences Education and Research Farm.The Indiana-raised birds flocked to Washington, DC, this week, staying at the luxe Willard Hotel and attending a news conference on Thursday with the National Turkey Federation ahead of their White House appearance.""Raising the presidential turkey flock has really been a lot of fun this year. As we all know, with another year of uncertainties with the pandemic, this project has really been something to look forward to,"" grower Andrea Welp said on Thursday.The National Turkey Federation became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947 and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since President Harry Truman. Truman was the first to accept a turkey from them -- however, he did not spare the bird.Rumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as the Lincoln administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln's young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.The first documented turkey pardon was given by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, though it didn't catch on right away. Even though President Gerald Ford pardoned President Richard Nixon, neither one of them decided to officially pardon any turkeys.Turkey pardoning became the norm in the White House in 1989 when President George H.W. Bush revived the tradition, now a staple of the White House holiday season.Biden's decision to go on with the tradition comes on a particularly momentous day. Early Friday morning, the President underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed Medical Center. Biden temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he was under anesthesia during the colonoscopy portion of his exam.House Democrats also voted to pass Biden's sweeping $1.9 trillion social safety net expansion legislation, which now faces a tough road ahead in the Senate.And on Friday afternoon, just hours before the pardon was supposed to take place, Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty of first-degree intentional homicide and four other charges on Friday in connection to the fatal shooting of two people and wounding of another during last year's unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.While the Biden administration notched a major legislative win this week with the signing of his infrastructure bill into law, the pardon comes amid inflation at the Thanksgiving table.A new survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation found that Thanksgiving dinner will cost 14% more for Americans this year, with several factors leading to the increased pricing, including more Americans expected to cook at home this year and other economic disruptions. While that survey found that turkey is up 24% since last year, that price is dependent on when the poultry was purchased.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement Wednesday that ""the good news is that the top turkey producers in the country are confident that everyone who wants a bird for their Thanksgiving dinner will be able to get one, and a large one will only cost $1 dollar more than last year.""",0
63,"Strongsville, Ohio  (CNN)Ohio's crowded Republican Senate primary has become a battle over who most can align themselves with former President Donald Trump.The field of more than a dozen candidates includes former Ohio state Treasurer Josh Mandel, former Republican state party Chair Jane Timken, businessman Bernie Moreno, state Sen. Matt Dolan, businessman Mike Gibbons and J.D. Vance, author of the New York Times bestselling book ""Hillbilly Elegy."" Trump has not yet endorsed anyone in the race.The desire to set themselves apart as they worked to be seen as the most Trump-like was on display at a candidate forum this week. There, six of the candidates slammed the Democrat-led voting rights bill the For the People Act and vaccine mandates and reiterated their emphatic support for Trump -- with some repeating the lie that the 2020 election had been ""rigged"" and ""stolen.""  Vance, the most well-known of the candidates, blatantly lied about 2020, claiming that the tech industry had worked with Democrats to rig the election.""That's why we have the disaster we have instead of a second term of Donald Trump,"" he said. Mandel made similar claims.""Every time they try to cancel me, I say it louder and louder. So let me say this very, very clearly: I believe this election was stolen from Donald J. Trump,"" he said.Moreno wanted to assure the crowd he also believed the election was stolen, challenging Mandel's assertion that the former treasurer is the only one in the race who consistently makes the false claim.""I've said that every time. Maybe you showed up late then too and you didn't hear me,"" Moreno said to Mandel.Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, and his support could be key in the competitive primary.""The President is very popular in Ohio, rightfully so. He did some great things for Ohio. He did some great things for the country, so of course we welcome his endorsement, much like the Democrats would welcome Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton's endorsement and Barack Obama's endorsement,"" Moreno told CNN. Vance -- once a Trump critic who wrote in a since-deleted tweet that Trump was ""reprehensible"" -- now emphatically praises the former President. The Middletown native views focusing intensely on cultural conflicts as the path to victory for Republicans across the country. ""For so long, I think Republican officials have been worried that the culture wars are the electoral enemy or at least a weakness for them, and yet it turns out that a lot of our voters are voting around things like whether their kids are being indoctrinated in schools or whether their kids are being told that there are 40 or 50 or 80 genders,"" Vance told the far-right media outlet Breitbart News earlier this month.Vance declined CNN's requests for an interview. Shannon Burns, who leads the Republican Party in Strongsville, said he is leery of Vance's reversal.""I'm suspicious. I think everyone should be suspicious. You hear it, in his own words, what he was saying against President Trump in a way that wasn't policy-driven. He was clearly a self-proclaimed never Trumper,"" he said.Burns credits Trump with transforming the GOP in the Buckeye State.""He has done something for the Republican Party in Ohio that no other candidate has ever been able to do. And that is decisively turn Ohio from what was a purple state, or in some years maybe a blue state, to a hard red state,"" said Burns.Timken suggested she's working to build a coalition that includes both Trump loyalists and non-Trump Republicans.""I am the candidate that can build a winning coalition of the Trump supporters and the education parents and bring back those suburban voters ... in order to not only win a primary but win the general election. You have to be a candidate of addition,"" Timken said Tuesday in an interview in her Columbus campaign office. Her office includes a picture of her with Trump and a large cartoonish banner with the 45th President atop a military-style tank surrounded by fireworks and the American flag.Timken said that top of mind for Ohio voters are inflation and the state of the economy. She took a subtle dig at the more incendiary tactics of her rivals:""You can't win a race in Ohio on Twitter. That's not how you win races in Ohio. ... Saying outrageous things to garner attention is not how I'm going to run this race and not how I'm going to win this race.""Dolan is the only Republican candidate not seeking Trump's endorsement. He doesn't criticize the former President but says the race should be narrowly focused on policy.""President Trump's not going to vote in May of 2022; Ohio Republicans are going to go to vote. And when they look at what I've been able to do, my conservative results here in the state Senate ... they're going to see that those are good Republican ideals that help Ohio grow,"" Dolan said to CNN.",0
64," (CNN)With less than one month until the Army's deadline to vaccinate its active-duty force, the service will begin barring soldiers who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 without an exemption from reenlistment, promotions, and other ""favorable personnel actions.""In a memo dated November 16, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said soldiers who refuse the vaccine would be ""flagged,"" preventing them from ""reenlistment, reassignment, promotion, appearance before a semi-centralized promotion board, issuance of awards and decorations"" and more.The Navy and the Marine Corps issued similar guidance last month, paving the way for the discharge of service members who refuse to be vaccinated.Soldiers who have received an exemption or whose exemption request is pending will not be flagged.The guidance, which also applies to the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, was sent as the head of the Oklahoma National Guard finds himself in dispute with the Pentagon for refusing to enforce the vaccine mandate.The Army's deadline for all active-duty military members to get vaccinated is December 15 while National Guard soldiers are required to be vaccinated by June 30, 2022. Soldiers, including Reserve and Guard, can be flagged even before these deadlines for refusing the vaccine.""The Soldier will remain flagged until they are fully vaccinated, receive an approved medical or administrative exemption, or are separated from the Army,"" Wormuth wrote.A soldier is flagged on the date they make a ""final declination"" to be immunized after meeting with a medical professional and receiving a second order from a commander to get the Covid-19 vaccine.Flagged soldiers will also be ineligible for tuition assistance, attending military or civilian schools, and being paid their enlistment bonuses.Though the Air Force hasn't issued specific guidance about reenlistments or promotions, Secretary Frank Kendall made it clear Thursday that airmen who refuse the vaccine will be discharged.""The bottom line is that willfully disobeying a lawful order is incompatible with military service and to get a vaccination is a lawful order,"" Kendall said in a Facebook event when asked about the vaccine mandate.Last month, the Navy made it clear that it will pursue discharge for any sailors who refuse vaccination without a pending or approved exemption. ""Commands shall not allow Sailors refusing the vaccine to promote or advance, reenlist, or execute orders with the exception of separation orders,"" the Navy said in a press release in October.Shortly thereafter, the Marine Corps followed suit, saying in its vaccination guidance that Marines refusing the Covid-19 vaccine without an exemption would be processed for administrative separation. ""A Marine who has not yet been fully vaccinated is not considered worldwide deployable and shall be assigned or reassigned, locally, to billets which account for health risks to the unvaccinated marine and those working in proximity to the Marine,"" the guidance said. ""Marines refusing the vaccine shall not reenlist or execute order, with the exception of separation orders.""Vaccination requirements for the military have led to a debate between the Pentagon and the commander of the Oklahoma National Guard over the chain of command in the military and the federal government's authority. Pentagon officials have said that all National Guard members are subject to military readiness requirements, including vaccines, even when they are not called up under federal authority. But Brig.

65," (CNN)Construction has been halted on a secret development inside of a Chinese shipping port near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates after intense US pressure, at least for now, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN -- but multiple officials cautioned that the security concerns over the Chinese presence in the country are far from resolved.The port project has been the focus of a flurry of diplomatic engagements in recent months by senior US officials and prominent lawmakers on Capitol Hill and has potentially jeopardized the sale of advanced American jet fighters and other advanced munitions to the UAE. ""Last we checked, we had successfully convinced the Emiratis to shut down the project,"" said one source familiar with the intelligence. ""But it's still a live issue.""The Wall Street Journal first reported that construction on the facility had been halted. US officials for at least a year have been closely watching the construction of what they believed was a military facility inside the commercial Khalifa port, about 50 miles from the UAE capital. The United States considers the UAE a key partner in counterterrorism efforts in the region and has thousands of troops based at an Emirati air base 20 miles outside of Abu Dhabi. Although China -- and the UAE -- portrayed the port venture as purely commercial, US intelligence has observed ships disguised as commercial vessels that officials recognized as a type typically used by the Chinese military for signals intelligence collection entering the port, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence.Officials remain divided over how much the UAE knew about China's intentions. A spokesman for the UAE Embassy in Washington said in a statement that the UAE ""never had an agreement, plan, talks or intention to host a Chinese military base or outpost of any kind."" The US National Security Council declined to comment. The Chinese Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.China developing ports around the worldChina has sought to develop commercial ports in outposts around the world in what US officials see as a clear effort to develop a foothold for military access. China has developed commercial ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as well as built its first overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017. Both the Trump administration and the Biden administration have sought to pressure the UAE to put a stop to the project at the port, which is run by a Chinese shipping conglomerate. Senior US lawmakers also addressed the port project with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, during a visit to the region in June. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a tweet that he had discussed ""our mutual concern regarding Chinese military activities in the Middle East"" with bin Zayed. Even though construction on the secretive development inside the port has now apparently been stopped, current and former officials say the broader Chinese presence in the country still may endanger the planned $23 billion sale of F-35 jets, Reaper drones and other advanced munitions, two sources familiar with the matter explained. ""The F-35 is our crown jewel. We need to be able to protect technology and security for all of our partners,"" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mira Resnick told CNN earlier this week. ""Those are the conversations we are having with Emiratis about what kind of choices they can make now, to make sure they can be part of the F-35 program.""Still, that the Biden administration was able to stop the facility from being built represents a key diplomatic victory in its efforts to compete with China on the international stage, current and former officials say. They point to leverage created by both negotiations on the F-35 -- which may now ease forward -- and the signing of the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and some Gulf nations, including the UAE, under President Donald Trump. ""I am thrilled with this development today,"" Inhofe wrote. ""I look forward to making sure the Biden admin continues productive conversations w/ our Emirati friends about advancing the F-35 sale, which would build our long-term relationship.""On Tuesday, Resnick told reporters in a briefing that the United States remains the ""partner of choice of all our allies in the region.""  ""None of the strategic competitors are able, they're not capable or willing to offer what the United States offers. So our partners and allies are well aware of that, and that is why they consistently choose the United States,"" she said.",0
66," (CNN)A report detailing the findings of an impeachment investigation into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to be released to the public in the coming days, according to three members of the New York State Assembly Judiciary Committee.Members on Thursday and Friday reviewed the 45-page report detailing findings from the independent investigation into allegations against the Democratic former governor launched more than eight months ago. The report addresses topics including the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo, discrepancies in reported deaths in nursing homes from Covid-19, Cuomo's pandemic leadership book deal, claims of the executive chamber's hostile work environment, and Cuomo's level of cooperation with the committee investigators, according to one of the members, Michael Montesano, who spoke with CNN.Montesano, a Republican from Long Island, said the report doesn't read positively for Cuomo, calling it thorough and fact-driven with evidence too strong for the former governor to deny. Investigators draw definitive conclusions in the report that are ""fair and adequate,"" Montesano told CNN. ""It's very fact-driven, OK, and we don't make up the facts. They are what they are,"" Montesano said. ""You'll see the level of detail and again, in my opinion, and what we have to back it up and that's not political, that's fact-driven."" The former governor's legal counsel asked the Assembly committee to allow them a preview of the evidence and report draft, which they have not received.""The Assembly Judiciary Committee has chosen not to review their findings with us which is their prerogative, but it may once again result in a one-sided report,"" Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said in a statement Friday.  Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Lavine declined to comment to CNN on whether the committee would accommodate the Cuomo team's request. The report's release will come more than five months after State Attorney General Letitia James announced that her office's investigation into Cuomo found he had sexually harassed 11 women. The former governor, who resigned shortly after James' report was released, has repeatedly denied all of the allegations, saying he never touched anyone inappropriately, but acknowledged that some of his behavior made others uncomfortable.Montesano told CNN that ""the evidence against (Cuomo) was so overwhelming that he can't step away from what it is,"" particularly regarding staffer Brittany Commisso's previously reported sexual misconduct allegations and those of a state trooper on Cuomo's protective detail first identified in James' report. Committee member Phil Steck, a Democrat, similarly told CNN on Friday that the independent report ""strongly corroborated"" and provided additional evidence that supported the attorney general's findings.Steck added that the report makes clear the former governor ""used his office for the purpose of writing a book to benefit himself."" CNN has previously reported that Cuomo was expected to receive more than $5 million from his book ""American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,"" which was published in October 2020. Cuomo donated $500,000 from his book deal to the United Way of New York State for pandemic relief and vaccination efforts and put the remainder in a trust for his three daughters, Azzopardi previously said in a statement to CNN.""On the issue of the book deal, it's pretty clear that the governor was utilizing the executive chamber as a vehicle for writing a book for his own personal benefit,"" Steck said. In the statement Friday, Azzopardi said: ""State employees volunteered to assist the governor with his book American Crisis and now the Assembly apparently wants to criticize them.""Steck also said the report draws inferences between the timing of the book release and the discrepancy in fatality data as it related to Covid-19 in nursing homes at the time, a much-debated subject earlier this year when James' office published a preliminary report that found the New York State Department of Health ""undercounted"" the Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents. ""Preliminary data obtained by OAG suggests that many nursing home residents died from COVID-19 in hospitals after being transferred from their nursing homes, which is not reflected in DOH's published total nursing home death data,"" a statement from James' office said.""I think you can certainly infer the political motive. ... In the governor's book, there's a chapter on the nursing home, so they were trying to preserve the validity of their claims in the book by distorting the facts regarding nursing home deaths,"" Steck said.  Committee members reviewed the report in a secure location with the sergeant-at-arms and staff present. Phones were not permitted in the room and members could not take a copy with them, according to Steck and Montesano.Attorneys from Davis Polk & Wardwell were appointed independent investigators when the Assembly Judiciary Committee launched the impeachment investigation into the then-governor in March.The investigation was suspended in August when Cuomo resigned, but Assembly leadership opted to allow the investigators to publish a report of their findings for the public.

67," (CNN)Members of the House committee investigating January 6 said on Thursday that many of the questions they have for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have nothing to do with then-President Donald Trump -- suggesting that the panel is still open to discussing the terms of a potential interview. The House select committee has been trying to get Meadows to comply after he defied its subpoena, failing to turn over documents and show up for his deposition last week. Two committee members indicated there are several lines of inquiry that would not be covered by executive privilege.Rep. Pete Aguilar told CNN on Thursday that Meadows, one of Trump's closest advisers, might have a ""minor claim"" to executive privilege over some conversations but emphasized the committee has questions for him that ""have nothing to do with the conversations he had directly with the President.""""His conversations about stopping a free and fair election, about criticizing and stopping the counting of electoral votes, about his coordination with campaign officials on private devices that were not turned over, all of those issues are not privilege worthy and he has some explaining to do,"" the California Democrat added. Rep. Jamie Raskin, another select committee member, also told CNN on Thursday that the committee has ""lots of questions {for Meadows} that have nothing to do with Trump personally."" ""We want Meadows to come in and testify on everything of interest to us,"" he said. ""If he thinks there are some questions that are covered by either executive privilege or the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, he can invoke it and a court can settle it later."" ""But there are certainly a lot of questions that are not even arguably tangentially related to privilege. And those you have to answer,"" the Maryland Democrat added.  The statements come after the current White House indicated last week that concessions do not need to be made for Meadows, notifying him that President Joe Biden will not assert executive privilege or immunity for him on matters related to the probe.The day after that notification, Meadows was a no-show for a scheduled deposition.Previous congressional inquiries have made concessions to close presidential aides. In the late 2000s, in a legal battle over getting testimony from former White House counsel Harriet Miers, the Obama White House engineered a deal that allowed a House committee to conduct interviews it wanted with Miers and former White House chief of staff Josh Bolten by making questions about direct communications with former President George W Bush off limits. A select committee aide told CNN that the panel has not taken any subjects in a potential interview with Meadows off the table and expects to get all the information it is seeking. Meadows' attorney did not respond to CNN's questions about possible negotiations on Thursday.Ahead of his scheduled deposition last week, Meadows' attorney, George J. Terwilliger III, issued a statement saying his client would not cooperate with the committee until courts had ruled on former President Donald Trump's claims of executive privilege, noting ""a sharp legal dispute with the committee.""Aguilar also noted Thursday that there are ways to discuss specific claims of privilege but Meadows is still required to talk to the committee. ""If there were privileged claims, there's a way to address them. What Meadows is saying is he has absolute privilege; he doesn't have to have conversations with us. The courts don't agree with that, past precedent hasn't agreed with that, and Congress has never indicated with that,"" he told CNN later Thursday, expanding on his previous comments. Aguilar added that the record the committee is building shows the large portion of the information it is looking for does not relate to the executive privilege claims that Meadows is making. Last week, White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote to Meadows' attorney, informing him of Biden's decision, and once again cited ""the unique and extraordinary circumstances where Congress is investigating an effort to obstruct the lawful transfer of power under our Constitution.""Su noted that Biden has already determined that executive privilege does not apply to particular subjects within the committee's purview, including ""events within the White House on or about January 6, 2021; attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud; and other efforts to alter election results or obstruct the transfer of power.""The chairman of the House select committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Wednesday that he was signing a letter to send to Meadows outlining everything the committee wants to learn from him, as the panel weighs whether to pursue a criminal contempt referral.This letter would be key to marking the trail of communication between Meadows and the committee, and crucial to building out an eventual criminal contempt referral report, if the committee chooses to go that route.A key question that the committee has said it wants answered by Meadows is whether he was using a private cell phone to communicate on January 6 and where his text messages from that day are.""We have information that that phone may or may not be in his possession. That number is not active anymore that he used, so we just want to know,"" Thompson has said.",0
68," (CNN)Sometimes, during a busy week in Washington, a recap is in order. So let's take stock of the Trump GOP for a moment:GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, a diehard conservative, daughter of a diehard conservative vice president, has been excommunicated from the Wyoming Republican Party.GOP Rep. Paul Gosar, who tweeted a bizarre anime video showing him appearing to kill progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is forgiven at a House GOP caucus meeting. (And when Democrats decided to censure him and remove him from his committee assignments Wednesday, only two Republicans agreed his behavior warranted such punishment. The final vote was 223-207.)And what about those 13 House GOPers who dared to vote for the Biden infrastructure bill, which two-thirds of the American public actually wants? There's talk of stripping them of their committee assignments. Huh?As only Alice in Wonderland might ask of the Republicans, ""Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle.""Well, maybe not such a puzzle.Meet the Trump 2022 caucus, in which all that matters is whether a) you are willing to say the 2020 election was rigged, b) you voted against impeachment, and c) anything Trump is against (like the infrastructure bill), you are against, too. There is room in your heart only for Donald Trump. If you're Kevin McCarthy, add one more priority: becoming House speaker, for which you believe you need Trump. (Even though the ever-loyal Trump has told people he doesn't really like you and could go on a jihad against your bid for the speakership even if you win back the House majority. The august Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene seems to be in favor of that program.) Some might be able to summon some pity for McCarthy, who, after all, is trying to navigate between his moderates and his Gosar goons, but nah. After all, how much is a speakership worth? Enough, apparently to justify a defense of Gosar on the grounds that Democrats are simply a bunch of hypocrites, abusing their power by taking action against a member who threatened another member's life. (Just reminding: Republicans also shrugged or fled for the hills when asked about Trump's offensive, even dangerous, tweets. So at least they're consistent.) But I digress. Back to the unfolding GOP scenario. The worry, says former Republican National Committee communications director Doug Heye, is that the party is heading to a place in which ""we don't have to accept elections and policy doesn't matter, like penalizing people voting for an infrastructure bill."" (Not to mention the fact that Trump himself was gung ho in 2019 for a $2 trillion measure until he walked out because Democrats wouldn't halt their investigations of him.) And the question, Heye adds, is ""How do we get past this?""Good question, but hard to answer given what's going on with Trump's heavy footprint in GOP primaries. His vetting process seems to revolve around a central question: Who likes me the most? Personal vulnerabilities be damned. As a result, by my last count, there are two Trump-endorsed Senate candidates who have been accused of domestic abuse: In Pennsylvania, the party's front-runner, Sean Parnell, has been accused by his estranged wife of choking her and hitting one of their children -- charges he denies. And in Georgia, Trump's buddy Herschel Walker had to answer questions about his ex-wife's accusation that he had held a gun to her head. He said in a 2008 CNN interview that he didn't remember being violent toward his wife, but he didn't deny it. A Walker candidacy is not exactly what Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had in mind, but now Walker has his blessing. Go figure.But wait. There's one wannabe senator with sexual misconduct allegations against him who is still vying for the Trump thumbs-up: former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens. Never mind that he resigned the governorship in 2018 after revelations of an affair with a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct and threats of blackmail. Greitens admitted to the affair, but denied the rest. He's a Trumpist now, as are many in the Missouri GOP US Senate primary race. So the primary is getting ugly, which isn't a happy place for Republicans as they struggle to see whom Trump loves the most.The list of potential problems goes on: Trump wants former Georgia Sen. David Perdue to run against Gov. Brian Kemp, who actually had the temerity to challenge Trump's rigged election conspiracy theories. GOP candidates in Arizona are still talking rigged election to make Trump happy, as are Republicans in Ohio. It is as if they have nothing else to run on. The irony, of course, is that they do.  All of which pleases Democrats. ""He's elevated problematic and flawed candidates,"" says David Bergstein, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""It's intensified vicious and expensive infighting. And he's deterred some candidates from entering some races.""Consider GOP New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu -- seen as a great Senate recruit -- who recently declined to run for the seat. While he has declared himself a Trump supporter in the past, he also was reelected in 2020 with 65% of the vote -- 20 points better than Trump. Considered a moderate, he complained about gridlock in Washington as a reason for deciding against a run. But he's not exactly a candidate who would have been excited to worship at the shrine of Trump. Sure, divisive primaries can fade by next November. And no doubt about it, Democrats are waging an uphill battle given President Joe Biden's dismal approval ratings. Not to mention the fact that 70% of Americans say the economy is in bad shape. And yes, Republican Glenn Youngkin won in Virginia by straddling the Trump effect. But remember: He had no primary, winning a party convention. And in a blue state, establishing some distance from the ex-President is an easier task. Trump still says Youngkin won because of him.From Mar-a-Lago, Trump is happily playing kingmaker, and it's working. New Republican candidates are afraid to challenge him; Republican incumbents cower, too. And it's only getting worse. Among the talking points: McConnell should resign; anyone who votes for Biden legislation should be punished; the rigged election was real; there was no January 6 insurrection.The Republicans, in an otherwise admirable political environment, are somehow being driven by the man who once lost it all for them. A truly Alice in Wonderland predicament. As Alice asked the Cheshire Cat: ""Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"" To which the Cat responds: ""That depends a good deal on where you want to get to."" Sadly, it seems, all roads now lead to Donald Trump.",0
69,"Washington (CNN)When it came to light in January 2017, just days before Donald Trump took office, the so-called Steele dossier landed like a bombshell and sent shockwaves around the world with its salacious allegations about Trump and his supposed ties to Russia.The central allegations, that Trump conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election and that Russia had compromising information on him, were given a veneer of credibility because they originated from a retired British spy, Christopher Steele, who had a solid reputation.But five years later, the credibility of the dossier has significantly diminished.A series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of its central allegations and exposed the unreliability of Steele's sources. They also raise serious questions about the political underpinnings of some key explosive claims about Trump by shedding new light on the involvement of some well-connected Democrats in the dossier, and separate efforts to prod the FBI to investigate ties between Trump's campaign and Russia.These revelations have triggered a reckoning around the Steele dossier, particularly in the wake of two recent indictments secured by John Durham, the special counsel appointed during the Trump administration to investigate the FBI's Russia probe. Durham alleges that Steele's primary source, a US-based foreign policy analyst, repeatedly lied to the FBI about where he got his information.To be clear, multiple US government inquiries uncovered dozens of contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russians, which have since been acknowledged. The candidate himself and his closest advisers even welcomed the Kremlin's interference in the election. Still, none of it added up to the collusion suggested in Steele's memos.Legitimate questions are now being raised about the dossier -- how it was used by Democrats as a political weapon against Trump, how it was handled by the FBI and US intelligence agencies, and how it was portrayed in the mainstream media.Democrats' hidden hand revealed  Trump swiftly rejected Steele's claims and said a ""group of opponents ... put that crap together."" Nearly five years later, it's clearer than ever that he wasn't too far off about the origins of the dossier.Two special counsel investigations, multiple congressional inquiries, civil lawsuits in the US and the United Kingdom, and an internal Justice Department review have now fully unspooled the behind-the-scenes role that some Democrats played in this saga. They paid for the research, funneled information to Steele's sources, and then urged the FBI to investigate Trump's connections to Russia.Mother Jones first revealed the existence of the dossier a few days before the 2016 election, and said the memos were part of an ""opposition research project"" underwritten by Democrats. Nearly a year passed before the full truth came out about the financing: The money flowed from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign to law firm Perkins Coie, to the research company Fusion GPS, and then ultimately to Steele, who got $168,000.(Anti-Trump Republicans initially funded Fusion GPS' research during the 2016 GOP primaries, but the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee picked up the tab before Steele got involved.)But Democratic involvement in Steele's work was much deeper than previously known. Court filings from the Durham inquiry recently revealed that some information in the dossier originated from Charles Dolan, 71, a public relations executive with expertise in Russian affairs who had a decades-long political relationship with the Clinton family. He has not been accused of any crimes.Federal prosecutors said Dolan was in regular contact in 2016 with Steele's primary source Igor Danchenko, 49, a Russian citizen and foreign policy analyst who lives in Virginia. Danchenko was indicted on November 4 for allegedly lying to the FBI about his dealings with Dolan and a fellow Soviet-born expat that he claimed was one of his sources.Danchenko pleaded not guilty last week. In a statement to CNN, his defense attorney Mark Schamel said Durham is pushing a ""false narrative designed to humiliate and slander a renowned expert in business intelligence for political gain."" Schamel also accused Durham of including legally unnecessary information in the 39-page indictment to smear Danchenko.""For the past five years, those with an agenda have sought to expose Mr. Danchenko's identity and tarnish his reputation while undermining U.S. National Security,"" Schamel said. ""...This latest injustice will not stand. We will expose how Mr. Danchenko has been unfairly maligned by these false allegations.""The indictment indirectly connected Dolan to the infamous claim that Russia possessed a compromising tape of Trump with prostitutes in Moscow, which became known as the ""pee tape."" (Trump and Russia both denied the allegations.) According to the Danchenko indictment, in June 2016, Dolan toured the Ritz-Carlton suite where the alleged liaison occurred, and discussed Trump's 2013 visit with hotel staff, but wasn't told about any sexual escapades. It's still unclear where those salacious details that ended up in the dossier came from.Dolan was also indirectly linked in the indictment to still-unverified claims about Russian officials who were allegedly part of the election meddling. The indictment also suggested that Steele's memos exaggerated what Dolan had passed along to Danchenko.The indictment also says the dossier contained a relatively mundane item about Trump campaign infighting that Dolan later told the FBI he actually gleaned from news articles. Prosecutors say Dolan even lied to Danchenko about where he got the gossip, by attributing it to a ""GOP friend"" who was ""a close associate of Trump.""An attorney representing Dolan, Ralph Martin, declined to comment for this story because his client ""is a witness in an ongoing case.""Durham explicitly stated in the Danchenko indictment that the Clinton campaign didn't direct, and wasn't aware of, Dolan's activities regarding the dossier. Clinton has said she only learned about the dossier when it was posted online, two months after the 2016 election. Senior Clinton campaign aides also said they found out about Steele's work from press reports.Clinton's allies prod the FBI  The Danchenko indictment raises new concerns about the circular nature of portions of Steele's work, and how it fit into a larger effort by Democrats to dirty up Trump. Clinton's campaign funded the project, and we now know that much of the material in Steele's memos ended up being mere political gossip. Steele then sent his explosive but unverified findings to the FBI and State Department.While Steele was passing his tips onto the FBI in fall 2016, a Clinton campaign lawyer separately met with a senior FBI official and gave him information about strange cyberactivity between servers at the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia.The lawyer, Michael Sussmann, has since been charged with lying to the FBI during that meeting, for allegedly saying he wasn't providing the dirt on behalf of any client, even though he ultimately billed that time to the Clinton campaign, and also billed them for other work he did on the server issue. Durham says Sussmann repeated this lie during a meeting with CIA officials in February 2017, where he told them about the server theory. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.The indictment says Sussman peddled the same material to a Slate reporter, who published a story right before the election. The story said reputable computer scientists uncovered unusual activity between servers belonging to the Trump Organization and the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, suggesting a secret backchannel.The Trump Organization and Alfa Bank both denied there was a backchannel. The FBI investigated the underlying data and ruled out any improper cyber links by February 2017.But after the Slate article came out, Clinton's campaign went on a PR blitz, tying Trump to Russia. Clinton had already slammed Trump for months, for embracing Russia's interference in the election, which included releasing hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee.Sussmann was a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie, which indirectly hired Steele. Both men separately went to the FBI in 2016 with dirt about Trump, though there's no indication Sussmann knew about the dossier. (A 2019 Justice Department watchdog report pointed out that the FBI routinely accepts information from biased or dubious sources, and then investigators try to independently vet the material.)After he was charged, Sussmann resigned from Perkins Coie. He declined to comment for this story.Rumors, hearsay and fabrications   When the dossier burst into public view, much of the conversation revolved around Steele's résumé: He worked undercover in Moscow, ran the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters, and maintained a network of sources in the country. This lent credibility to his findings, even though nobody, including CNN, was able to confirm the explosive allegations of collusion or the salacious ""pee tape"" claims.In January 2017, CNN broke the story that senior US intelligence officials had briefed Trump and then-President Barack Obama about the dossier. CNN never published the dossier itself, but hours later, BuzzFeed posted the full 35 pages of Steele's memos online for all to see. CNN said the author was ""a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.""That was true. The FBI formalized Steele's role as a confidential informant in 2013. He aided the FBI's groundbreaking corruption case against dozens of FIFA soccer officials in 2015, and he also provided the FBI with reliable information about Russian oligarchs.But the once well-connected British spy had been out of the intelligence services for a while.For starters, we now know that Steele's primary source, Danchenko, wasn't some deep-cover Kremlin insider. He was a DC-based think tank analyst with a Rolodex of Russians.The FBI tracked down Danchenko and interviewed him a few times in 2017 while they scrambled to verify the dossier. Danchenko said the information he gave to Steele was mostly ""hearsay,"" ""just talk,"" ""word of mouth,"" and came from ""conversations he had with friends over beers."" Danchenko also said Steele puffed up the memos and leaned too hard into the raw information he received, according to a bombshell 2019 report from Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz about the Russia probe.Some of Steele's sourcing disintegrates  The Danchenko indictment alleges that he lied to the FBI, and possibly Steele too, about another detail that became central to the dossier: where he heard there was a ""well-developed conspiracy of cooperation"" between Trump and the Kremlin.In interviews with the FBI, Danchenko attributed the information to Sergei Millian, a Belarusian-American businessman who did some real estate work with the Trump Organization. The indictment also says Danchenko sourced the ""pee tape"" story, in part, to Millian. But Millian wasn't the source, Durham says, contradicting press reports from 2017. (Some outlets recently corrected or clarified those reports.)Millian has since said he was ""framed"" by Danchenko and has publicly denied that they ever spoke, though there is no indication in the indictment that Millian ever denied it to the FBI or under oath.""This fraud destroyed my health, life, businesses and turned my American dream into (a) nightmare,"" Millian told CNN in a statement, declining further comment.A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released last year said Millian's behavior during the 2016 election ""resembles activities by a Russian intelligence officer or cooptee."" He has vehemently denied working for the Russian government.Another Russian who Danchenko told the FBI was one of his sources said in a sworn affidavit in a civil case that she wasn't the source for at least one claim that was attributed to her. The woman, publicist Olga Galkina, said she believes Danchenko told the FBI she was his source ""to create more authoritativeness for his work,"" according to court filings.The indictment against Danchenko quotes emails where Galkina told Dolan she is a ""big Hillary fan,"" and hoped to land a job at the State Department after Clinton became president.Taken together, these revelations about Dolan, Millian and Galkina raise grave questions about where Danchenko got his information, or if he perhaps made some of it up.Attorneys for Danchenko didn't respond to CNN's request for an interview.The Durham investigation is ongoing. He continues to use a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, signaling that he might be interested in bringing charges against additional defendants.'Underpinned by poor judgment'   It took five years of criminal investigations, civil cases and congressional reports to pull back the curtain on the flimsiness of the dossier. The big picture really came into focus in 2019 with the release of a Justice Department watchdog report.That report described for the first time Danchenko's many walk-backs in his FBI interviews. It also said FBI agents gave Steele mixed reviews, with some seeing him as a ""person of integrity,"" while others said he had a ""lack of self-awareness"" and was ""underpinned by poor judgment,"" even if he was acting in good faith.The report also said the CIA viewed Steele's material as an ""Internet rumor.""Last year's bipartisan Senate report said ""the tradecraft reflected in the dossier is generally poor relative to (US intelligence community) standards."" The blockbuster 966-page report also raised concerns that some of the material Steele put in his memos was Russian disinformation.These revelations undermined Steele's credibility -- and led to renewed scrutiny and right-wing criticism of how many news outlets, including CNN, covered the dossier story.Efforts to corroborate fall flat   Everyone but Steele talked about his work for nearly five years, but he finally broke his silence in an ABC News interview last month, shortly before Danchenko was arrested. (Steele and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence, declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview.)Steele defended his work and said he was right about three big takeaways from his memos: Russian spy agencies interfered in the 2016 election; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the operation; and the goal was to help Trump and hurt Clinton.He pointed to the US intelligence community's landmark 2017 report that said Russia meddled in the election at Putin's orders to help Trump. US intelligence agencies had examined the dossier but didn't rely on his findings for their report.But Steele's findings on Russian election-meddling, which were ahead of the curve at the time, now seem more like prescient geopolitical observations rather than insider information. Plus, his final and most consequential takeaway -- that Trump's campaign worked hand-in-hand with the Kremlin -- was essentially debunked by special counsel Robert Mueller's sweeping investigation.CNN reported in February 2017 that US investigators had corroborated some of the communications detailed in the dossier, citing multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials.The CNN report said US investigators were able to confirm the time, place and people involved in some of the conversations between foreign nationals mentioned by Steele. The story said CNN couldn't confirm if those conversations were about Trump, and the sources told CNN that the corroborated information had nothing to do with the salacious claims in the dossier.The sources also told CNN that the corroboration gave investigators ""greater confidence"" in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier, which the FBI was still actively investigating at the time.Two years later, the Justice Department watchdog said only limited information was corroborated from the dossier relating to ""time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available.""Horowitz's watchdog report, released in December 2019, also said much of the material in the dossier about Trump and his campaign ""could not be corroborated"" and that ""certain allegations were inaccurate or inconsistent"" with subsequent FBI findings.But Horowitz said the FBI determined that Steele's big-picture conclusions about Russian meddling were ""consistent with known efforts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections.""What's right? What's wrong?   Looking at the big picture, Steele was right that Russia used ""trusted agents of influence"" to target Trump's inner circle. And he was correct to suspect there were secret contacts between Trump aides and Russian officials, even though Trump denied any Russian ties. But Steele was wrong about so many of the key details.Despite a worldwide hunt for the Trump ""kompromat,"" no tapes ever emerged, and the Danchenko indictment puts the source of that underlying claim into doubt.There is no proof of something in the dossier that would've been a smoking gun for collusion -- that Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen went to Prague in 2016 to coordinate with Russian officials about their anti-Clinton hacking efforts. The watchdog report said the FBI concluded that these claims ""were not true."" Even after Cohen turned on Trump and started helping Mueller, and implicated his former boss in an illegal campaign finance scheme, Cohen always denied the Prague allegations.The dossier said Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and foreign policy adviser Carter Page led the collusion efforts. But this was never verified by any government investigations. Mueller found that both men had extensive contacts with Russian agents, but he couldn't verify that Page met with the specific Kremlin officials as alleged in the dossier.The Mueller report said there wasn't evidence of a criminal conspiracy to collude.Five years on, Steele continues to defend his work. He told ABC News that ""the evidence suggests"" there was collusion, that he believes Cohen traveled to Prague after all, and that the compromising tape of Trump with Russian prostitutes ""probably"" exists.""I stand by the work we did, the sources that we had, and the professionalism which we applied to it,"" Steele said in the interview with ABC News.Origins of the Russia probe  Democratic officials, the media and Internet conspiracy theorists initially hyped Steele's work. But as his credibility waned, Trump started exaggerating Steele's influence, and pushed the lie that the dossier triggered ""the entire Russia probe.""In truth, the dossier played a remarkably limited role in the Russia investigation.Four US government reports concluded that the probe began in July 2016, two months before the FBI team handling the inquiry even learned about the dossier.(After a lengthy review, Horowitz said there was a legal basis to open the Russia probe, and that the process was free of political bias. However, Durham publicly rebuked Horowitz and said he disagreed with some of Horowitz's conclusions, leading to criticism that his own work is politically motivated.)Mueller's team interviewed Steele, but largely ignored the dossier as they found dozens of links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller's report didn't say all that much about the dossier, and he didn't attribute any findings to Steele.And there's no indication that the dossier influenced Mueller's successful criminal prosecutions against six Trump campaign associates: Manafort, Cohen, Roger Stone, Rick Gates, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos.But the dossier did play a major role in the investigation into Page, the lower-level Trump foreign policy adviser, and helped the FBI secure a warrant to wiretap him after he left the campaign in September 2016.Tainted FBI wiretaps  The fallout from the dossier was largely contained to the Page surveillance. But when internal investigators looked under the hood, they found catastrophic issues.Before the dossier, investigators already considered applying for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to wiretap Page's communications, but they weren't sure if they could establish probable cause. The dossier's explosive claims about Page's alleged meetings during his recent trip to Moscow ""pushed it over"" the line, a lawyer involved in the case told the Justice Department watchdog.The FBI included snippets of Steele's reporting in the FISA application, along with other information, like details of Page's previous interactions with Russian spies, and the fact that he suggested to an FBI informant that he had an ""open checkbook"" from the Kremlin. The secretive FISA court approved the warrant in October 2016, as well as three subsequent renewal requests, meaning Page was wiretapped for about one year.In April 2017, CNN was first to report that the FBI included some material from the dossier in the FISA applications. The article said prosecutors would only have done this ""after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation,"" according to officials familiar with the process.It's now clear that this level of verification never materialized. The watchdog report said Steele's claims about Page ""remained uncorroborated"" when the wiretaps ended in 2017.Page was never charged with any crimes, and Mueller said his investigation ""did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government"" to meddle in the election, which was a far cry from the FBI's initial assertions in FISA applications that Page ""is an agent of a foreign power"" who was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian Government.""The inspector general examined the FBI's handling of the FISA applications and found that there were widespread mistakes, omissions and errors that deeply undermined the integrity of the process. In response, the Justice Department declared that the final two FISA warrants against Page were legally invalid.But even Durham, who has been accused of cherry-picking an unfair narrative to undermine the Russia probe, hasn't said in his recent indictments, spanning 66 pages, that the FBI or Mueller ever relied on Steele for anything beyond the Page surveillance.Partial vindication for Trump    Critics of the Russia probe -- conservative pundits, Republican lawmakers and Trump himself -- took a victory lap after the inspector general blasted the Page FISA applications.That's because the inspector general's report confirmed what many of them had argued all along, including in a highly disputed memo from GOP Rep. Devin Nunes: That there were systemic problems with the FBI surveillance of someone tied to the Trump, and the Steele dossier was improperly used to influence part of the Russia probe.But the report refuted the more outlandish conspiracy theories that Trump, Nunes and other Republicans pushed about the Russia probe. The report said the FISA process, while flawed, wasn't intentionally abused and wasn't politically biased. And the report debunked Trump's lie that the FBI planted spies in his campaign.The latest Durham indictments also injected new life into Russia probe skeptics.After wall-to-wall coverage of the Steele dossier, public opinion was quickly locked in on the question of collusion. Many Democrats clung to hope that the dossier was true. Most Republicans denounced it as a deep state hoax. Post-Mueller polling found that about half of Americans believed Trump was guilty of collusion.Mueller and a bipartisan Senate inquiry concluded that Trump's team welcomed Russian help, and tried to coordinate on a few fronts, but it didn't come to fruition.But so much suspicion was fueled by Trump's massive cover-up about Russia.Trump and his team systematically lied about almost every aspect of the Russia probe. (At the start, they falsely denied any contacts with Russians.) After so many of their denials were disproved, they repeatedly shifted their story. Trump repeatedly undermined and obstructed Mueller's investigation.All the while, Trump heaped praise on Putin. He infamously took Putin's side at the 2018 Helsinki summit by agreeing with Putin's lie that Russia didn't try to help Trump win in 2016, leading many to wonder if Trump was compromised after all.",0
70," (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris said Thursday she does not feel misused or underused in her role as vice president, following CNN reporting that many in the vice president's circle believe she is being sidelined and that key West Wing aides are exasperated by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus from Harris and her staff. ""We're getting things done, and we're doing it together,"" Harris told ABC in an interview that aired on ""Good Morning America.""Harris pointed to the President signing one of his biggest legislative victories -- the bipartisan infrastructure package -- into law on Monday, saying: ""This was a good week.""""I am very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished. But I am also absolutely, absolutely clear-eyed that there is a lot more to do and we're going to get it done,"" Harris said. Earlier this week, several top White House officials defended Harris, including press secretary Jen Psaki, who described the vice president as a ""key partner"" to the President. CNN reported on Sunday that key West Wing aides have largely thrown up their hands at Harris and her staff -- deciding there simply isn't time to deal with them right now as Biden faces urgent legislative and political concerns. At the same time, many in the vice president's circle are fuming that Harris is not being adequately prepared or positioned in her role, and the vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically.Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a longtime friend of Harris, told CNN: ""It is natural that those of us who know her know how much more helpful she can be than she is currently being asked to be. That's where the frustration is coming from.""In the ABC interview on Thursday, Harris did not say whether Biden had told her if he was planning on running for reelection, and said she and the President were ""absolutely not"" discussing 2024 yet. Harris also dismissed the President's low approval ratings, saying: ""Polls, they go up, they go down. But I think what is most important is that we remain consistent with what we need to do to deal with the issues that we're presented with.""Harris also called dealing with record inflation ""one of the highest priorities"" for herself and Biden.""It's real and it's rough,"" she said, citing rising prices for groceries and gas. She highlighted actions the administration has been taking to try to ease supply chain issues and lower costs for American families. Biden announced last month the Port of Los Angeles would move to 24/7 service, bringing it into line with operations at the Port of Long Beach, which was already working on a 24/7 schedule. Those two ports handle 40% of container traffic in the US. The administration has also taken other actions to attempt to alleviate issues at the nation's ports, waterways and freight networks.""We're seeing great results,"" Harris said.In addition to the short-term actions, Harris said in the long term, the administration is working to bring down the cost of living. She said the new bipartisan infrastructure law as well as the second part of Biden's economic agenda -- a sweeping package to expand the nation's social safety net -- would help achieve that goal.",0
71," (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris' communications director, Ashley Etienne, is leaving the Biden administration to pursue ""other opportunities,"" a White House official tells CNN. ""Ashley is a valued member of the vice president's team, who has worked tirelessly to advance the goals of this administration,"" the official said. ""She is leaving the office in December to pursue other opportunities.""Etienne's exit comes after CNN detailed significant tension between West Wing aides and the vice president's office. CNN reported that several people on Harris' staff had started to reach out to contacts to say they're looking to leave, according to sources who've gotten calls. Vanity Fair was first to report Etienne's departure.Etienne's exit has been a long time coming, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.  One source said Etienne ""was not a good fit"" for Harris' office and did not play a sufficiently active role in crafting a communications strategy for Harris' topsy-turvy first year in office.Both sources said there are no immediate plans to replace Etienne as Harris' communications director.Prior to joining the Biden administration, Etienne was a senior adviser to the Biden presidential campaign and a communications professional for a number of elected officials in Washington, including then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and then-President Barack Obama.  Harris has been dogged with messaging challenges since her unsuccessful presidential campaign, and has at times publicly fumbled the White House's message.Those public missteps have included drawing the ire of key moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin over her comments made on local West Virginia television about the American Rescue Plan and garnering criticism over an answer on why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border. Many in the vice president's circle told CNN this fall that she's not being adequately prepared or positioned, and instead is being sidelined. The vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically. And those around her remain wary of even hinting at future political ambitions, with President Joe Biden's team highly attuned to signs of disloyalty, particularly from the vice president.Several sources speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation more frankly have told CNN Harris' staff has repeatedly failed her and left her exposed, and family members have often had an informal say within her office. Reports of disarray within Harris' office earlier this summer and again this fall have sent the White House into damage control on more than one occasion. Earlier this week, following CNN's report of the dysfunction within the vice president's office, the White House defended Harris, calling her a ""key partner"" to the President.""The President selected the vice president because -- to serve as his running mate -- because he felt she was exactly the person he wanted to have by his side to govern the country,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a White House briefing on Monday. House Democratic Whip Rep. James Clyburn, who had private conversations with Biden during his vice president selection process, downplayed the recent reporting about Harris' office and Etienne's exit. ""I'm always concerned when I read headlines that are not complimentary ... but headlines are headlines,"" the South Carolina Democrat told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront"" Thursday evening.He continued: ""People leave jobs all the time. I've been a part of transitions myself at the state level. And I know that within the first several months -- sometimes it takes a year -- that people may find out this is not exactly for me. So these things tend to happen.""The vice president's office also hired additional communications advisers earlier this fall, including a crisis communications specialist who is expected to serve in a temporary capacity for several months. In late September, the vice president's office hired two communications veterans -- Lorraine Voles, the crisis communications specialist who previously worked for Hillary Clinton and Al Gore, and Adam Frankel, a former Obama speechwriter -- to focus their efforts on ""organizational development, strategic communications and long-term planning,"" according to the White House. Harris on Thursday morning downplayed concerns over her role and stressed unity with the President. ""This was a good week. And this week, when we got the bipartisan infrastructure act passed and signed by the President, makes a statement about all of the hard work that has gone into it. ... We're getting things done and we're doing it together,"" she told George Stephanopoulos in a brief interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""Asked if she felt misused, Harris said, ""No, I don't,"" laughing.This story has been updated with additional reporting.",0
72," (CNN)Potential pay outs of up to $450,000 to migrant families separated at the US-Mexico border are the latest political flashpoint in the Republican criticism of President Joe Biden's immigration policy -- and the political back-and-forth has put a tense relationship under further strain.The debate has not only put the Biden administration in a politically precarious position, but more acutely, Biden's response to the payments has stressed the already-fragile relationship between the government and families, according to immigrant advocate groups who work directly with them. After Biden swatted down media reports about financial compensation for those separated under the previous administration, the Justice Department told attorneys representing families who are seeking damages that settlement will not be that high, sparking confusion among attorneys and advocates about the Biden administration's position on the matter.""It does not help when there's a lack of clarity about what the federal government is willing to do for the families,"" said Nan Schivone, the legal director at Justice in Motion, which helps locate separated families.""When the news broke, it was not helpful because it sowed a lot of seeds of confusion about the willingness of the government to care for the families and atone for the past unlawful actions, the unlawful actions of the past administration,"" she added.Republicans have lambasted the administration for considering financial compensation for separated families, arguing in part that it should not exceed what's provided to the families of fallen soldiers. In a nearly four-hour congressional hearing this week, at least five Republican senators repeatedly raised the ongoing settlement negotiations in questioning of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who deferred to the Justice Department, which is handling the settlement negotiations. Mayorkas is the chair of the family reunification task force ordered by Biden. In recent months, tensions have also flared between the Biden administration and allies over the administration's border policy, but concern over the handling of remedies for separated families puts one of the most sensitive matters at the forefront. Behind the scenes, families at the center of the damages cases are still reeling over the moment more than three years ago when they were separated from their loved ones and are waiting for the Biden administration to execute on its promises. ""It's only been words. I can't have confidence in something like that,"" Daniel Paz, a father who was separated from his 7-year-old daughter at the US-Mexico border in May 2018, told CNN, in Spanish.  Paz reunited with his daughter, Angie, after seven weeks. And in June 2018, the Trump administration ended the so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy, in which the Justice Department initiated criminal prosecutions of every adult illegally crossing the border.Paz still gets emotional recalling the moment when officials took his daughter, along with other children, while at a border facility. ""The kids were yelling. ... We begged for them not to do it,"" Paz, a member of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, said. ""It was like a horror movie."" Paz, an asylee, is seeking damages from the federal government. More than 3,000 children were separated from their families at the US-Mexico border under former President Donald Trump and attorneys are still trying to reach the parents of 270 migrant children, according to a November court filing in an ongoing family separation case. For parents who experienced their children being taken from them, with no hint of where they were going, it's been difficult to trust the federal government, regardless of who's president. ""These families have very little reason to trust the US government based on their experience when they were separated and deported,"" said Wendy Young, president of Kids In Need of Defense, which has worked closely with separated families. ""You can't really underestimate the amount of trauma that these families have gone through. That fundamentally makes them very nervous and skittish,"" she added. KIND recently partnered with the United Nations refugee agency to target outreach to families and field questions or concerns they may have. Karla Emeli Portillo Molina is among those parents who were deported without their children. She was separated from her 14-year-old son in 2017 and sent back to El Salvador months later without him. ""I was crying. I became depressed. I didn't want to leave without my son,"" she told CNN in Spanish. She was reunited with her son, now 18, in California this year. The expediency with which her paperwork was completed and approved for her to reunite gave her confidence in the Biden administration. Lawsuits have stemmed from the ""zero tolerance"" policy and separation of families. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class action lawsuit in 2019 seeking damages for the toll the separations took on families, and attorneys representing families have filed separate claims. ""The statute doesn't have an immigration status exception and the federal government often settles lawsuits whether person is a citizen or non-citizen,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director at the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, adding that migrants can legally apply for asylum either at or between ports of entry at the US-Mexico border. ""Harm is harm. And Congress is clear you can't brutalize someone and then say, 'Well, they were here illegally.' The fact is these were asylum seekers,"" he told reporters Thursday, noting that there's no settlement deal on the table right now. The Biden administration's task force, meanwhile, has made some inroads, reunifying 60 families, with more anticipated. ""Establishing trust with families who were intentionally and cruelly separated under the prior administration's Zero-Tolerance policy is a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security, and is essential to the effort to reunify those families,"" a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. ""DHS recognizes the intense trauma these families have experienced, and is working closely with non-governmental organizations to take this trauma into account in the reunification process,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Mayorkas has previously met with families separated at the border under the last administration. That trauma extends to children, including Angie, Paz's daughter.""She doesn't play like she used to,"" he told CNN in Spanish. ""Now, she's worried with adult problems."" ",0
73," (CNN)The White House on Monday defended Vice President Kamala Harris as a ""key partner"" to President Joe Biden following CNN reporting that key West Wing aides are exasperated by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus from Harris and her staff, while many in the vice president's circle believe Harris is being sidelined. ""The President selected the vice president because -- to serve as his running mate -- because he felt she was exactly the person he wanted to have by his side to govern the country,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a White House briefing. Psaki continued: ""She is a key partner, she's a bold leader, and she is somebody who has taken on incredibly important assignments, whether it is addressing the root causes of migration at the Northern Triangle or taking on a core cause of democracy in voting rights.""""There's been a lot of reports out there and they don't reflect his view or our experience with the vice president,"" Psaki said. CNN reported on Sunday that key West Wing aides have largely thrown up their hands at Harris and her staff -- deciding there simply isn't time to deal with them right now, especially at a moment when Biden faces quickly multiplying legislative and political concerns. At the same time, many in the vice president's circle are fuming that Harris is not being adequately prepared or positioned, and the vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically.White House chief of staff Ron Klain also expressed confidence in Harris on Monday evening, telling CNN's Anderson Cooper on ""AC360"" that she's a ""magnificent"" vice president. ""She is delivering for the American people every day. She's doing a fantastic job, whether it's on domestic matters or international matters,"" Klain said. ""I'm delighted to be her next-door neighbor in the West Wing. I have a chance to talk with her almost every day she's in the White House, and I can tell you she is doing a phenomenal job as vice president.""Psaki declined to weigh in on a possible future run from Harris for the Democratic nomination. Harris could be just a year away from launching a presidential campaign, given doubts throughout the political world that Biden will actually go through with a reelection bid in 2024, something he's pledged to do publicly and privately.""I know that the President relies on the vice president for her advice for her counsel. She's somebody who is not only taking on issues that are challenging; she's not looking for a cushy role here,"" Psaki said, without denying CNN's reporting or answering directly when asked whether she's heard unhappiness among the vice president or key members of her staff.Psaki added that the President is looking forward to seeing Harris on the road this week, touting the bipartisan Infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law Monday. Harris praised Biden at the signing ceremony. ""We would not be here today were it not for your leadership, Mr. President,"" she said. ""From the very start, you welcomed Democrats, independents and Republicans to meet with us in the Oval Office. You welcomed ideas. You welcomed debate, all in the service of getting this bill done.""Before Harris spoke, the announcer skipped over her, instead announcing an Iron Workers organizer as Harris stood at the podium. ""In a moment,"" Harris said in response, laughing along with the crowd.Harris' supporters have bemoaned her lack of visibility and opportunity for her to tout the administration's successes.""She is a wonderful messenger. But it has to be clear, concise and consistent,"" Donna Brazile, a frequent outside adviser to Harris, previously told CNN. ""Don't make her a creature of the Beltway. Let her out.""This story has been updated with additional information. ",0
74," (CNN)President Joe Biden underwent his annual physical Friday morning at Walter Reed Medical Center, his first such appointment since he was inaugurated as the oldest first-term president in US history.Afterward, his physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor wrote in a memo Biden ""remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.""The doctor, who has been with the President since he served as vice president, singled out two areas of ""observation"" he set aside for detailed investigation: an ""increasing frequency and severity of 'throat clearing' and coughing during speaking engagements"" and the President's ambulatory gait, or walking abnormality, which O'Connor said was ""perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago."" Both have been noticeable elements of Biden's public appearances since taking office. In a detailed, six-page summary of Biden's health, O'Connor said X-rays showed Biden has arthritis of his spine and normal wear and tear damage for someone of his age. The doctor characterized that damage as moderate to severe, but said it was not severe enough to warrant any specific treatment. He wrote it would help account for some of Biden's recent stiffness and clumsy gait. An ""extremely detailed neurologic exam"" was ""reassuring,"" O'Connor wrote, and showed no evidence of a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's.Biden also has a condition known as hiatal hernia, which causes him to have reflux -- something O'Connor said could account for his more frequent throat clearing.The document contained a detailed accounting of the physical exam, including his height of 5 feet 11.65 inches; his weight of 184 pounds; and his blood pressure of 120/70. Biden does not drink or use tobacco and works out five times a week, according to the report. ""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,"" O'Connor wrote in his summary.Biden received a routine colonoscopy Friday while at Walter Reed. The process, which required anesthesia, meant that he temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman to assume presidential power for 85 minutes Friday morning.As he left Walter Reed, Biden said he ""had a great physical and a great House of Representatives vote,"" alluding to the House passing his Build Back Better bill on Friday morning.The last extensive update on Biden's medical state came in December 2019, when the doctor he eventually recruited to serve as White House physician described him as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, hasn't released a full report on his health since.Biden is not behind in releasing medical information compared to his recent predecessors, who waited a full year before undergoing a physical and authorizing details to be released publicly.The latest update on Biden's health came after he, then-president-elect, fractured his foot in November while playing with his dog. In February, Biden's physician said the foot fractures ""are completely healed.""Presidents are not required to publicly disclose results of their annual check-ups but have done so to be transparent and assure the American people in the face of questions about their state of health. Presidents, however, have also hidden their illnesses, the severity of their illness, or medical treatments.Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009 and the White House physician, wrote the three-page medical summary Biden's presidential campaign released nearly two years ago. The 2019 summary showed Biden was being treated for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, or AFib -- an irregular heartbeat that O'Connor said Biden experiences no symptoms of. He was taking Crestor to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as Eliquis to prevent blood clots, Nexium for acid reflux, and Allegra and a nasal spray for seasonal allergies.The most significant medical event in Biden's history, O'Connor wrote, was when Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988. He was serving in the Senate at the time. During surgery, doctors found a second aneurysm that had not bled, which they also treated. While in the hospital after that surgery, Biden suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Doctors at the time inserted an ""inferior vena cava filter,"" which would prevent future blood clots from reaching the heart and lungs and treated him with an oral anti-coagulant for several months.Biden also had his gallbladder removed in 2003, and according to O'Connor he has had multiple surgeries and physical treatments for orthopedic injuries and sports medicine. Biden also has had several non-melanoma skin cancer lesions surgically removed. This story has been updated with additional information. ",0
75,"Washington (CNN)President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday that he is mulling a US diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing.""It's something we're considering,"" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office following a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.A senior administration official told CNN on Wednesday that Biden is not expected to attend the upcoming Olympics in China this February and that his administration is on the verge of implementing a diplomatic boycott of the games. The President has not signed off on having no government officials attend, the senior administration official cautioned on Wednesday, but discussions regarding the matter have all leaned in that direction. The topic of the Olympics and Biden's attendance did not come up during his three-and-a-half hour meeting Monday night with Chinese President Xi Jinping.However, the two leaders engaged in a ""healthy debate"" on a number of issues, according to a senior Biden administration official present for the discussions. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon that the decision to consider a boycott of the Olympics ""doesn't say anything"" about the Biden-Xi meeting. ""(W)e've said from ... the beginning of this administration, as it relates to how we engage with China, that we see it through the prism of competition, not conflict,"" Psaki added.Psaki repeated the administration's serious concerns about China's human rights abuses, adding that ""certainly, there are a range of factors as we look at what our presence would be.""When pressed for more information about what a potential diplomatic boycott would entail, and what that would mean for athletes, Psaki said she didn't have an update about what the US presence would be.Democratic and Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have advocated for a diplomatic boycott in protest of China's human rights abuses. Some Republicans have even suggested no American athletes attend either, but the official said a full boycott is unlikely right now.When asked whether Biden had been in touch with congressional lawmakers about the prospective boycott, Psaki said the White House is ""in regular touch at a range of levels with members of Congress about a range of issues, including the relationship with China and including an issue like this."" Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US and allies are in ""active conversations"" about how to approach the upcoming Winter Olympics in China.Blinken, appearing virtually at the New York Times DealBook Summit, was asked whether he thinks American athletes should participate since he has said in the past that China is involved in genocide, given its policies toward Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province.""We are talking to -- to allies, to partners, to countries around the world about how they're thinking about the games, how they're thinking about participation,"" Blinken said. ""It's an active conversation. We're coming -- we're coming up on the games, but let me leave it at that for today.""",0
76," (CNN)President Joe Biden, reconvening a summit of North American leaders at the White House on Thursday, sought cross-border agreement on migration, Covid-19 and economic integration, even as his guests voiced concerns over what they say are protectionist trade policies left over from Biden's predecessor.""We can meet all of the challenges if we just take the time to speak with one another,"" Biden said as he met in the East Room with the leaders of Canada and Mexico. ""As leaders, we share an innate understanding that our diversity is an enormous strength.""The main sticking points between the men center on Biden's proposed tax credits for American-made electric vehicles, which are included in the major social and climate spending plan currently making its way through Congress. Canada has argued the proposed credits could violate a new North American trade agreement.The White House holds a different view, and the topic was expected to arise during the lengthy talks between the leaders at Thursday's gathering.It's the first such summit -- which have come to be known as the ""Three Amigos"" -- since 2016, reviving a forum shunned by former President Donald Trump. It came a few weeks after Biden reopened US land borders to fully vaccinated travelers, ending a nearly 20-month closure that had caused tensions with both nations.Before he met jointly with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Biden sat down with each leader individually to discuss bilateral issues. They did not hold a joint press conference, unlike the previous eight North American Leaders summits held since 2005.Welcoming Trudeau to the Oval Office, Biden offered praise for what he called ""one of the easiest relationships you can have as an American president, and one of the best.""With López Obrador, Biden hailed the two nations' ""different and emerging relationship, that is borne out of mutual respect.""""Mr. President,"" Biden went on, ""we no longer use language like 'Our friends from the South.' You are an equal, we're equal countries, and that's what I like about you.""All three leaders entered the talks hoping for a more united front on economic and security matters as global competition from China and other regions scales up. Supply chain disruptions have heightened the nations' desire to create more resilient manufacturing at home.The leaders were planning to announce a new group focused on supply chain resiliency, pledge to reduce emissions like methane and reaffirm support for labor protections included in the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal signed during the Trump administration.The leaders also hope to rebuild relationships that had gone dormant in the previous administration, including a high-level security dialogue.Yet as Biden works to promote the landmark infrastructure law he signed this week, some of the provisions included in a larger climate and social spending plan are causing consternation among the United States' neighbors.Specifically, proposed electric vehicle tax credits included in the ""Build Back Better"" plan would favor US manufacturers, causing concerns about protectionist policies. Trudeau and Mexican officials have voiced concern about the proposed tax credits.Pressed by reporters, Biden said alongside Trudeau the two leaders were ""going to talk about"" tax incentives for electric vehicles, but pointed out the provision ""hasn't even passed the House yet.""During a daily White House press briefing, the President's press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the proposed electric vehicle tax credit ""is an opportunity to help consumers in this country.""Migration was another central topic of discussion, though ahead of time Biden's advisers said the focus would be on developing a regional approach to the issue and not specifically about the US southern border.One official said Biden hoped to ""lock arms"" with Canada and Mexico to address displacement issues they acknowledge will not wane anytime soon. They hope to address root causes like lack of job opportunities and the effects of climate change.Other issues have caused some tension among neighbors, including Enbridge's Line 5 oil pipeline, which the state of Michigan wants to shut down, and Mexico's overhaul of its electricity industry.But the leaders still put on a cooperative face as the ""Three Amigos"" format was restored, including an announcement on Covid-19 vaccine donations. Earlier this year, the United States lent doses to both countries, and on Thursday they ""returned"" them by donating millions of vaccines to countries in the Western Hemisphere.They also agreed to build on efforts to compile regional pandemic preparedness plans and discuss the best ways to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine in Latin America.This story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.",0
77," (CNN)President Joe Biden asked the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday to ""immediately"" investigate whether illegal activity by oil and gas companies is pushing up gas prices as he searches for a way to reduce pain at the pump.The move isn't likely to have an immediate effect on the price consumers are paying for gas, which has recently soared as post-pandemic demand outpaces supply. But Biden is seeking ways to show he is working to bring prices down, and the FTC's findings could help in the long run if they find wrongdoing.In a letter to the FTC commissioner Lina Khan, Biden cited ""mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies"" and said the agency must probe whether anything illegal is occurring to drive up prices.""The bottom line is this: gasoline prices at the pump remain high, even though oil and gas companies' costs are declining,"" he wrote.He cited an ""unexplained large gap"" between the price of unfinished gasoline and average prices at the pump as evidence of potential wrongdoing. And he noted industry profits have increased massively, while companies like ExxonMobil make plans for stock buybacks and dividends for stockholders.""I do not accept hard-working Americans paying more for gas because of anti-competitive or otherwise potentially illegal conduct. I therefore ask that the Commission further examine what is happening with oil and gas markets, and that you bring all of the Commission's tools to bear if you uncover any wrongdoing,"" he wrote.Biden did not cite any specific evidence of illegal activity. He had asked the FTC earlier this fall to closely monitor potential illegal activity in oil and gas markets, but his letter Wednesday made a direct call to investigate.High gas prices are among the most frustrating phenomena for any White House because of a president's limited ability to bring them down. At the same time, they have the ability to inflict significant political damage as costs are borne by nearly every family.The current surge has been spurred by more demand as drivers return to the road following an easing of Covid-19 lockdowns. Biden has worked to convince the oil producing nations of OPEC to increase supply, but they have largely rebuffed him.He hasn't ruled out releasing barrels from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but has been cautioned by administration officials that it would have only a limited effect on prices.At the same time, Biden has worked to enact policies that would reduce American dependence on fossil fuels. He plans to travel Wednesday to Michigan to tour an electric vehicle plant and tout new funding for charging stations contained in the large infrastructure law he signed on Monday.",0
78," (CNN)Covid-19 booster shots were authorized for all adults Friday, offering the Biden administration a fresh chance at simplifying a message that many internally believe has been far too confusing.There has been deep frustration inside the administration over the complicated messaging surrounding booster shots, with several officials conceding to CNN that the restrictions on who should get one and when have only spurred confusion when it was clear immunity wanes for all age groups.They hope that will end now that the US Food and Drug Administration has expanded authorization for Pfizer and Moderna vaccine boosters to all adults, an opportunity officials view to correct the messaging. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee will meet Friday to discuss expanding booster eligibility. Boosters could officially be administered to all adults after CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signs off on a recommendation.""It will be easier to communicate the urgency and availability to all populations, including the most vulnerable, by simplifying this and making everyone eligible,"" one senior health official told CNN.""Finally, they got there,"" another official added.Once the decisions were made, the message will be: If you are fully vaccinated, you still need a booster shot.As cases of Covid surge in parts of Europe, US officials have been anxiously awaiting a similar uptick as temperatures drop in many parts of the country. Rates in the US have increased in recent days, causing fresh concern that a seasonal spike is imminent.Some of President Joe Biden's advisers have viewed the spike of cases in Europe as further reason to press forward with a plan to offer boosters to all adults, seeing it as getting ahead of what is likely to come in the United States.While the prospect of a winter surge has long been included in the administration's Covid planning, some advisers feel boosters could help mitigate the effects. While publicly the White House said it was waiting for the process to proceed to expand boosters to all adults, privately some on Biden's team were encouraged when individual states began expanding eligibility themselves. One official said it was a misstep on the part of the advisory committee to wait this long.The latest states to get ahead of the federal regulators were Utah and Massachusetts, following several others who determined all adults should get third shots.""CDC speaks Latin. I can't figure out who's eligible, who's not eligible. If you smoked while you were in high school, back in the 1970s, you're eligible,"" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said at a news conference on Thursday, urging all adults to get a booster if they meet the timing requirement. ""I think if you haven't been vaccinated in more than six months, now's the time to get the booster.""A new surge of Covid cases around the winter holidays would further disrupt a festive season already complicated by high gas prices and supply chain issues. Biden has received personal assurances from the CEOs of major shippers and box store retailers that they will be able to operate and fully stock their shelves this year. But the lingering effects of the pandemic will still be felt, from mask requirements on planes to higher prices for food to shortages of certain goods.Biden and his team are loathe to recommend against indoor holiday gatherings for another year, mindful that Americans are growing increasingly exhausted from pandemic-related restrictions.So, too, are Biden and his team mindful of not signaling an end to the pandemic after prematurely declaring ""freedom from the virus"" over the summer. A subsequent surge due to the highly contagious Delta variant caused a return of mask requirements and closures, and led many Americans to sour on how Biden was handling the crisis.Once a bright spot in his poll numbers, more Americans now disapprove of Biden's handling of the pandemic (49%) than approve (47%), according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week.The downward trajectory maps closely with the period when cases began rising again over the summer after it seemed to many the pandemic had ended. And it mimics an overall political weakening for Biden, whose approval rating stands at 44%, according to a CNN poll of polls.Biden's political advisers believe ending the Covid pandemic -- and, by extension, easing its associated economic pressures -- is the most central imperative to improving the President's standing.",0
79," (CNN)President Joe Biden on Thursday signed three bipartisan bills into law aimed at supporting the nation's law enforcement and first responders, as well as the communities they serve.""Today's investment and the bills I'm about to sign share goals of law enforcement and first responders: be the protectors and the partners our communities need,"" he said.He went on to tout his administration's efforts to invest in community policing and training programs for community-based partners, including new grants from the Department of Justice to help build legitimacy and trust, address gun violence and combat domestic extremism.He thanked Attorney General Merrick Garland for ""leading these efforts.""The COPS Counseling Act, he said, helps support mental health resources for law enforcement.""Every day our nation's police answer the call, confront scenes that can take a toll to them as well -- and even traumatize,"" he said, drawing parallels to the military, adding that it is an obligation to help law enforcement recover from the ""invisible wounds"" that cause mental health issues.The Protect America's First Responders Act, Biden said, helps those disabled or killed in the line of duty, including firefighters, EMTs and other law enforcement. It includes disability and education benefits and expands those who are eligible.""This bill restores our sense of valor,"" he said.Biden also signed the Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila Federal Officers and Employees Protection Act.""It sends a message to drug cartels, terrorists, and criminals -- wherever they operate -- if you attack our agents, you will not escape our justice,"" he said.He also made a plea to Congress to ""come together"" and pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, negotiations on which stalled out earlier this year.""That's next,"" he said.",0
80," (CNN)Now that President Joe Biden has signed his highly sought-after infrastructure bill into law, it is time for Democrats to go out and sell the accomplishment.Building Back Together, the pro-Biden outside organization that formed earlier this year with the White House's blessing, is starting that work with a $10 million ad campaign to tout the infrastructure proposal across the country, including in Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all states with key Senate races in 2022. If Congress can pass the companion social spending bill currently being negotiated on Capitol Hill, the group plans to use the campaign to tout the possible the legislative accomplishment.The group's first ad of the campaign -- titled ""Long Time Coming"" -- features video of the bipartisan bill signing and focuses on how the law will address supply chain issues in the United States, fix decaying roads and bridges and replace lead pipes to provide clean drinking water.The ad campaign will run through Thanksgiving and air spots in battleground states during highly watched television events, like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and multiple Thanksgiving Day NFL clashes, including Las Vegas Raiders vs. Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears vs. Detroit Lions.""Our goal is to make sure that folks know exactly what has been delivered to them,"" said Danielle Melfi, executive director of Building Back Together. ""We want to make sure we are taking that agenda straight to the American people, not wasting any time to communicate about this president delivering.""Building Back Together also plans to put up billboards near infrastructure projects that were made possible by the newly passed legislation.Biden signed the infrastructure bill on Monday, delivering on his campaign promise to strike a bipartisan deal that addresses the county's aging roads, bridges, and waterways. The President signed the bill in a rare gathering at the White House where he was flanked by both Democrats and Republicans who voted for the bill. The White House now turns its focus to passing a broader social spending bill that has yet to garner the same kind of support from both parties.The legislative win comes days after the Democratic Party suffered a significant defeat in the Virginia gubernatorial election and narrowly won a closer-than-expected race for New Jersey's top executive position. The struggles are seen as warning signs for Democrats headed into the 2022 election cycle. History shows that the party in power -- Democrats control the White House, Senate and House -- often loses seats in the subsequent midterms. Biden's approval has also slumped in recent months. A CNN Poll of Polls, an average of the six most recent nonpartisan, national surveys of adults on Biden's job approval, found that 45% of Americans approve how he is handling his job, compared to 52% of Americans who disapprove of the job he is doing.Top operatives throughout the Democratic Party now believe that selling the infrastructure bill will be critical if the party will be able to stave off historic trends and have a stronger than expected showing in the 2022 midterms. Republican have looked to counter that messaging by highlighting concerns around inflation and a rising cost of living, while Democrats argue passing the two spending bills are the best way to curb rising prices.""We're confident that we're able to make a very clear argument that this is going to lower your costs,"" said Matt Barreto, a senior adviser for Building Back Together. ""People are aware and concerned about costs today, and it is something that infrastructure is, first of all, immediately can start addressing... and the Build Back Better Act is going to continue that.""Biden himself has acknowledged the importance of passing these bills, telling Democrats in the House of Representatives in his final push to pass the bills that he didn't ""think it's hyperbole to say that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week.""""In less than a year, voters will have to rehire the Democratic majority or hire a new Republican one - and Democrats building roads, rebuilding bridges and expanding internet can become a centerpiece of that performance review,"" said Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist. ""If anyone has doubts about the politics of this, you need to only remember how desperate Donald Trump was to do what Joe Biden just got done.""And Building Back Together will be far from alone in selling this bill.Biden himself will stump across the country to sell the accomplishment. The President visited a bridge in Woodstock, New Hampshire, on Tuesday and plans to visit Detroit to tout electric vehicles on Wednesday -- visiting states with significant midterm races. Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as several Cabinet officials, will also hit the road, hoping to tout the local implications in the bill.The Democratic National Committee, too, has pledged to take the bill to the American people in the coming months, with an aide saying the committee plans to stretch out the messaging around the bill to create a ""constant low simmer of engagement around President Biden's achievement, instead of coming out of the gate all at once and then teetering off.""All of this represents an attempt to learn lessons from the past. Democrats believe that former President Barack Obama's administration did not successfully sell the $800 billion Recovery Act passed in 2009 and the fight over the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care overhaul signed into law in 2010, leading Democrats to take significant losses in the 2010 midterms. That cycle, Republicans used the complicated bills as an indictment of Washington, allowing Republicans to take control of the House and narrow the Democratic margin in the Senate. Obama later described the midterms as a ""shellacking.""David Axelrod, Obama's longtime adviser, said selling the infrastructure plan is dramatically different than a complicated health care law, giving him hope that Biden could see success where Obama did not.""The Affordable Care Act was a different challenge because many of its main provisions would not be enacted or felt for years,"" said Axelrod, a CNN contributor. ""In the case of the infrastructure bill, there should be visible projects underway relatively swiftly --physical evidence of progress. The task is to link those community improvements to this bill and this president in the minds of voters.""Melfi said Democrats have ""certainly learned our lesson from that fight,"" noting that one key difference is the broad popularity of infrastructure when compared to the Affordable Care Act.""Each piece of the agenda resonates with Americans across the country and across ideology. But we need to make sure we take credit for it,"" she said. ""We need to make sure folks know what is in this package and how it makes their lives better. And that's why we're getting started early.""This story has been updated.",0
81," (CNN)The White House and top Democrats are expecting a highly anticipated estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to show that their sweeping plan to expand the social safety net will fail to meet President Joe Biden's promise to not add to the federal deficit.But behind the scenes, they have been launching a preemptive strike for weeks to prepare their colleagues for that likelihood, arguing that the CBO numbers would diverge from the White House's projections that $320 billion would be raised by increased tax enforcement, a difference the administration says stems from the different methods used to calculate the revenue gained.The question now facing Democratic leaders is whether those assurances from the White House will be enough to assuage moderates, who have withheld their support for the roughly $1.9 trillion bill until information from the CBO show its costs are offset.""I am undecided on the bill,"" said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a vulnerable Democrat from a swing district in Michigan. ""I remain undecided on the bill. I want to see these scores, and I want to make sure I understand the details before I cast a vote.""Democratic leaders have very little margin for error, since they can only lose three votes to pass the bill that they are hoping gets a final vote as soon as Thursday.""We want to have the confidence that what we fiscally have said is the reality in the bill is the reality,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday.The White House has spent months explaining and preparing members for why their estimates may not line up with the CBO on increased IRS tax enforcement. But aides say that knowing the estimates and then seeing CBO's report could cause some members to react differently.Two House moderates, who have withheld their support for the $1.9 trillion bill until the CBO scores are released, told CNN on Tuesday that the shortfall on the IRS provision won't affect their view on whether to support the plan.""I think it is OK,"" said Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Blue Dog Democrat from Oregon, calling it a ""legitimate difference of opinion."" ""That would not dissuade me."" Added Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida: ""I think we for a long time have understood that there is a discrepancy between Treasury's analysis of the revenues that come from tax enforcement and what CBO's number is. We knew that based off of our negotiations during the infrastructure bill, so it doesn't come as a surprise to anyone.""Another Democrat said if any moderates defect now, it's because they want to scuttle the whole effort.""That this wouldn't line up with CBO isn't a surprise,"" one House Democrat who has worked on the revenue side of the proposal told CNN. ""If this is a deal breaker for any members, it's because they want it to be a deal breaker, not because they weren't aware of it beforehand."" Administration officials hope that their argument made to lawmakers -- that their estimates over the IRS enforcement provisions wouldn't line up with those of the due to differences in methodological approaches -- will carry weight with Democrats.""If we're telling you that we're paying for something over a 10-year period, are we giving you that service for 10 years?"" Sen. Joe Manchin, the key West Virginia moderate, said Tuesday. ""Or is it for one year, four years, three years, five years? But I think other people had that same concern."" Biden proposed the increased tax enforcement as a revenue source in negotiations over the bill that would become the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law, before dropping it after Republican objections. It then became a central component of the revenue side of the second piece of Biden's domestic agenda -- the Build Back Better Act. For months, the Treasury Department has laid out their data and research backing their conclusion the $80 billion dedicated to enforcement would net out to raise $320 billion. Embedded in those estimates has been an implicit critique of what the CBO would likely estimate. Administration officials have pointed to the indirect effects the enhanced enforcement would have, something that historically has been difficult for the CBO to score. Improvements in outdated technology infrastructure and taxpayer services are also difficult to account for, administration officials have told lawmakers.  ""When analyzing proposals that provide increased enforcement resources to the IRS, the conventional approach is to merely estimate the increased revenue collected by the IRS through additional audits and additional collection activities, but not to ascribe any changed behavior on the part of taxpayers who potentially would be subject to added enforcement scrutiny,"" Mark Mazur, then the acting assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, wrote in a September memo circulated to lawmakers. ""This convention leads to an underestimate of future revenues generated by the proposal."" Mazur's analysis, along with several derived from outside sources, have been circulated to members throughout the last several months as Biden's negotiators have made the case for the provision, officials said. How moderates react to the shortfall will remain a key question this week. ""We know what we are expecting on these different lines,"" said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat. ""We have been talking back and forth with the White House and Treasury for 10 days.""Earlier this month, five moderate Democrats signed a letter to leadership pledging they'd be ready to vote on the Build Back Better plan once they received ""fiscal information from the Congressional Budget Office"" and ""no later than the week of November 15th,"" but one member who signed onto that letter, Murphy, told CNN Monday night that she still wants to see more estimates before she votes.""The CBO estimates that we received today amount to about $70 billion, so I think there is still some more CBO estimates that we'll need to take a peak at,"" she said. While the CBO is expected to roll out estimates for each section of the bill as they have them, the CBO said on Monday that ""a complete cost estimate"" would be ready ""by the end of the day on Friday."" If that timing holds, it could push back Hoyer's hope to vote Thursday or during the day on Friday.   One senior aide to House moderates warned that a CBO score that came back showing the bill was much more than $100 billion away from meeting the budget neutral target would be a ""big problem.""""You don't want to f*** up your messaging,"" the aide said.This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",0
82,"Washington (CNN)Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows blasted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's leadership style on Thursday, suggesting that if Republicans win control of the House next year, the party should install former President Donald Trump as its next speaker. ""They're not skating to where the puck is. And so I would give them a grade of a 'D,'"" Meadows said of the House Republican leadership during an appearance on Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz's podcast. ""I believe that on this tactic and strategy -- listen, you need to make Democrats take tough votes. You need to make sure that when you've got them on the ropes that you don't throw in the white towel.""  Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina who was serving in the House before Trump picked him to be his top aide in 2020, said in a separate appearance on a podcast hosted by Trump ally Steve Bannon that he ""would love to see the gavel go from (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi to Donald Trump."" ""You talk about melting down, people would go crazy,"" he said. The speaker of the House does not need to be a member of the House, just elected by the body. The comments from Meadows underscore the growing tension in the Republican Party, with the Trump loyalist publicly criticizing McCarthy, a California Republican who is also one of Trump's top allies in Congress, less than a year before the midterm elections. McCarthy is facing heat from both his party and Democrats over recent episodes in Washington, including criticism by some Republicans who want their leader to punish more than a dozen House Republicans who voted for a bipartisan infrastructure bill that will repair roads and bridges and widen access to broadband.Democrats have blasted McCarthy over his decision not to condemn Rep. Paul Gosar after the Arizona Republican posted a photoshopped anime video on Twitter depicting him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging a sword at Biden. Former Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich, who also served for a time in the House and ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" later Thursday that Meadows' comments were ""just so crazy."" ""It looks like he's still running so much of the Republican party,"" Kasich said of Trump. ""As to whether that remains in terms of the pinnacle of his power -- yet to be seen. I hope we wake up.""Meadows faces pressure from Congress to comply with a subpoena issued by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol Hill riot. The panel is currently weighing whether to pursue a criminal contempt referral against him, something it has already done for former Trump adviser Bannon. Bannon was indicted by the Department of Justice last week and is pleading not guilty to the charges against him.",0
83," (CNN)House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday that he would reinstate Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on committees -- potentially even ""better"" ones -- if Republicans win back the House after next year's midterms.""They'll have committees,"" McCarthy said at his weekly news conference. ""They may have other committee assignments, they may have better ones. ... Taylor Greene, she was just a freshman. She has a right to serve on committees.""The California Republican also hinted that a GOP majority may kick some House Democrats off their committee seats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.""Pelosi has set new policies here. Those same members that I talked about in my speech ... voted for these new policies,"" McCarthy said, alluding to Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters of California, Adam Schiff of California, Eric Swalwell of California and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. ""This isn't about threats, but it's about holding people accountable.""I think the majority is going to have to approve any of those members on the committees on which they can serve,"" he added.Pelosi told CNN's Manu Raju earlier Thursday that she is not concerned that Republicans plan to retaliate and strip Democrats from their committee spots should the GOP win the House majority next year.Asked by CNN if she was at all concerned about retribution, Pelosi replied, ""No, we would not walk away from our responsibilities for fear of something they may do in the future.""Gosar was censured for posting a photoshopped anime video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. He eventually took the post down but retweeted a tweet that contained the video hours after being censured Wednesday.Greene was stripped of her committee assignments in February in the wake of incendiary and violent past statements that were unearthed shortly after she was sworn in.She also pushed back on the possibility that Republicans take the chamber, saying that ""their behavior on the floor says they shouldn't have a gavel anywhere near them.""At his news conference, McCarthy bristled at the suggestion that the GOP is only willing to punish members of their conference who defy Donald Trump. He disputed the idea that Republican Rep. Liz Cheney -- who was booted from GOP leadership for calling out Trump's election lies -- was punished, saying she just ""lost an election.""""We hold our members to a high standard,"" he said. ""It's interesting to me how the Democrats want rules for thee, but not for me. That's not right. And we'll change that when we're in the majority.""McCarthy said the last time he talked to Trump was earlier this morning, saying the former President called him up from the golf course.""Catching up,"" McCarthy said of their conversation. ""Wasn't even campaign [related] either. I have lots of friends. I talk to lots of people.""",0
84," (CNN)House Democrats pushed back a vote on President Joe Biden's plan to dramatically expand the social safety net after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stalled floor action with a record-breaking marathon speech that stretched into the early hours of Friday morning.McCarthy, a Republican from California, started his speech at 8:38 p.m. ET, and stopped speaking early Friday morning after eight hours and 32 minutes, making his remarks the longest House floor speech in history.McCarthy was able to hold the floor indefinitely under the procedures of the House, which say the majority leader and the minority leader get what's called a ""Magic Minute"" at the end of floor debate, meaning they can speak for as long as they want. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi used a similar tactic as minority leader in 2018, speaking for more than eight hours on the House floor in a speech about young undocumented immigrants, the previous record for a floor speech.The sweeping $1.9 trillion economic legislation was eventually passed later Friday morning and stands as a key pillar of Biden's domestic agenda. Former President Donald Trump issued a statement Friday afternoon praising McCarthy for his marathon speech. ""Great job by Kevin McCarthy last night, setting a record by going over 8 hours of speaking on the House Floor,"" Trump said, adding in a statement that Democrats had committed ""highest level of evil.""The statement contrasts with some recent messaging from Trump's allies. On Thursday, Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows criticized McCarthy, and suggested that Trump rather than McCarthy should be chosen as speaker of the House if Republicans win the majority in 2022. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, explained why Democrats delayed the vote into later Friday morning by saying McCarthy wanted to force passage of the bill ""in the dead of night,"" a politically charged description that has been used to criticize legislation in the past. ""We are going to do it in the day,"" Hoyer said. Now that the legislation has passed the House, it will face key hurdles in the Senate, with a fight looming over a controversial tax provision and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia still not on board.As a result, Democrats are working hard to keep their fragile coalition of moderates and progressives united behind the package. The legislation has already been the subject of intense disputes between warring party factions in the House, and Democrats have no margin for error in the Senate. The legislation will likely have to be altered, potentially significantly, to get every member of the Senate Democratic caucus to vote for it as key members raise major concerns with the contents of the bill.  What's in the legislationThe Build Back Better Act represents a central part of Biden's policy agenda and an attempt by congressional Democrats to go it alone without GOP support to enact a major expansion of the social safety net. The House and Senate recently passed, and Biden then signed into law, a separate $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, which marked a major legislative achievement for both parties. The Build Back Better Act is an effort by Democrats to build on that investment in traditional infrastructure by making extensive investments to ramp up social programs and address the climate crisis. Among its many provisions, the legislation would create a universal pre-K program, extend the enhanced child tax credit and expand access to health care, affordable housing and home care for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office released its final scoring for the bill early Thursday evening, estimating that the package ""would result in a net increase in the deficit totaling $367 billion over the 2022-2031 period, not counting any additional revenue that may be generated by additional funding for tax enforcement,"" according to a summary.The White House worked to make the case that the bill will be fully paid for, despite the CBO analysis showing a shortfall.Senior White House officials Brian Deese and Louisa Terrell met with moderate House Democrats after the numbers were released, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The CBO's analysis score does not include revenue from tighter IRS enforcement. The CBO estimated earlier that would raise $207 billion. The White House argues that increased IRS enforcement would actually raise more than what the CBO projects, meaning the bill would be fully paid for in their estimate.Obstacles ahead in the Senate In a warning sign for the party, Manchin, the most important swing vote who has expressed major concerns over a variety of elements of the bill, told CNN on Thursday that he has not decided whether to support voting to proceed to the Build Back Better bill, the critical first vote to take up the measure in the Senate. Any one Democratic defection would stall the effort.""No,"" Manchin said when asked if he had made a decision to vote to proceed. ""I'm still looking at everything."" The comments reflect that Manchin is still not on board with the legislation and signal the tough road ahead for Democrats.The West Virginia Democrat said that he wants to see the final numbers from the Congressional Budget Office and changes made to the bill. ""I just haven't seen the final, the final bill. So when the final bill comes out, CBO score comes out, then we'll go from there,"" he said.Manchin also reiterated his concerns about inflation. ""Everyone's concerned, they should be concerned about inflation, because it's real. Inflation is real,"" he said. ""So we got to make sure we get through this the best we can, and put no more burden on them.""This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.",0
85," (CNN)The two top leaders in the Senate have opened discussions to find a way out of a looming debt crisis, a sharp departure from the standoff a month ago that took the United States to the brink of a first-ever default. With Republicans buoyed by their chances to take back Congress in next year's midterms, they are eager to avoid another round of brinkmanship -- or potential economic catastrophe -- and are more eager to fight with their adversaries over President Joe Biden's sweeping tax-and-spending agenda and inflation woes hitting the country.  ""We don't want to interrupt our worthy adversaries while they're committing hara-kiri,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas and member of the leadership team, when asked about the different approach. In a shift from their last battle, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made a short trip over to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's second floor suite Thursday afternoon to stave off the crisis and find a deal before a December 15 deadline to raise the debt limit. It was a marked departure from the last battle when McConnell initially insisted that Republicans would not assist with the effort, prompting weeks of angry posturing before the GOP leader ultimately floated a short-term deal. Emerging from the Thursday meeting, McConnell called it a ""good discussion"" and the two agreed to ""keep talking"" about the massive year-end agenda the Senate is struggling to finish, including raising the debt ceiling and avoiding a government shutdown by December 3. Senators briefed on the matter say Republicans are open to a deal that would allow Democrats to easily raise the debt ceiling without GOP support, so long as Republicans don't drag out the process. Cornyn said the deal being discussed would ""expedite the process"" and ""avoid"" some of the time-consuming procedures to allow Democrats to vote on their own to raise the limit .  Without a deal between McConnell and Schumer or 10 GOP senators willing to break a filibuster, Democrats would have two choices to raise the debt ceiling in the 50-50 Senate.Democrats could either use a process known as budget reconciliation, which cannot be filibustered but would open them up to scores of GOP amendments in the Senate and would eat up days of precious floor time. Or they could change the filibuster rules and allow the debt ceiling to be raised by a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than 60 to break a stalling tactic -- something McConnell has been fearful his adversaries may actually do with their backs up against the wall.But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia reiterated to CNN on Wednesday that he flatly opposes going that route, ensuring Democrats would lack the support to do so. ""Absolutely,"" the West Virginia Democrat said when asked if he was still opposed to changing the filibuster rules to address the debt limit. ""Even more so."" With no clear way out of the matter, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, has floated an alternative approach that has been discussed with McConnell and other top leaders. Toomey told reporters he is frustrated that Democrats don't want to take responsibility for the debt of their expensive spending programs. Nevertheless, he wants to find a path forward that will require Democrats vote on their own, but in a less lengthy process. ""I have suggested the Republicans would yield back time, not drag things out, and I'm confident we would do that,"" Toomey said.  In the last standoff, Republicans demanded that Democrats use the budget reconciliation process, a request that Schumer and his party promptly rebuffed. That's because they contended they didn't have enough time to go through reconciliation and argued they didn't want to set a precedent by going that route for future borrowing limit increases. This time, however, Democrats have not taken as hard of a line.Yet some Democrats say they should hold firm again and force McConnell once again to give in and offer a way forward. ""Of course,"" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said when asked if he believed Republicans would supply the 10 votes needed to break a filibuster and advance to a final vote to raise the debt limit. ""Republicans have already shown us the path,"" Murphy said, referring to last month's standoff that ultimately led McConnell to propose a short-term deal. ""In the end, the Republicans weren't willing to crater the economy."" Murphy added: ""All they have to do is allow the vote to proceed. They took that offer a month ago. There's enough of them that aren't suicidal that they'll push this economy off the cliff. So that will happen again."" Sen. Brian Schatz also downplayed concerns about the looming debt limit deadline. ""There's always a lot of drama around the debt limit,"" he said. ""But we always raise the debt limit, and we'll do it again."" The Hawaii Democrat told CNN he doesn't ""want to dare"" Republicans to blink. ""But I do think that the adults will emerge because they have to."" Other Democrats aren't so confident. Senate Majority Whip Duck Durbin added that a better way is to solve the problem for good: Change the Senate's filibuster rules to allow a debt ceiling increase to advance by just a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than 60. ""We need to find a way to stop this perpetual showstopper once and for all,"" Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said Wednesday. ""And I've appealed to my colleagues regardless of how they feel about a yes or no vote to change this system. This is just unfair and it's dangerous for our economy.""Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has set a December 15 deadline to raise the debt limit, something that came after 11 GOP senators joined with Democrats voted to break a filibuster in October, paving the way for Democrats to approve a temporary extension, averting a default.  Republicans argued at the time that offering their assistance was a one-time deal to ensure Democrats wouldn't try pressure members to change filibuster rules, as well as provide them with enough time to raise the limit themselves using reconciliation.  One day after that vote, which McConnell backed, the GOP leader wrote a letter to President Joe Biden warning him that he shouldn't expect help from their party again to avert ""another avoidable crisis,"" sharply attacking Schumer for a partisan speech he delivered on the floor moments after the short-term measure was approved.""I write to inform you that I will not provide such assistance again if your all-Democrat government drifts into another avoidable crisis,"" McConnell said in the October letter to Biden.",0
86," (CNN Business)Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder and former CEO of Theranos, is taking the stand in her own criminal trial.Holmes began testimony on Friday afternoon in the San Jose courtroom during the first day of the defense's case. She is also expected to testify on Monday and Tuesday next week, the only days court is in session.Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces 11 federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each charge.Whether Holmes would testify was a big question looming over the trial. She has attended the trial each day, typically with her mother and occasionally her partner. On Friday, her partner, mother and at least one person who appeared to be her friend were in attendance. She was smiling as she took the stand and during much of her testimony.Off the bat, Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey asked her if she believed Theranos had developed technology that was capable of running any blood test. ""I did,"" Holmes testified. ""We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all the technologies in a laboratory. The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples and run that formula,"" Holmes testified, adding that by 2009 or 2010, the company had a ""breakthrough."" Downey then stepped backed to establish the background of the company's origin, including how she was a chemical engineering student at Stanford University and her first patent application.""I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money that they had saved for me to be able to go to college to work on my patent,"" she testified. ""Then I went to try to raise or borrow money.""""Were you able to?"" her attorney asked.""I was,"" she replied.The original patent was not for blood testing. Rather, she started with the idea of a pill that could be swallowed without any other actions needed, she said.Holmes went on to explain the evolution of her idea from a pill to a patch to a benchtop device. ""As I started talking to people about what could be useful for a pharmaceutical clinical trial, I learned people were interested in a benchtop or a tabletop device and we moved to trying to build that,"" she said.She testified that she then built out a prototype and set out to raise financing to develop it into a product. She testified she was introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas ""by someone who had gone to college with my dad."" ""I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long-term,"" she testified, adding that he did a ""very comprehensive diligence process.""Holmes said that process included ""giving him a lot of information about our patents."" ""He asked us to get an audit of our financials,"" she testified. ""He wanted copies of contracts and other information about the business. He wanted to speak to people that we were talking to and interacting with.""He ultimately invested and served as Theranos' chairman of the board for a number of years.Holmes' attorneys previously indicated in court documents that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. They indicated that she is ""likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed, relied on, and deferred to Mr. Balwani,"" who is nearly 20 years her senior. The filings were from 2020 and unsealed just before the trial kicked off with jury selection in late August. Balwani, according to a court filing from his attorneys, ""adamantly denies"" the claims.Her attorneys also indicated plans to have an expert testify about the psychological, emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of Balwani.A Stanford University dropout, Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 with the mission to revolutionize blood testing. Inspired by her stated fear of needles, the company promised patients the ability to test for conditions such as cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos had struck up partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway, and a who's who list of board members and investors. Then it all came crashing down. A damning investigation by The Wall Street Journal in October 2015 called into question the capabilities of the company's proprietary blood testing machine, Edison, as well as Theranos' testing methods. Theranos was subsequently sued by investors for fraud and had its US blood-testing license revoked. The firm settled ""massive fraud"" charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately dissolved in September 2018.",0
87,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)After testimony from 29 witnesses, federal prosecutors are resting their case against Elizabeth Holmes, the former CEO and founder of failed blood testing startup Theranos.  Over the course of 31 court days spread out over nearly three months, jurors heard from a broad assortment of witnesses in the San Jose federal courtroom where the highly-anticipated trial of Holmes kicked off with opening statements on September 8. The start of the trial faced numerous delays due to the ongoing pandemic and the birth of Holmes' first child this summer.To make its case, the prosecution turned to scientists, doctors, retail executives, former employees and even a former Defense Secretary. Through them, the government attempted to unravel the many layers of the alleged deception that led investors and patients to believe Theranos' false promises that it could accurately, reliably and efficiently conduct a range of tests using just a few drops of blood.Holmes, a Stanford University dropout who founded Theranos in 2003 at age 19 with the lofty mission of revolutionizing blood testing, is facing nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The government alleges she knowingly misled doctors, patients, and investors about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Now 37, Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison, as well as a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count. She has pleaded not guilty. Jurors heard from investors who lost millions of dollars after having been provided information by Holmes about Theranos' supposed blood testing capabilities. That information included, jurors learned, falsified documents purporting to be endorsements of its technology from two major pharmaceutical companies. Jurors heard from three patients; one was falsely told she was miscarrying after taking a Theranos test when, in fact, her pregnancy was viable; another was told she had HIV antibodies when previous and subsequent tests by other labs indicated she did not. The trial now turns to the defense, which has given some indications of what its case could entail during opening arguments and cross examinations of government witnesses. Holmes' team has sought to convince jurors that Holmes -- who it frequently characterizes as a young, ambitious but inexperienced entrepreneur -- acted in good faith, and lacked the intent to deceive. Instead, it has pointed at others for Theranos' downfall.Holmes' attorneys have blamed the lab's failings on lab directors and Theranos' COO and president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, with whom Holmes was romantically involved and who was roughly two decades her senior. (Balwani is set to face federal prosecutors over the same charges next year; he has pleaded not guilty.)  ""There were lots of misleading statements made during the lifespan of Theranos. The jury has now heard that evidence. But the government still has to establish intent -- and that provides a real opportunity for the defense,"" Mark MacDougall, a white-collar defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor, told CNN Business.  Many layers to the government's caseProsecutors sought to contrast the issues inside Theranos with how it was pitching itself to investors and business partners. The prosecutors also attempted to show that Holmes was at the center of it all, in an effort to address the trial's three main questions: what Holmes knew, when she knew it, and whether she intended to deceive investors, patients and doctors.Multiple high-profile witnesses testified about Holmes' charisma and, according to the former CEO of Safeway, her unusually hands-on role ""negotiating completely on her own."" Investors and retail executives testified that they were kept in the dark about the company's true capabilities. And former employees testified that they alerted Holmes directly to the lab's issues, to little effect.Surekha Gangakhedkar, a scientist who worked at Theranos for eight years, testified that she quit in 2013 over her concerns with launching blood tests to consumers through its Walgreens partnership. When she expressed this to Holmes, she testified the CEO responded by conveying ""that when she has a promise to deliver to the customer, she doesn't have much of a choice but to go ahead with the launch.""Similarly, Adam Rosendorff, the former lab director who was questioned for six days of the trial, testified that while he technically reported to Balwani, Holmes sat above Balwani. Rosendorff said he made his own concerns known to Holmes and ultimately determined ""the company believed more about PR and fundraising than about patient care."" After Rosendorff departed, Theranos had two co-lab directors who overlapped yet were unaware of each others' existence. One rarely ever set foot in the lab and only met Holmes once; the other never visited the lab. Investors and business partners had little visibility into these issues at the time. Former executives for Walgreens and Safeway, testified that they were kept in the dark that the company relied on third-party devices, rather than its own, to analyze patient blood. Witnesses like former Walgreens executive Wade Miquelon testified being shown pharmaceutical company endorsements which had been faked.Miquelon and some investors also said they were impressed by another misleading claim: that Theranos' technology was being tested in Afghanistan on military helicopters. ""What better application for a technology like this than in a military setting under harsh conditions like one would expect in a place like Afghanistan or Iraq,"" investor Brian Grossman, whose firm Partner Fund Management poured $96 million into Theranos, testified this week.Theranos' association with retired four-star general and former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who once served on Theranos' board, made it plausible that the startup could have had its technology deployed to help solders in war zones and on military aircrafts. But Mattis, arguably the biggest name to take the stand, testified it was not, as did a former Theranos employee who was involved with its conversations with the military.These misrepresentations were fed directly from Holmes to journalist Roger Parloff, who was the government's final witness before it rested its case. Parloff wrote the 2014 Fortune Magazine cover story, which was one of the glowing articles that circulted Theranos' claims and factored into why investors were wowed.Six investors, whose investments are each part of the wire fraud charges Holmes is facing, took the stand, including some who spoke about investments made by some of the world's wealthiest families.Among them were a money manager for the billionaire family of former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and a former lawyer who first heard about Theranos from a longtime client — former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger — and then solicited other rich families to invest, including the DeVos family, the Waltons of the Walmart fortune, and the heir to an Italian auto empire. From the outset of the trial, legal experts have suggested jurors may be less sympathetic to investors than patients, who are the other category of alleged victims in the government's case.The government introduced two patients, and a doctor in the final week of its case. Earlier this month, the prosecution botched an attempt to bring in another patient because it failed to list the specific test the patient took on a document previously provided to the defense. That error resulted in the government removing one count of wire fraud.The prosecution had listed roughly 180 possible witnesses it may call. Among those it didn't call: Kissinger, who once sat on the board; media mogul Rupert Murdoch who reportedly invested $125 million; high-powered attorney David Boies who was an investor, board member and legal defense for Holmes and Theranos, and employee-turned-whistleblower Tyler Shultz, the grandson of the late George Shultz, another former Secretary of State and board member. Jurors heard her voice, read her texts and saw clips of her TV interviewsIn the company's heyday, Holmes was the subject of much media attention as it soared to its once-$9 billion valuation. In its downfall, that spotlight hasn't dimmed -- there have been documentaries, a forthcoming limited series, a planned feature film and at least two podcasts devoted to covering the trial. That attention was a big challenge to selecting a pool of jurors largely unfamiliar with her.But since the beginning of the trial, jurors -- who knew little, if anything about the baritone-voiced entrepreneur with a penchant for black turtlenecks -- have only gotten glimpses into how she spoke, and presented herself.They heard audio from a 2013 investor call where Holmes made claims about Theranos' testing capabilities and its work with the military. They also saw television clips from interviews she gave after the 2015 Wall Street Journal investigation that first poked holes in its technology and testing methods. ""I'm the founder and CEO of the company — anything that happens in this company is my responsibility,"" she said, in a April 2016 Today Show clip.Perhaps the most intimate look jurors have gotten into Holmes' state of mind at the time of the alleged fraud has come through text messages between her and Balwani. The texts, some of which have been introduced through various witnesses, ranged from personal to professional and reveal the two were in constant communication. Among them, they discussed the state of Theranos' clinical lab in November, 2014 as the company was securing investments (""Normandy lab is a f***ing disaster zone,"" Balwani wrote) and how they felt when regulators were doing a laboratory audit in September, 2015 (""Praying literally non stop,"" Holmes wrote. ""Going bad so far. Pray,"" Balwani wrote). There were also more intimate ""love you"" texts to some confusing ones that mentioned ""the death and sex thing,"" which went unexplained to jurors. ""There's an aspect of many criminal cases where the jury is asked to get inside the heads of the defendant and other important individuals in the case and that can be uncomfortable for a variety of reasons,"" said Jessica Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Cardozo Law School professor. Roth noted that, given the particulars of the Holmes case, ""it is warranted, at least to a certain extent, to get inside that relationship and to understand the nature of the power dynamics.""Will Holmes take the stand? Whether jurors will get to hear from Holmes, who is listed as a possible witness, remains an open question. Legal experts such as Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg say that determining whether to take the stand is ""a very complicated calculation."" Doing so would mean subjecting Holmes to a cross-examination that would undoubtedly be ""really, really rigorous."" He noted that anything she testifies about could potentially be impeached by things she has said and written over the years. Another looming question: whether Holmes will claim she was the victim of intimate partner abuse at the hands of Balwani. The allegation, which Balwani's attorneys have denied, was introduced in pre-trial filings. So far, her attorneys have only vaguely hinted at the idea in opening arguments. Still, among the possible witnesses for Holmes is clinical psychologist, Dr. Mindy Mechanic, whose work focuses on the psychosocial consequences of violence, trauma and victimization.The defense is likely to continue playing up Holmes' youthful age and lack of experience at the time of the alleged fraud. Through cross examinations, the defense has drilled into the expertise of witnesses and their teams in contrast to Holmes. Holmes, her attorneys have argued, wasn't qualified to run a laboratory. The defense also sought to sow doubt in the due diligence process of investors and underscore that startups are known to be risky investments. ""Elizabeth was only in her twenties, had no prior business experience and was surrounded by much older mentors and advisers,"" said MacDougall, the white-collar defense lawyer. ""The defense now has the chance to put the evidence in context.""George Demos, a former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and an adjunct law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, said the defense ""may call witnesses to testify about Theranos' successes to show that Holmes was in fact on the road to achieving her goals.""Holmes, who has been present each day inside the courtroom, is dutifully accompanied by her mother, Noel, who oftentimes walks hand-in-hand with her daughter to the door through which she enters the courtroom and gives her a hug. (Holmes' father is listed as a possible defense witness.)Anne Kopf-Sill, Phd., a retired biotechnology executive who has been attending the trial most days and has been following the story of Theranos for years, said she's been struck by the persona Holmes gives off in the courtroom: ""She's just sitting there looking sweeter than an angel.""

88," (CNN Business)Every time you pick up your smartphone, you're summoning algorithms. They're used for everything from unlocking your phone with your face to deciding what videos you see on TikTok to updating your Google Maps route to avoid a freeway accident on your way to work.An algorithm is a set of rules or steps followed, often by a computer, to produce an outcome.  And algorithms aren't just on our phones: they're used in all kinds of processes, on and offline, from helping value your home to teaching your robot vacuum to steer clear of your dog's poop. Over the years they've increasingly been entrusted with life-altering decisions, such as helping decide who to arrest, who should be released from jail before a court date, and who's approved for a home loan.In recent weeks, there has been renewed scrutiny of algorithms, including how tech companies should shift the ways they use them. This stems both from concerns raised in hearings featuring Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen and from bipartisan legislation introduced in the House (a companion bill had previously been reintroduced in the Senate). The legislation would force large tech companies to allow users to access a version of their platforms where what they see isn't shaped by algorithms. These developments highlight mounting awareness about the central role algorithms play in our society.""At this point, they are responsible for making decisions about pretty much every aspect of our lives,"" said Chris Gilliard, a visiting research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.Yet the ways in which algorithms work, and the conclusions they reach, can be mysterious, particularly as the use of artificial intelligence techniques make them ever more complex. Their outcomes aren't always understood, or accurate — and the consequences can be disastrous. And the impact of potential new legislation to limit the influence of algorithms on our lives remains unclear.Algorithms, explainedAt its most basic, an algorithm is a series of instructions. As Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist on the ethical AI team at AI model builder Hugging Face, pointed out, it can be hard coded, with fixed directions for a computer to follow, such as to put a list of names in alphabetical order. Simple algorithms have been used for computer-based decision making for decades.Today, algorithms help ease otherwise-complicated processes all the time, whether we know it or not. When you direct a clothing website to filter pajamas to see the most popular or least expensive options, you're using an algorithm essentially to say, ""Hey, Old Navy, go through the steps to show me the cheapest jammies.""All kinds of things can be algorithms, and they're not confined to computers: A recipe, for instance, is a sort of algorithm, as is the weekday morning routine you sleepily shuffle through before leaving the house.""We run on our own personal algorithms every day,"" said Jevan Hutson, a data privacy and security lawyer at Seattle-based Hintze Law who has studied AI and surveillance.But while we can interrogate our own decisions, those made by machines have become increasingly enigmatic. That's because of the rise of a form of AI known as deep learning, which is modeled after the way neurons work in the brain and gained prominence about a decade ago.A deep-learning algorithm might task a computer with looking at thousands of videos of cats, for instance, to learn to identify what a cat looks like. (It was a big deal when Google figured out how to do this reliably in 2012.) The result of this process of binging on data and improving over time would be, in essence, a computer-generated procedure for how the computer will identify whether there's a cat in any new pictures it sees. This is often known as a model (though it is also at times referred to as an algorithm itself).These models can be incredibly complex. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter use them to help personalize users' feeds based on each person's interests and prior activity. The models can also be based on mounds of data collected over many years that no human could possibly sort through. Zillow, for instance, has been using its trademarked, machine-learning assisted ""Zestimate"" to estimate the value of homes since 2006, taking into consideration tax and property records, homeowner-submitted details such as the addition of a bathroom, and pictures a house.The risks of relying on algorithmsAs Zillow's case shows, however, offloading decision-making to algorithmic systems can also go awry in excruciating ways, and it's not always clear why.Zillow recently decided to shutter its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, showing how hard it is to use AI to value real estate. In February, the company had said its ""Zestimate"" would represent an initial cash offer from the company to purchase the property through its house flipping business; in November, the company took a $304 million inventory writedown, which it blamed on having recently purchased homes for prices that are higher than it thinks it can sell them.Elsewhere online, Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has come under scrutiny for tweaking its algorithms in a way that helped incentivize more negative content on the world's largest social network.There have been life-changing consequences of algorithms, too, particularly in the hands of police. We know, for instance, that several Black men, at least, have been wrongfully arrested due to the use of facial-recognition systems.There's often little more than a basic explanation from tech companies on how their algorithmic systems work and what they're used for. Beyond that, experts in technology and tech law told CNN Business that even those who build these systems don't always know why they reach their conclusions — which is a reason why they're often referred to as ""black boxes.""""Computer scientists, data scientists, at this current stage they seem like wizards to a lot of people because we don't understand what it is they do,"" Gilliard said. ""And we think they always do, and that's not always the case.""Popping filter bubblesThe United States doesn't have federal rules for how companies can or can't use algorithms in general, or those that harness AI in particular. (Some states and cities have passed their own rules, which tend to address facial-recognition software or biometrics more generally.) But Congress is currently considering legislation dubbed the Filter Bubble Transparency Act, which, if passed, would force large Internet companies such as Google, Meta, TikTok and others to ""give users the option to engage with a platform without being manipulated by algorithms driven by user-specific data"".In a recent CNN Opinion piece, Republican Sen. John Thune described the legislation he cosponsored as ""a bill that would essentially create a light switch for big tech's secret algorithms — artificial intelligence (AI) that's designed to shape and manipulate users' experiences — and give consumers the choice to flip it on or off."" Facebook, for example, does already have this, though users are effectively discouraged from flipping the so-called switch permanently. A fairly well-hidden ""Most Recent"" button will show you posts in a reverse chronological order, but your Facebook News Feed will go back to its original, heavily moderated state once you leave the website or shut the app. Meta stopped offering such an option on Instagram, which it also owns, in 2016.Hutson noted that while the Filter Bubble Transparency Act clearly focuses on large social platforms, it will inevitably affect others such as Spotify and Netflix that depend deeply on algorithmically-driven curation. If it passes, he said, it will ""fundamentally change"" the business model of companies that are built entirely around algorithmic curation — a feature he suspects many users appreciate in certain contexts.""This is going to impact organizations far beyond those that are in the spotlight,"" he said. AI experts argue the need for more transparency is crucial from companies making and using algorithms. Luccioni believes laws for algorithmic transparency are necessary before specific usages and applications of AI can be regulated.""I see things changing, definitely, but there is a really frustrating lag between what AI is capable of and what it's legislated for,"" Luccioni said.",0
89,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)Journalist Roger Parloff, who wrote the first major cover story on Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes and later issued a retraction, was called to testify in her criminal trial Thursday.The government has alleged Holmes used the media, and Parloff's Fortune Magazine story titled ""This CEO is Out for Blood"" in particular, to perpetuate a scheme to defraud investors.Parloff's testimony comes as the government has said it is close to resting its case against Holmes. She faces a dozen counts of federal fraud and conspiracy charges, and up to 20 years in prison over allegations that she knowingly misled doctors, patients and investors in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty.Parloff is set to return to the stand Friday for continued cross-examination. Thus far the defense has focused on Parloff's note taking and reporting process.Holmes was for a time upheld in the media as a rare female founder who'd raised significant sums of capital and driven her startup to an eye-popping $9 billion valuation. Parloff's story was the first of many laudatory cover stories of Holmes and has been shown repeatedly in the San Jose courtroom. Through Parloff's testimony, the government pieced together various layers of the alleged fraud that it has spent more than 10 weeks establishing before jurors through witness testimonies. Parloff testified he has interview notes, as well as 10 hours of audio recordings from interviews associated with his 2014 Fortune story, clips of which have been played for the jury. The recordings contrast how Holmes represented the company's capabilities with what jurors have heard from other witness testimonies. In one recording, Holmes explains that the company can do tests for 1,000 ""CPT"" or medical codes, despite its website stating 200 tests. Jurors have previously heard Theranos could only perform around a dozen tests using its proprietary technology, one of the numerous points prosecutor John Bostic sought to highlight through questioning Parloff about what Holmes told him in his interviews.Parloff said Holmes did not tell him about Theranos' reliance on third-party devices. When Parloff asked Holmes about use of venous draws instead of its finger stick method, Holmes is heard ticking off a list of reasons why it may conduct such a sample, but does not disclose, as Bostic elicited, it is because of the limitations of Theranos' devices.Parloff testified that Holmes told him that its tech had been used in Afghanistan, but that ""she did not want me to publish that."" While Parloff interviewed James Mattis, the former US Secretary of Defense and onetime Theranos board member, he testified Holmes told him the retired four-star general couldn't discuss deployment and not to ask him about it.During his reporting, Holmes sent Parloff the reports, affixed with Pfizer and Schering-Plough logos, purporting to validate its blood tests, which jurors have learned were not legitimate. Parloff testified that after the article's publication, Holmes ""praised it effusively,"" and said he believed she linked to it on Theranos' website. The article, which contained false and misleading statements, circulated to stakeholders and how it played a role in validating the company to outsiders.""This morning I had one of the most interesting meetings I can recall with the women [sic] profiled in the attached Fortune magazine article,"" read one email shown to jurors from the CEO of RDV Corp, the family office of the billionaire family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The email was sent to members of the DeVos family before they invested $100 million into Theranos.Investor Chris Lucas, whose firm Black Diamond Ventures invested more than $7 million across two funding rounds in 2006 and 2013, testified earlier this month that the piece made him ""proud of the situation. Proud that we are involved. Proud of Elizabeth."" ""Great article, great pictures, the whole thing,"" testified Lucas.In a column more than a year later titled ""How Theranos Misled Me,"" Parloff acknowledged that the article ""helped raise to prominence"" Holmes. (There is now an author's note at the top of his original article that links to the column and reads, ""On December 17, 2015, I published a protracted correction to this article here."")""As much as I'd like to say that Holmes lied to me, I don't think she did. I do believe I was misled — intentionally — but I was also culpable, in that I failed to probe certain exasperatingly opaque answers that I repeatedly received,"" wrote Parloff, who was formerly an attorney.The government said in a court filing that it will not seek to admit the follow-up column but ""reserves the right to introduce that article for a non-hearsay purpose should the defense open the door by questioning Parloff about statements he made in that article.""For weeks, attorneys have been wrangling over what Parloff can testify to, and what information he can be compelled to provide. While Parloff has turned over audio recordings and notes from his interviews with Holmes and former Theranos COO Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani as part of a grand jury subpoena order, he successfully fought a trial subpoena order by Holmes' defense team for notes and recordings from interviews he conducted with others for his story. (Balwani faces the same charges as Holmes; his criminal trial is slated to begin next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.)Holmes' attorneys argued those notes may serve to refute the claims that Holmes misled Parloff, and through him, investors. Judge Nathanael Cousins, who presided in a hearing on the matter, called the quest for Parloff's additional notes ""a fishing expedition as to whether there might be material out there that could be helpful to the defense.""Parloff's remorse over the story has been well-documented. ""Roger was first [to the story] and felt a tremendous amount of guilt,"" said Alex Gibney in 2019. Gibney is the prolific documentary filmmaker whose HBO film, ""The Inventor,"" chronicled the rise and fall of Theranos. Gibney, who has said his work started with interviewing journalists who felt duped, has called Parloff the ""beating heart"" of his film. (CNN and HBO share a parent company.)In addition to Parloff's article, a 2013 piece by a Wall Street Journal opinion writer, who has since passed away, has been frequently brought up in the courtroom. The government has alleged that, prior to its publication, Holmes approved the piece, which offered a glowing look at Holmes and Theranos, but also contained misleading claims about the company's capabilities at the time. The article corresponded with a broader unveiling of the startup after years of operating in stealth and was leveraged by Holmes as validation of the company.In a statement to CNN Business in September, Journal spokesperson Steve Severinghaus said, ""editors make publishing decisions based on their independent judgment.""The statement continued, ""Our writer asked Elizabeth Holmes to confirm complicated facts on a technical subject, not to approve publication. Our writer visited Theranos, spoke with numerous sources in and outside the company about its technology, and had his blood tested on a Theranos machine that appeared to offer credible results. If that was all a deception, then the responsibility lies with Ms. Holmes and Theranos.""",0
90,"New York (CNN Business)A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general have launched an investigation into Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on children and teens.  The announcement follows extensive reporting on a trove of internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Some of those documents show that the company's own researchers have found that Instagram can damage young users' mental health and body image, and can exacerbate dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders.  The attorneys general say they will look into whether, by continuing to provide and promote Instagram despite knowing of the potential harms, Meta violated consumer protection laws and ""put the public at risk."" The states involved include California, Florida, Kentucky and Vermont. ""Facebook, now Meta, has failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health -- exploiting children in the interest of profit,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigation, said in a statement. She added that the coalition hopes to ""get to the bottom of this company's engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good."" Meta (FB) spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement that the allegations made by the attorneys general are false and said they ""demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts."" He also noted that the company plans to launch features to help teens regulate their use of Instagram, such as a ""Take a Break"" reminder, which was announced in October amid intense scrutiny.  ""While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,"" the statement reads. ""We continue to develop parental supervision controls and are exploring ways to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for teens by default."" The investigation is the latest escalation of regulatory pressure on Meta related to findings from the leaked internal documents, which have come to be known as the Facebook Papers. Earlier this week, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that it misled the public about its algorithm and the harms its apps can cause to users, causing losses for shareholders when those things were revealed. (Meta says the suit is without merit.) Senator Richard Blumenthal has also asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about the effects of Instagram on children. The Wall Street Journal first reported in September on what the company's own documents and research show about the potential harms to young people from its apps, and said Facebook knew Instagram was ""toxic"" for teen girls. In one internal report from 2019 on the mental health effects of Instagram cited by the Journal and reviewed by CNN Business, company researchers said ""we make body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls."" Meta has also pushed back on the Journal's reporting, and said its apps do more good than harm.  Following the Journal's report, a Senate subcommittee called a hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone Davis, where lawmakers grilled her on Instagram's effects on kids. Davis said the company was ""looking for ways to release more research"" that she suggested might paint a different picture about the platform. Haugen has also testified to lawmakers that she believes Meta's platforms ""harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.""  The company announced it was pausing plans to develop a version of Instagram designed for kids in late September, amid the fallout from the Journal report.  ""While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we've decided to pause this project,"" Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote in a blog post at the time. ""This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.""

91," (CNN Business)Activision Blizzard's longtime CEO Bobby Kotick is facing mounting pressure from employees to step down amid the company's ongoing sexual harassment scandal.More than 800 Activision Blizzard workers so far have signed a petition calling for Kotick's resignation. The petition, released on Thursday by a group of employees, says they ""no longer have confidence"" in Kotick's leadership. ""We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders,"" the petition added.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) — which owns hugely popular titles such as ""Call of Duty,"" ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Candy Crush"" — has been roiled by a sexual harassment and discrimination scandal for months and is currently under scrutiny from multiple government agencies.An Activision Blizzard spokesperson said in response to the petition that the company was ""fully committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and rewarding environment"" for its 9,500 employees worldwide. ""We support employees' rights to express their opinions and concerns in a safe and respectful manner, without fear of retaliation,"" the spokesperson added. The petition comes two days after more than 100 employees organized a walkout demanding Kotick step down. That walkout, the company's second in less than six months, came in response to a Wall Street Journal investigation indicating the CEO was aware of the company's harassment and discrimination issues for several years. The report cited internal company documents and people familiar with the matter. Kotick said in a statement to employees that the Journal story ""paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership."" He added that ""anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn't really appreciate how important this is to me.""While the report prompted renewed tension with some employees, Activision Blizzard's board of directors has so far stuck by Kotick. ""The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick's leadership, commitment and ability"" to address the company's longstanding and ongoing issues with harassment and discrimination, it said in a statement Tuesday.Kotick, who has been Activision CEO since 1991, including at the time of the 2008 merger with Blizzard, has been in damage control mode for most of this year.Last month, he announced an intention to slash his controversial $155 million pay package — one of the largest in corporate America — to the ""lowest amount California law will allow"" until the gaming company fixes its issues with gender discrimination and harassment. If the board approves, Kotick will be paid $62,500, he said.",0
92,"Seoul (CNN Business)Tim Sweeney is on a mission. The Epic Games CEO has been mounting a relentless attack on Apple, after the tech giant kicked his company's hugely popular video game Fortnite off the App Store. Apple said at the time that Epic flouted rules on digital payments by establishing its own system.Epic sued Apple in response, kicking off a highly public trial. Apple has argued that its rigid payments system exists to protect the security and privacy of its developers and customers, and that it's only a small part of the video game market — and therefore has no monopoly. Sweeney sees things differently. Companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL), he argues, wield enormous power over the app market. Their control prevents consumers and companies from choosing how they do business.The case is still working its way through US courts, but in September a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside its App Store. Still, the judge stopped short of calling Apple a monopoly, and the company has barred Fortnite from its devices until the legal battle finishes, which could delay the game's return to iPhones by several years.CNN Business caught up with Sweeney in Seoul, where he was attending the Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness — an event hosted by South Korean lawmaker Jo Seounglae. The country recently enacted a law that allows app developers to use alternative payment systems. We asked Sweeney questions about that law, as well as his ongoing fight with Apple, Fortnite's failed foray into China and his thoughts on the ""metaverse,"" the virtual world Facebook (FB) sees as its future. Our Q&A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.South Korea recently passed a bill banning mandatory in-app purchases and ordering tech companies to allow alternative payments. What did you think?I was very happy to see that Korea was taking the leadership role, initially. Korea is one of the leading technology powerhouses in the world, with Samsung (SSNLF) and all the great game developers around Korea. It's great to see Korea really defending developers, including all the Korean developers against these bad practices [by] Apple and Google. How much business and revenue has Epic Games lost as a result of getting kicked off Apple's ecosystem?Fortnite had made hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Fortnite being off of iOS, it's losing that much now. But fortunately, Fortnite is also successful on personal computers and game consoles. So the business continues to be strong, despite being off of iOS. But it just shows how much power Apple wields and is able to completely eliminate a game's existence on iOS. No platform company should have that power, right? Consumers should be free to install software. And developers should be free to create software, and the platform company should never stand in between them.Do you have any regrets about how the legal battles with Apple and Google have played out?We always knew it would be a slow and complex case. Both Apple and Epic realized from the beginning that whatever happened within the District Court ... the decision would be appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court in the United States, and, if possible, to the United States Supreme Court, to ultimately make the decision. And so, it was inevitable that this would take many years.Do you have anything to say to the people who have influence over this issue in the United States? Ultimately, this is a battle for consumer rights. Though the disputes are mostly between companies and governments, it's about the right of a smartphone owner to be able to install software from sources of their choosing, and to do business directly with developers without the platform company adding taxes and fees to every transaction. ... It's about the basic freedom of everybody to do business together directly if they choose. I think it's the most important fight for digital rights in the industry right now. Because more and more of our lives are moving online and becoming digital — all of our digital interactions are increasingly controlled by Google and Apple. If we allow the world's two most powerful corporations to control our online lives, it'll become a force that's more powerful than the government itself.Epic spent a long time working on Fortnite's launch in China, but it didn't happen. Was that time and effort worth it?I'm glad we tried. There's always been a lot of uncertainty about the future of US-China relations, and unfortunately, they've been strained for the past few years. And we just didn't see a realistic likelihood of being able to receive approval to launch in China. So we gave up trying, but I think it was a good effort.The team did a wonderful job, and I wish there had been a way, but I think there's just going to be a long period in which there's a separation between consumer services inside China and globally.What is the ""metaverse"" to you?It is real time 3D entertainment experiences that are social. It's you and your friends together in a 3D world, having fun in lots of different ways. You can be playing games like Fortnite Battle Royale, you can be going to concerts, you can be dancing, or you can just be standing around and chatting. It's all the sorts of social interactions we can have in real time 3D together with our group of friends.What kind of future do you envision in the metaverse? Is it really going to be a game changer, like the internet was when it was introduced?I think it will take a decade or more to really get to the end point, but I think that is happening. And it will be a better online experience than we're having today. It will succeed because it's better. The metaverse doesn't require fancy new hardware. It doesn't require all that reality hardware or [virtual reality] or things that haven't been invented yet. You can get online and start experiencing this right now.The next step of this metaverse evolution is to open up broader experiences to bring in the next billion users.What are some of the biggest hurdles to making it happen?The metaverse isn't going to be created by one company. It will be created by millions of developers each building out their part of it.Another challenge is building the economy. In order to have millions of developers building for the metaverse, you need to have a business where they can make as much or more money from that effort, developing software to support their businesses.We need to win the fight against platform monopolies, because Apple and Google currently have rules in place to prevent the metaverse from existing on the Google Play Store and on iOS. They have rules that prevent web browsers from existing — you're only allowed to use their web browser.They don't allow commerce to be done directly with users. They don't allow code to be run on your local device if it hasn't been reviewed by Apple and Google. The metaverse needs to support all of these things, so we really need to win this battle to open up platforms before the metaverse can truly exist.-- Rishi Iyengar and Jill Disis contributed to this report.",0
93,"New York (CNN Business)The director of the United Nations' World Food Programme laid out a plan to spend $6.6 billion to combat world hunger — a direct response to a back-and-forth with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who claimed he would sell Tesla stock to fund a plan if the WFP could describe ""exactly how"" it would work. David Beasley, the UN food program director and former Republican governor of South Carolina, tweeted a link on Monday to a 1,000-word ""executive summary."" It maps out how the UN would deploy $6.6 billion worth of meals and vouchers to feed more than 40 million people across 43 countries that are ""on the brink of famine"" — thereby averting what the WFP is calling a looming ""catastrophe.""In the document Beasley posted, the WFP proposes dedicating $3.5 billion to buy and deliver food directly, $2 billion ""for cash and food vouchers (including transaction fees) in places where markets can function,"" and spending another $700 million to manage new food programs that are ""adapted to the in-country"" conditions and ensure ""the assistance reaches the most vulnerable.""Another $400 million would be used for ""operations management, administration and accountability"" and supply chain coordination. ""The world is on fire,"" Beasley wrote. ""I've been warning about the perfect storm brewing due to Covid, conflict, climate shocks & now, rising supply chain costs. IT IS HERE."" ""This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable,"" Beasley wrote in a separate tweet, tagging Musk, who is the world's wealthiest person with a net worth of approximately $288 billion. ""You asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you - and anyone else - who is serious about saving lives.""As of Wednesday afternoon, Musk had not responded.The back-and-forth between Musk and Beasley kicked off with a CNN interview last month in which Beasley asked billionaires to ""step up now, on a one-time basis"" to help combat world hunger, specifically citing the world's two richest men: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.Beasley said giving $6 billion, or 2% of Musk's net worth, could help solve world hunger. Musk responded on Twitter, writing, ""If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it."" ""But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent,"" Musk added.Beasley previously replied to Musk's tweets, assuring him that systems are in place for transparency and open source accounting.""For him to even enter into this conversation is a game-changer because simply put, we can answer his questions, we can put forth a plan that's clear,"" Beasley told CNN in a follow-up interview earlier this month. ""Any and everything he asks, we would be glad to answer. I look forward to having this discussion with him because lives are at stake.""Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the world's hunger crisis was already exacerbated by climate change and conflict. The pandemic compounded the existing issues though, leaving ""42 million people that are literally knocking on famine's door,"" Beasley said. ""This is a worst-case scenario."" It's not clear if Musk or Bezos have seen the plan and will ultimately decide to lend their support. Spokespeople for Musk's companies did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for Bezos, Angela Landers, declined to comment on the WFP's proposal but pointed to other philanthropic donations Bezos has made to combating hunger.Musk has previously made bold promises on Twitter, committing resources to charitable endeavors. In 2018, for example, he pledged to ""fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels."" Musk ended up donating about half a million dollars for installing water filters in the town's schools, according to an August article from a local news outlet. Musk has made more sizable donations to certain projects. This year, he promised to donate $30 million to Brownsville, Texas, the city nearest to a massive rocket hub run by his company SpaceX, and local schools. He also set up the Musk Foundation, which says it gives to efforts related to renewable energy expansion, human space exploration and safe uses of artificial intelligence. He's also signed The Giving Pledge, a promise to donate at least half of his wealth to charitable efforts during his lifetime, something Bezos has not done.",0
94," (CNN Business)Entering the new Amazon Web Services Skills Center is a bit like walking into a high-tech museum. Among its exhibits are a rotating, globe-shaped screen that displays images of planets or weather patterns, an interactive ""smart home"" model and a table full of small robot vehicles trained by machine learning.  The space is designed to introduce visitors to practical applications of cloud computing — an increasingly popular set-up in which companies' technical operations are run in data centers managed by Amazon or other cloud companies, rather than in costly on-site servers. AWS hopes the center will interest some visitors in the possibility of a career in the industry. The Skills Center, which is located on Amazon's corporate headquarters campus in Seattle, Washington, and opens to the public November 22, is the first of its kind for the company. It's part of a larger commitment to train 29 million people globally in cloud computing by 2025 that AWS made last year.  It's also one of the first major announcements that new AWS chief executive Adam Selipsky has made since taking over from Andy Jassy, who was elevated to Amazon CEO when Jeff Bezos left the post in July. The Skills Center is ""going to be a free, accessible space for anybody who wants to learn more about cloud computing, what it is, what the applications are ... everything that illustrates the true breadth of the cloud, and importantly, there's going to be a lot of skills training here,"" Selipsky told CNN Business in an exclusive interview ahead of the center's opening.""There's a dramatic need for digital skills overall, and for cloud skills in particular, and this is part of a very broad effort,"" he said. ""We're going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to bring that training to tens of millions of people worldwide.""  Although the company declined to disclose an exact amount, it's a big investment into free training for people who will mostly become employees of other companies. But it's crucial to AWS's business because of a significant talent gap that threatens to hamper potential customers' adoption of cloud technology.""I have that conversation with executives of companies all the time,"" said Maureen Lonergan, vice president of AWS Training and Certification. ""So we work not only on training new people to cloud but working with customers to transform their traditional IT staff to cloud-fluent individuals.""  The talent gap comes as demand for cloud computing has surged during the pandemic. But AWS, long the cloud industry leader, is facing steep competition from rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOGLGOOGLE) Cloud, something Selipsky will have to address as the unit's new leader.  Though Amazon (AMZN) is best known for e-commerce, its cloud unit has long been its biggest money maker. In the most recent quarter, AWS contributed nearly 56% of the company's overall net income, and it now has a revenue run rate of around $64 billion. ""The cloud is actually one of the most transformative technological changes of our generation,"" said Selipsky, who started at AWS in the division's early days and spent 11 years with the company before leaving to run data visualization firm Tableau for five years. ""I know that sounds like a big statement but if you think about, when is the last time you went to rent a DVD or incurred late fees? Netflix changed all of that by streaming and that happens on AWS ... No matter what sector you look at, no matter what application you look at, it's now more and more not running in data centers that companies build and operate and put capital into and stress out about, it operates through a place like AWS."" At the Skills Center, Amazon plans to invite anyone from the Seattle community — students, unemployed workers or others looking for a career change — to get a better sense of what cloud computing is and why it matters; for example, it makes real-time, mobile gaming over the internet possible. From there, visitors interested in career opportunities in the field will have access to free tech and cloud basics courses at the center, and may be directed to AWS's other training resources. The company hopes tens of thousands of people will visit the center to explore or take classes each year. As part of Thursday's announcement, the company also said it will add around 60 free, digital cloud computing training and certification courses to Amazon.com. It is also expanding access to its Re/Start program, a free 12-week training course that prepares people for an entry level job in cloud computing, from 25 cities in 12 countries in 2020 to more than 95 cities in 38 countries by the end of 2021. The company expects to open more Skills Centers around the world starting next year, according to Lonergan.The company also hopes to reach people who have had a harder time accessing roles in tech. The Skills Center and the training programs are free and target people who don't have prior experience in tech. The company also plans to partner with local workforce development agencies in Seattle to bring people from diverse backgrounds into the facility. That effort could help increase diversity in the cloud computing field, which, like the larger tech world, still skews white and male. Amazon's own global corporate staff was comprised of nearly 69% men and 47% white employees in 2020, according to its most recent workforce data report.  ""Our customers are so incredibly diverse and who they are, and their use cases and their industries, and the companies in which they operate are so diverse, it's hard to imagine that we could really deliver what they need from us if we are not equally diverse,"" Selipsky said.

95," (CNN Business)Apple plans to give customers the ability to repair their own devices amid growing pressure from regulators and consumers around the world for manufacturers to ease restrictions on fixing products.The company on Wednesday announced a new program that will make spare parts for Apple products available to purchase starting early next year. The program, known as Self Service Repair, will let users fix broken devices using repair manuals that Apple will post on its website. Apple (AAPL) plans to start with some components that tend to require replacement such as displays, batteries and camera modules. The company says it will have more than 200 parts and tools available at launch and plans for more to be added later next year. The repair program will initially be available only for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 users, but will later expand to Mac computers that use Apple's new in-house M1 chip. The company will only reveal the prices of its spare parts when the program formally launches next year, but Apple said it will charge individual users the same prices it currently charges independent repair providers. Apple's move comes as electronics manufacturers — as well as the makers of everything from tractors to hospital equipment — face increasing pressure to ease restrictions on independent device repair shops or DIY repairs, a push known as the ""right to repair"" movement. Companies have been criticized for using tactics that make it harder for independent repair businesses to access devices, such as using non-removable memory or batteries, or sealing devices with special glue. Critics argue these tactics can lead to more costs for consumers, hurt independent repair shops and be bad for the environment. President Joe Biden passed an executive order in July that directed the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules requiring companies to allow DIY repairs. Days later, the FTC unanimously voted to condemn existing repair restrictions by manufacturers, with the agency's chair, Lina Khan, vowing to ""root out"" illegal repair restrictions that may flout US antitrust and consumer protection laws.Regulators in the United Kingdom and Europe have also either already passed or are considering legislation to force device manufacturers to provide their customers with spare parts.It's not just regulators. One of the noteworthy advocates for the ""right to repair"" movement has been Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who said earlier this year that he was ""totally supportive"" of the cause. ""We wouldn't have had an Apple had I not grown up in a very open technology world,"" he said in a video on the celebrity shout-out website Cameo.iFixit, a popular online repair website for consumer electronics that has criticized Apple and other companies for not allowing self repairs, welcomed Wednesday's announcement. ""We're thrilled to see Apple admit what we've always known: Everyone's enough of a Genius to fix an iPhone,"" iFixit said on Twitter.Companies like Apple have previously argued their repair policies were in place to ensure the products are properly repaired. ""We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested,"" Apple COO Jeff Williams said in a 2019 release announcing Apple's independent repair shop partner program.On Wednesday, Williams touted Apple's announcement as giving ""customers even more choice if a repair is needed."" He also said the company ""has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we're providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.""Apple said there are more than 2,800 independent repair providers across 200 countries that have access to its parts and repair knowledge. For now, the Self Service Repair program will only be available in the United States at launch, but Apple said it plans to expand the program to other countries over the course of 2022. ",0

As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to court approval, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) said it will create an $18 million fund ""to compensate and make amends to eligible claimants."" Any remaining amount will either be donated to charities focused on harassment, gender equality and women in the video game industry, or will be used to create diversity and inclusion initiatives within the company, it added.""There is no place anywhere at our company for discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind, and I am grateful to the employees who bravely shared their experiences,"" Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement. ""I remain unwavering in my commitment to make Activision Blizzard one of the world's most inclusive, respected, and respectful workplaces,"" he added.In a complaint filed earlier on Monday, the EEOC accused Activision Blizzard of subjecting female employees to sexual harassment and retaliating against them for complaining about harassment. The company also ""discriminated against employees due to their pregnancy,"" the complaint alleged. Kotick said the company will ""continue to be vigilant"" in stamping out harassment and discrimination. ""We thank the EEOC for its constructive engagement as we work to fulfill our commitments to eradicate inappropriate conduct in the workplace,"" he added. The EEOC is one of several agencies to go after Activision Blizzard this year, with the company embroiled in controversy ever since an earlier lawsuit by California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing. That lawsuit, filed in July, alleged a ""frat boy"" work culture where women were subjected to constant discrimination and harassment. It kicked off a storm of dissent from within Activision Blizzard's own workforce that ultimately led to hundreds of employees staging a walkout at the company's offices in Irvine, California. The company is also facing a complaint from the National Labor Relations Board filed earlier this month accusing it of unfair labor practices, as well as an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company said last week it is cooperating with.

100,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Google is making its largest-ever investment in Australia, after a clash with the government that saw the tech giant threaten to shut down search there earlier this year.CEO Sundar Pichai announced Monday that the company would devote 1 billion Australian dollars (about $736 million) to the country over the next five years.The funds will go, in part, toward launching the firm's first research hub in Australia, as well as helping develop the nation's cloud computing sector. Google (GOOGL) also plans to team up with an Australian government agency on scientific research, which will include projects on clean energy and protection of the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, the firm will partner with a local university on quantum computing.Google, which has been in Australia for two decades and now employs nearly 2,000 people locally, said that the new initiative is expected to help create new jobs and spur innovation.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison praised the move Tuesday, calling it ""a $1 billion vote of confidence"" in Australia's economic strategy. Morrison's government has previously outlined plans to turn Australia into ""a top digital economy by 2030,"" working to bolster its capabilities in artificial intelligence, among other areas.Speaking at a Google office in Sydney on Tuesday, Morrison emphasized that the plan ""doesn't mean we're trying to be the next Silicon Valley.""But he said that the company's program would help create more than 6,000 jobs and add about 6.7 billion Australian dollars ($4.9 billion) of value to the economy.""Our challenge, as we emerge from this pandemic in a very challenging world, is to secure Australia's economic recovery,"" Morrison added. ""That is the challenge we face as we move into 2022, and Australia's digital strategy is central to securing that recovery."" Turning the pageGoogle's bet on Australia appears to somewhat reset the complicated relationship it's had with the country's users and government in recent months. The company has in the past publicly tussled with regulators over legislation that requires both Google and Facebook (FB) to pay publishers for news content. For months, Google vehemently argued against the proposed law. At one point last year, it even used its homepage to warn Australians that the proposed law would harm their ability to search and lead to ""consequences"" for YouTube users. Regulators at the time accused the company of spreading ""misinformation.""Tensions came to a head in January, when the company threatened to pull its search engine in the country if the law moved forward.But as a vote on the bill approached, Google took a different tack. It tried to get ahead of the legislation by announcing partnerships with some of the country's largest newsrooms, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NWS) and Seven West Media.Meanwhile, the spotlight largely turned to Facebook, which abruptly banned news content in Australia in February over the proposed law. Facebook later restored access to those pages after Australia made some changes to the code. The law was ultimately passed in February, with Google's strategy cheered by media organizations and politicians alike.Morrison addressed some of the company's past issues on Tuesday, saying ""the fact that Google has decided to invest in the way that they have ... seals [our] partnership.""""We have already worked together with the tech sector on so many fronts, and there are so many more that we need to work on,"" he said.— Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.",0
101,"New York (CNN Business)Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost on Monday announced that he is suing Meta, the social media giant formerly known as Facebook, based on revelations from whistleblower Frances Haugen and the trove of internal company documents she leaked.  The securities lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and other investors, alleges that the company misled the public about its algorithm and the harms the company's own research showed its apps can cause to users. It claims that Facebook-turned-Meta executives violated securities law by making false statements about the ""safety, security and privacy of its platforms"" in order to boost its stock. Meta (FB) shares have fallen around 7% since reporting on Haugen's claims and the internal documents began two months ago, harming investors to the tune of more than $100 billion, according to the lawsuit.""[Meta] repeatedly misrepresented to investors and the public that use of Facebook's products does not harm children, that the Company takes aggressive and effective measures to stop the spread of harmful content, and that Facebook applies its standards of behavior equally to all users,"" the lawsuit alleges.  ""Facebook investors recently learned the truth when former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen, came forward with internal documents showing that Defendants were aware that Facebook's platforms facilitate dissention, illegal activity, and violent extremism, and cause significant harm to users,"" the complaint states. It lists the company, as well as CEO Mark Zuckerberg, CFO David Wehner and vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg as defendants. ""This suit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,"" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business Monday.The Wall Street Journal in September began publishing a series called the ""Facebook Files"" based on the internal documents, which raised concerns about Instagram's effects on teen girls, among other issues. The reporting prompted a Senate subcommittee hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone Davis. Haugen then testified before the Senate subcommittee, during which she said she believes that ""Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.""  The internal documents, which have come to be known as the ""Facebook Papers,"" were provided by Haugen to the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawmakers. A consortium of news organizations, including CNN, reviewed the redacted versions received by Congress. The documents provide the deepest look yet at many of Meta's biggest problems, including with its approach to combating hate speech and misinformation, managing international growth and protecting younger users on its platform. Last month, another former Facebook employee anonymously filed a complaint against the company to the SEC, with allegations similar to Haugen's. The Ohio lawsuit, which was filed Friday, alleges that ""these disclosures erased more than $100 billion in shareholder value and subjected Facebook to immense reputational harm."" Meta (FB) has repeatedly refuted Haugen's claims and said the documents misrepresent the company's research and its actions.""At the heart of these stories is a premise which is false,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to CNN about the Facebook Papers last month. ""Yes, we're a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people's safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie.""In the wake of reporting on the Facebook Papers, the company announced it was changing its name to Meta, a nod to its ambitious plans to build an immersive internet platform called the metaverse. It also made changes to its ad-targeting practices and how it's using facial-recognition software.  Still, members of Congress have since called for Zuckerberg to testify about the documents' findings.Yost's office said in a statement Monday that his lawsuit ""not only seeks to recover that lost value but also demands that Facebook make significant reforms to ensure it does not mislead the public about its internal practices.""

102," (CNN Business)The global chip shortage is making it harder for shoppers to get their hands on some of the most sought after tech gadgets of the holiday season.In the six weeks leading up to Christmas, some of Apple's biggest new products -- including certain iPhone 13 models, some newer iPads and AirPods -- are experiencing delays well into December, depending on model type, colors and the shopper's location, according to analysts and online checks conducted by CNN Business. Last week, some Google Pixel 6 Pro devices were showing late January shipment dates for orders; by Monday, certain models were listed as out of stock on its website. Gaming consoles such as Xbox and PS5 are nearly impossible to find due to delays stemming from Covid-related production challenges and the large gap between supply and demand. The wait times for popular tech products are always changing, but the challenge for shoppers is clear. ""Right now, iPhone 13 and gaming consoles are seeing demand outstrip supply by roughly 20%, which is a telling [sign] for Black Friday and holiday shopping stress,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN Business. ""We have also seen the new AirPods 3 already on back order with shortages into Christmas [week].""The chip shortage, which also has had a major impact on the auto industry, also presents a massive challenge for tech products. For customers, it could require rethinking how early to shop and which specs and products they're willing to live without. For companies, it risks hurting revenue for the all-important holiday sales season and cutting into the sales momentum for some of their recently launched products. Take Apple (AAPL), which is known for having a sophisticated global supply chain to make its products. The iPhone 13, introduced in September, runs on Apple's own A15 Bionic chip, which drives some of its new flagship camera features and an improved battery life. But it also relies on other companies for chips that power certain features, such as displays, power management and USB connectivity. In late October, Apple said chip shortages and manufacturing disruptions tied to Covid-19 slashed $6 billion off its revenue last quarter. It's also reportedly reallocating some of the chips originally planned for iPads to the iPhone to help meet demand. But this means wait times for iPads could get longer.Tech companies such as Samsung (SSNLF) and Microsoft (MSFT) have cited supply chain constraints on recent earnings calls. Some chipmakers have warned that demand will outpace supply through at least 2022.""We are seeing shortages across the board but the premium devices -- which require more chips for power management solutions, micro-controls and certain features -- will be especially hard to find,"" said Gaurav Gupta, a vice president focusing on the semiconductor industry at market research firm Gartner. As of last week, for example, iPhone 13 and iPhone mini models were shipping at faster rates than their Pro counterparts. Apple and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Google, Nintendo and Sony also did not respond to requests for comment.Meanwhile, finding one of the newer gaming consoles -- such as NIntendo Switch OLED, PS5 and XBox Series -- is even harder. All these products are out of stock on their company websites. On Sony's website, shoppers can register ""for an opportunity to purchase"" a PS5 via a special invitation. Some retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy are offering access to ""restock events"" for paying members of their subscription clubs. Amazon, which hasn't been charging for early access to gaming consoles, lets shoppers sign up for text messages when they come back in stock -- before quickly selling out again.Filomena Iovino, research analyst at technology intelligence firm ABI Research, said shoppers may have better luck getting certain products depending on where they live.""Geographically, Apple knows its strongest markets for iPhone sales, and these will be the ones prioritized to receive new product shipments,"" Iovino said. ""This may result in a lack of availability, or delayed availability, in lower-tier markets, but should not impact price.""As a general rule, however, customers everywhere should be prepared to shop early and be flexible. ""If someone wants a tech gadget to give for the holidays, buy it now,"" Gupta added. ""Some items might ship in December; some might get extended to January, depending on the product. The more you customize it, the more difficult it will become to buy that gadget.""",0
103," (CNN)WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it is looking into a consumer report that a Tesla Model Y was involved in an accident while using the company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software.The owner of a 2021 Tesla Model Y reported to the auto safety agency that on Nov. 3 in Brea, California the vehicle was in FSD Beta mode ""and while taking a left turn the car went into the wrong lane and I was hit by another driver in the lane next to my lane.""The car ""gave an alert half way through the turn"" and the driver tried to assume control ""but the car by itself took control and forced itself into the incorrect lane,"" the report says. The car was severely damaged on the driver side, the owner added.""NHTSA is aware of the consumer complaint in question and is in communication with the manufacturer to gather additional information,"" an NHTSA spokesperson told Reuters on Friday.Tesla did not immediately comment.Earlier this month, Tesla recalled nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles because of a communication error that could trigger a false collision warning or unexpected automatic emergency brake.The recall was prompted after a software update to vehicles with FSD Beta. Tesla said more than 99.8% of the vehicles recalled as of Oct. 29 had installed a software update to address the issue and no further action was necessary.FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks but Tesla says does not make vehicles completely autonomous. The features ""require a fully attentive driver,"" it says.Last month, NHTSA raised concerns about how FSD was being used. ""Despite Tesla's characterization of FSD as 'beta,' it is capable of and is being used on public roads,"" NHTSA said.NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot, a different driver assistance software system, after a dozen crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.",0
104," (CNN Business)The biggest news this week in the criminal trial of Elizabeth Holmes is that the government expects to rest its case against the former CEO and founder of failed blood testing company Theranos in a matter of days.In a surprise disclosure after jurors were excused for a long weekend, assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Schenk said the government will likely rest its case against Holmes sometime next week, which will mark the eleventh of the trial and is slated to be a marathon, with court in session all five days. In anticipation, Schenk asked the defense to privately share the first witnesses it expects to call, something the government has been providing to the defense each week but is not disclosed publicly. Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces a dozen federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison. Whether jurors will get to hear from Holmes herself remains an open question. She's listed as a possible defense witness.Here are some other highlights from week 10 of the trial, where court was in session for just two days.Theranos' final lab director testifies Jurors heard from Theranos' final laboratory director, Dr. Kingshuk Das -- the fourth lab director to take the stand in the trial.Like other former employees, Das, a pathologist, testified that he'd been excited to join Theranos, even though he was hired in December 2015, when there was much scrutiny surrounding the company following a damning Wall Street Journal report. He said he still believed in the mission when he was laid off in mid-2018, shortly before Theranos shuttered entirely.Das, who previously worked at UCLA, testified that soon after he was hired, his primary responsibility became addressing a 121-page deficiencies report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services following its audit of the company's lab in the fall of 2015. Das ultimately recommended the company void two years of test results, or roughly 50,000 to 60,000 tests, from its proprietary Edison blood analyzer machines. While Das testified that Holmes didn't push back on voiding the tests, he said she did provide an ""alternative explanation"" for why they should be voided: Quality control issues, not its machines. Das testified he disagreed with that reasoning. Das also testified that Holmes presented an ""alternative explanation"" for why Theranos' device had detected a prostate-specific antigen in women even though women do not have prostates. When he raised the issue to her, she said it may have shown up in some women with breast cancer. Das said he found the explanation ""implausible.""In cross examination of Das, Holmes' defense attorney Lance Wade tried to position him as part of Holmes' effort to overhaul its clinical lab operations, focusing on the latitude that Holmes gave him to dig into and clean up issues. Through Das, Wade pointed the finger at past lab directors, and Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, Theranos' former COO and Holmes' ex-boyfriend who will face the same charges in a separate trial slated to begin next year. (Balwani has pleaded not guilty.) Das, Wade pointed out, reported to Holmes -- one of several structural changes meant to illustrate she was attempting to address problems.The prosecution poked holes in this framing in re-direct examination when Das testified he hadn't been made aware regulators conducted an audit when he interviewed with Holmes for the job, or in his initial weeks at Theranos.A frustrated investor takes the standIt was clear in email exchanges shown in court that Holmes grew to consider early investor Alan Eisenman a nuisance. Eisenman, a retired money manager who took the stand on Wednesday, said his family invested roughly $1.2 million in the company. About $1.1 million of that came in 2006, after he was introduced to Theranos by a friend who was a financial adviser to the Holmes family. ""He told me Elizabeth was brilliant,"" Eisenman said.He testified that Holmes was his source of information about the company. He said there were a number of factors that led to his decision to invest, including that Oracle's Larry Ellison was a board member and investor, that he was told the company had several contracts with major pharmaceutical companies, and revenue projections Holmes provided.For several years, he had quarterly calls with Holmes, but that stopped in mid-2010. Jurors learned that after Eisenman inquired via email about setting up their next call and asked for updated projections on the number of testing cartridges Theranos expected to sell (a metric Holmes had previously provided), the tension was palpable. He didn't get a reply and followed up. Holmes replied: ""June is a tough month for us and I don't know when we can do our next call. As you know, we don't do quarterly calls with our other investors, many of whom invested greater amounts than you did, and I cannot commit to an exact quarterly schedule going forward. As discussed in our call in March, we cannot provide the level of communication you keep requesting."" ""Given your frustration level and our frustration level with this interaction, I strongly encourage you to re-consider the opportunity to realize the return on your investment,"" she continued. Eisenman testified that while he was given the opportunity to exit then, he didn't. He sought information from Theranos' chairman of the board, Donald Lucas. The inquiry was forwarded to Holmes, who reprimanded Eisenman. ""We have communicated about this multiple times before yet you choose to continue going down this path,"" she wrote. Eisenman testified that this outreach on his part ""was not taken very kindly by Elizabeth.""Despite no direct interaction with Holmes thereafter, he received an email to stockholders in late 2013 that the company was raising a new round of financing to help scale to consumers and decided to invest again. Eisenman testified that he'd read a glowing Wall Street Journal opinion article, which has been repeatedly shown in the courtroom, and presumed that its technology was working. When he emailed that he wanted to have a call ahead of investing, despite years of failing to get the company to communicate, Balwani quickly replied and agreed to speak. Eisenman testified that he was shocked by the sudden change. However, the relationship took a turn for the worse again when Eisenman started asking for a business update and possibly exiting his investment. Eisenman is set to resume his testimony next week.High-profile trial hit by yet another delayThis week, a technology issue arose and further delayed the criminal trial by roughly two hours. The court's computer displays used to present exhibits for jurors failed to work Tuesday morning. The court temporarily addressed the problem by setting up a lamp on the witness stand, dimming the lights, and using a projector to display exhibits on a courtroom wall. Judge Edward Davila explained the setup and inquired whether anyone had trouble viewing the exhibits in this manner. One juror excused himself to claim his glasses. ""I'm very embarrassed that our courtroom has had these problems,"" the judge said. The displays were working as normal on Wednesday.Two weeks ago, court was canceled for a day after a water pipe burst near the courthouse, leaving it without water. The coronavirus, Holmes' pregnancy, and other juror issues have resulted in delays in the criminal case. Judge Davila has added court days in November, as well as stretched the number of hours the trial is in session on most days, to make up for lost time. ",0
105," (CNN)The hesitancy of many people to get a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday.""Those who are vaccine hesitant have had their hesitancy enhanced by a variety of things that are happening right now, particularly the unfortunate mix of science and politics,"" Collins said at an event hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than half of respondents -- 54% -- said they would not get the vaccine if it was available for free before the November 3 presidential election. Along party lines, 60% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they would not. Half of Democrats said they would. ""I don't want to have us, a year from now, having a conversation about how we have in our hands the solution to the worst pandemic of more than 100 years, but we haven't been able to actually convince people to take charge of it,"" Collins said.People need to understand that if not enough people get vaccinated, a vaccine won't help reduce the spread of the virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.""It's a combination of how effective a vaccine is and how many people use it,"" he said. ""If you have a vaccine that is highly effective and not enough people get vaccinated, you're not going to realize the full, important effect of having a vaccine.""The less protective a vaccine is, the more people need to get it to provide population-wide immunity, Fauci said.President Donald Trump has said a vaccine could be available before the election November 3, and on Wednesday he said a vaccine could be released by mid-October. Fauci said he still thinks it will be the final months of the year before a vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.''I would still put my money on November/December,"" Fauci said during a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute panel on global pandemics.The CDC head gave a timeline. The President disputed itThe timeline for a Covid vaccine became a major headline Wednesday, when Trump challenged assertions by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Dr. Robert Redfield said earlier that a ""very limited supply"" of a vaccine might be ready in November or December, but it would have to be prioritized for first responders and those at greatest risk for death.""If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at third, late second quarter, third quarter 2021,"" Redfield told a Senate appropriations subcommittee.On top of that, ""in order to have enough of us immunized so we have immunity, I think it's going to take us six to nine months,"" he said.In the meantime, ""These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,"" Redfield said, holding up a blue face mask, adding that masks may offer more protection than a vaccine. Trump said Redfield was ""confused"" in his testimony. ""I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information,"" Trump said about Redfield's vaccine timeline.The President also said Redfield's comments to Congress about masks possibly being more effective than a vaccine were incorrect and that Redfield may have misunderstood the question.""Maybe he misunderstood it,"" Trump said, later adding, ""As far as the masks are concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks.""A CDC spokesman said in a statement that Redfield was answering a question he thought was in regard to the time period in which all Americans would have completed their Covid vaccination, and his estimate was by the second or third quarter of 2021.""He was not referring to the time period when Covid-19 vaccine doses would be made available to all Americans,"" the spokesman said.In a later statement, Redfield said that he believes in the ""importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a Covid-19 vaccine.""Distrust is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spreadDistrust in government agencies is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,"" he said during an American Public Health Association webinar.Surveillance helps public health officials by collecting information on infected people, such as where they were exposed and who they've been in contact with, and the course of their illness. Fauci said the variability in how the coronavirus affects people has helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.""One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently... propagating the outbreak..."" Fauci said during a virtual panel sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Fauci said he has ""never seen anything with a range"" like this virus.""It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,"" he said.7 coronavirus deaths are linked to 1 weddingA wedding in Maine is linked to 176 Covid-19 cases and the deaths of seven people who didn't attend the celebration -- showing just how easily and quickly coronavirus can spread at social gatherings, public health experts say.  For months, doctors have stressed the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. But outbreaks have stemmed from Memorial Day events, Fourth of July celebrations and a massive motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.The wedding in Millinocket on August 7 had about 65 guests, a violation of the state's 50-person limit for indoor events, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.The event is linked to outbreaks that have unfolded at a nursing home and a jail, both more than 100 miles away from the wedding venue, among people who had only secondary or tertiary contact with an attendee. Residents at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center accounted for 39 cases tied to the wedding and six of the seven deaths thus far, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said.""The virus favors gatherings,"" Shah added. ""It does not distinguish between happy events like a wedding celebration, or sad farewells, like a funeral.""Despite such somber warnings, about 1,500 people descended on a New Jersey boardwalk house featured in MTV's ""Jersey Shore"" on Monday night, ending in eight arrests, Seaside Heights police said. The event was organized by a group of YouTube pranksters, according to Seaside Heights Police Detective Steve Korman, and officials say they are now worried about how they will track possible infections among more than a thousand people.Universities try to get ahead of outbreaksOutbreaks keep cropping up at colleges and universities, prompting some to go to virtual learning again. More than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at colleges and universities in all 50 states. Citing a significant rise in cases among students, the University of Colorado Boulder announced a 14-day quarantine period for students living within the city.The University of Arizona is taking a similar approach, urging students to shelter in place until the end of the month after a large number of positive cases. The university reported 261 positive cases on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard.At the University of Missouri, two students were expelled and three were suspended for violating rules that require students who test positive to isolate and comply with social distancing.""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable. We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students,"" the university said in a statement Tuesday.",0
106," (CNN)President Donald Trump knew back in the spring that it would probably take a year to develop a coronavirus vaccine, according to interviews with journalist Bob Woodward.Trump also suggests that's why he initially pushed so hard for the use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, because the malaria drug had already been tested and approved for other uses.""Well, we're doing great on vaccines,"" Woodward quotes Trump as saying in his latest book, ""Rage.""""The problem with a vaccine is a vaccine will take 13 to 14 months once you have it. Because you have to test a vaccine. As opposed to the hydroxy, you have to test it. Because the hydroxy's been there for 25 years.""Hydroxychloroquine was indeed an approved drug, but it had never been tested in people with coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration gave hydroxychloroquine emergency use approval but later rescinded it after several studies showed the drug did not help patients were coronavirus and might be harmful.Trump heavily promoted hydroxychloroquine for months but after the FDA rescinded the EUA, began talking about development of a vaccine. He has repeatedly said he believes a vaccine could be approved before the Nov. 3 election.His interviews with Woodward -- also recorded on audiotapes -- show he was briefed on the timetable for a coronavirus vaccine. The US government had been working with vaccine makers, including Moderna Inc, and Johnson & Johnson, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The new vaccines are made using pieces of genetic material and researchers started testing the first vaccines in human clinical trials in March.""We probably already have the vaccine,"" Trump said on April 13, according to the book. ""You know the biggest problem though? You have to test it, so you have to make sure it kills the virus, but you've got to make sure it doesn't kill the person. Can you imagine? You vaccinate a hundred million people and you find out it's poison, right?""Administration officials have told CNN that in meetings focused on vaccine development throughout the spring and summer, Trump consistently pressed officials to speed up the timeline for developing a vaccine, and the President appeared intent on being able to deliver at least the solid promise of an effective vaccine by the time he faces reelection.Those efforts have scaled up as Election Day nears, and Trump has repeatedly complained that some officials at federal health agencies are actively working to stymie his reelection chances by slow-walking announcements.""It will be delivered before the end of the year, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October,"" Trump said about a vaccine at a rally this month. ""How do you like that? Wouldn't that be nice? And you know why? Not because of the election. It'd be nice because we want to save people.""Trump's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has denied there's pressure on the FDA ""to do anything.""",0
107," (CNN)President Donald Trump has defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic many times before, but on Tuesday he faced his most threatening critics yet — undecided voters.A version of this story appeared in the September 16 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.At an ABC town hall in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, the President hit back at a question over his remarks to renowned journalist Bob Woodward that he deliberately downplayed the threat of the virus, despite knowing the risks.""Well I didn't downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it in terms of action,"" he claimed in response to a question at the town hall. He pointed to his government's travel bans on China and Europe as examples of ""very strong"" action.It was an invitation to the audience to refuse to believe their own ears, as Stephen Collinson writes. Trump repeatedly told Americans the virus would ""just disappear,"" and he privately told Woodward in mid-March: ""I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.""Trump and the White House have been widely criticized for flouting government guidelines designed to limit the transmission of Covid-19, including social distancing and wearing a mask. On Tuesday, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain at the White House to sign normalization agreements between Israel and the two Arab countries.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYChildren from ethnic-minority groups hit harderA new report confirms that while deaths in kids infected with Covid-19 are very rare, children and teens from ethnic-minority groups are disproportionately impacted. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly report Tuesday that while Hispanic, Black, Native American and Asian or Pacific people represented 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age group.If rich countries get the vaccine first, twice as many people will die: studyNew modelling from Northeastern University shows that a coordinated vaccine response that provides countries with a number of doses proportionate to their population will save twice as many lives than if rich countries were prioritized.If the vaccine is distributed based on population numbers, it could avert 61% of global deaths. But if higher numbers of doses are given to wealthier countries, just 33% of deaths could be prevented. The US and China are among nations that have not joined an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine ahead of a deadline on Friday.It may be 2022 before we can start thinking about 'normal life' againThat's the stark warning from the World Health Organization's chief science officer, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, who said there needs to be  60% to 70% of the population with immunity before a dramatic reduction in viral transmission is realistic. ""We're looking at 2022 at least before enough people start getting the vaccine to build immunity.""A WHO special envoy, David Nabarro, also warned that the pandemic has just begun. ""This is really serious -- we're not even in the middle of it yet,"" he told British lawmakers.

A committee on dietary guidelines in the US has recommended that adults limit their sugar intake to around 6 teaspoons a day — less than a can of soda, or around two-and-a-half choc chip cookies. One tip is to replace high-sugar desserts with fresh fruit.

108,"Bordeaux, France (CNN)Dealing with the first wave was like a sprint, the second will be more like a marathon.That's how Dr. Olivier Joannes-Boyau, head of the intensive care unit at University Hospital in the southwestern city of Bordeaux, describes the resurgence of Covid-19 in France. After young French people took advantage of the lifting of lockdown and summer months to socialize freely, Covid-19 hospitalizations have risen in large cities like Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille on the Mediterranean coast. French hospitals are now preparing for the long slog.The last time University Hospital dealt with a rise in Covid-19 cases, it put aside all other emergency procedures to deal the crisis. This time, it is trying to keep the rest of its services going too. Just like the wider country, it is adapting to a virus that looks like it is here to stay.Hospital staff are more experienced than they were when the coronavirus first swept through France, and Bordeaux University Hospital is now armed with steroids to reduce Covid-19 symptoms and improved ventilators, both of which can reduce intubation rates.But juggling the swelling number of Covid-19 patients alongside those with other conditions will be difficult, says Dr. Catherine Fleureau, the hospital's director. ""It's also going to be harder than last time, because this wave, I think, will grow progressively and then last over time.""Earlier this year, the first coronavirus wave spiked fast, but was cut short by a strict nationwide lockdown. In total more than 31,000 people died from the disease in France, out of over 433,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Now, the number of new cases is rising fast. A record was set over the weekend with more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. The number of clusters has been rising steadily and, most worryingly, nationwide, the number of people in intensive care has risen 25% in the past week. That number is still 10 times lower than they it was in the spring but it is a worrying trend; like in the spring it will be about how fast the numbers move upwards.The French government is determined to avoid a second general lockdown that could cripple its economy, so is tasking local authorities with responsibility for reducing the virus's spread.In response, Bordeaux and Marseille have tightened their Covid-19 regulations, extending the places where masks must be worn, limiting the size of public gatherings and hardening enforcement. More checks are to be carried out to ensure that Covid-19 regulations are being respected.In Bordeaux, the plan announced by regional officials includes a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in public parks, along the river banks and on beaches. In cafes and restaurants clients will no longer be able to eat and drink while standing up. In both cities regional officials lowered the number of people allowed to gather for large events to 1,000 from 5,000 previously, resulting in the cancellation of sporting fixtures.And just since the start of the school year, 81 schools and 2,100 classes have had to close due to Covid cases. Minister for Education Jean-Michel Blanquer also said Wednesday 1,200 new infections among students had been recorded, compared to last week. The success of these measures will dictate the number of patients that ultimately reach doctors like Dr. Joannes-Boyau. ""The major problem will be to keep the wave, really low,"" he says. ""Because if this wave grows a lot, we will face a large number of patients with Covid-19 that will come and we will not able to treat them.""It's too early to judge whether local restrictions can keep the coming wave manageable, but his intensive care unit is already nearing capacity, with 33 of the 35 available ICU beds occupied on Wednesday. As Joannes-Boyau says, it takes about three weeks for any change in the state of a population's health to be measurable. Now the city is braced to see if it has the endurance to last the marathon.An earlier version of this story incorrectly understated the number of ICU beds that were occupied in Bordeaux on Wednesday. It was 33.",0
109," (CNN)The deadly coronavirus may have circulated in the United States as early as December, about a month earlier than believed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to researchers with UCLA.Their study, published last Thursday in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, found a statistically significant increase in clinic and hospital visits by patients who reported respiratory illnesses as early as the week of December 22.The first known case of Covid-19 in the US was thought to be a patient in Washington who had visited Wuhan, China, according to the CDC. The case was reported in January. Dr. Joann Elmore and colleagues looked through nearly 10 million medical records from the UCLA Health system, including three hospitals and 180 clinics. Elmore said she started the search after receiving a number of emails from anxious patients in March through her clinic's patient portal at UCLA. Patients kept asking if the cough they had in January could have been Covid-19.""With the outpatients, I found a 50% increase in the percentage of patients coming in complaining of a cough. It came out to over 1,000 extra patients above the average of what we would typically see,"" Elmore told CNN.  The number of patient visits to the ER for respiratory complaints, as well as the number of people hospitalized with acute respiratory failure between December 2019 and February 2020, were all up, compared to records from the past five years. The uptick in cases started in the final week of December. ""Some of these cases could have been due to the flu, some could be for other reasons, but to see these kinds of higher numbers even in the outpatient setting is notable,"" Elmore said.Elmore hopes the research shows that real-time data collected on diseases like this could potentially help public health experts identify and track emerging outbreaks much earlier and potentially slow or stop the spread of disease.Dr. Claudia Hoyen, an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center who did not work on the study, said she believes it's possible Covid-19 may have been in the US much sooner than first realized.But Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research, disagreed.""We know from the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that the pandemic started in late November / early December in China so there's absolutely no way the virus could have been spreading widely in December 2019. From the same genetic data we know that widespread transmission didn't start in the United States until (around)  February 2020,"" Andersen said in an email.""The paper is picking up spurious signals and the hospitalizations are more likely from flu or other respiratory diseases,"" Andersen wrote. Parties and virus concerns keep high schoolers from returning to class Overcrowded parties have forced several high schools to go back to online learning in hopes of staving off Covid-19 outbreaks.Two of those schools are in Massachusetts, which is reporting fewer cases than last week, and New York, which has maintained an infection rate less than 1% for 38 days. Although the states' numbers are promising, experts have warned that people attending large gatherings are a serious threat to managing the spread of the virus that has infected more than 6.5 million and killed 195,275 people in the US.Student parties have already sent colleges and universities scrambling to manage outbreaks, and now high school administrators are working to avoid the same. A crowded student party ""that involved alcohol and complete lack of safety precautions"" pushed Lincoln-Sudbury High School outside of Boston to go back to remote learning the first two weeks of school, a letter from the superintendent said. And Pelham High School in Westchester, New York, has extended online learning after two nights in a row of students partying in the woods, the school district announced.But students' social lives are not the only cause for concern. The president of the United Federation of Teachers said Monday that New York City is ""not making the grade"" when it comes to enacting the safety measures needed to reopen schools for in-person learning.Michael Mulgrew cited insufficient staffing and a two to three day delay in testing results as major roadblocks.""If you asked me if we are ready to open today, I would say we are not,"" he said. In New York City Public Schools, at least 422,190 students have requested the entirely remote learning option for the fall, according to data provided by the city's Department of Education -- a little over 40% of the more than 1 million students enrolled in the nation's largest public school system. Roughly 58% of students plan to return to school buildings as part of a hybrid learning model beginning next week, according to the department.Parents in the New York City public school system could opt out of the in-person hybrid plan since it was first announced. In August, Mayor Bill de Blasio said 74% of families had said they were planning to participate in in person learning at the time. The city's daily Covid-19 indicators are all under desired thresholds, de Blasio said Tuesday.Schools plan ahead for safe reopeningsAs several schools make last minute changes to their plans in response to parties, others are implementing systems ahead of time to respond to changes in the virus. Kentucky officials outlined a color-coded system Monday to help individual districts determine every week if they should continue with in-person learning based on coronavirus levels in their area. ""If you're in the red, it means there's widespread community spread of COVID-19, and if you're in the red it's not responsible -- it is not responsible -- to be doing every day in-person learning,"" Gov. Andy Beshear said.And though students in the Los Angeles Unified School District are still learning remotely, a ""report card"" will show the number of cases in each school as part of the district's testing and tracing endeavor, Superintendent Austin Beutner said. To address childcare concerns, about 3,000 children of essential workers will be able to return to school in groups of six after being tested for the virus, Beutner said. States cracking down on large gatheringsSome states are doing their part to curb the spread and limit the number of fall and winter infections by cracking down on large gatherings. Officials from New York City parks and New York University are patrolling Washington Square Park and encouraging personal protective equipment use after two back to back weekends of parties with NYU students. After the first weekend gathering, Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the city's police and the university officials for not taking firmer action to stop the parties. NYU has instructed all residents and employees the Rubin Hall dormitory to quarantine until at least Tuesday night after the diagnosis of six positive cases out of roughly 400 students living in the building, the university announced in its latest campus update.""Out of an abundance of caution, we are also retesting all residents of Rubin Hall (and employees, too), and instructed them on Saturday to begin quarantining until at least Tuesday night,"" the university said. NYU has reported a total of 65 cases since August 1, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard — an overall positivity rate of .19%. The school has reported 48 cases in the most recent 14-day period, a positivity rate of .31%.The University of Missouri in Columbia has expelled two students and suspended three others for violating the school's Covid-19 rules, including ""requirements that COVID positive individuals isolate and comply with social distancing requirements,"" the university said Tuesday. ""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable,"" Chancellor and UM System President Mun Choi said in a statement, without elaborating on their alleged actions.""We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students.""MU has referred roughly 470 students to the Office of Student Conduct for possible Covid-19 safety violations since August 16, and 11 student organizations are currently under investigation. MU has 332 active cases among students, according to the university dashboard -- down from 700 active cases earlier this month. The school has reported more than 1,300 cases since August 19. On Monday, the University of Arizona -- in accordance with the local county health department -- strongly urged students to shelter in place until September 30, following an increase in positive Covid-19 cases.Exceptions include obtaining food, attending work, seeking medical treatment and going outside where social distancing is possible. The school limited in-person instruction to ""essential courses"" only until September 27. The University of Arizona reported 261 positive Covid-19 tests on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard, and has seen roughly 1,400 cases since July 31.Pennsylvania appealing court ruling on large gatherings In the face of possible fall and winter resurgence, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's office is appealing a federal court ruling that keeps the state from banning certain types of large gatherings. The state has instituted measures against indoor gatherings of more than 25 people and outdoor events with more than 250 people to stop the spread of coronavirus.The action is used by many governors across the US, said Wolf's press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger, and continues to ""save lives in the absence of federal action.""Connecticut has also had ordinances in place to prohibit large gatherings and require face masks in the time of coronavirus, but now law enforcement will have the authority to impose fines to enforce them, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday.People not wearing masks can be fined $100. Organizers of large gatherings can be fined $500, with those attending fined $250, Lamont said.Despite the importance of masks to halting the spread, White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said a national mask mandate ""probably would not work.""Speaking at a news conference with Vermont Gov. Phil Scott on Tuesday, Fauci said, ""There is such a degree of variability of accepting mandates throughout the country.""Fauci said issues arise when a majority of the population in an area do not agree with the mandate -- and that begs the question: How do you enforce the mandate?Anything that puts an ""authoritative statement to the citizenry often is met with a considerable amount of pushback,"" he said. Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, said in Geneva that countries approaching winter will have to choose between having bars and nightclubs open or schools in session.""We have to sustain pressure on this virus, we have to reduce transmission at community level in order to lower the risk to those older and vulnerable people and to maintain an environment in which our children can continue to attend school,"" Ryan said at a briefing.""So, what is more important? Are children back at school? Are the nightclubs and the bars open?"" he said. ""I think these are decisions that we have to make in coming into the winter months."" ",0
110," (Kaiser Health News)The Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to follow British regulators in resuming a coronavirus vaccine trial that was halted when a participant suffered spinal cord damage, even as the National Institutes of Health has launched an investigation of the case.""The highest levels of NIH are very concerned,"" said Dr. Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director and a leader of viral research at the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an NIH division. ""Everyone's hopes are on a vaccine, and if you have a major complication the whole thing could get derailed.""A great deal of uncertainty remains about what happened to the unnamed patient, to the frustration of those avidly following the progress of vaccine testing. AstraZeneca, which is running the global trial of the vaccine it produced with Oxford University, said the trial volunteer recovered from a severe inflammation of the spinal cord and is no longer hospitalized.AstraZeneca has not confirmed that the patient was afflicted with transverse myelitis, but Nath and another neurologist said they understood this to be the case. Transverse myelitis produces a set of symptoms involving inflammation along the spinal cord that can cause pain, muscle weakness and paralysis. Britain's regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, reviewed the case and has allowed the trial to resume in the United Kingdom.AstraZeneca ""need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people,"" said Nath. ""We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so.""Any decision about whether to continue the trial is complex because it's difficult to assess the cause of a rare injury that occurs during a vaccine trial — and because scientists and authorities have to weigh the risk of uncommon side effects against a vaccine that might curb the pandemic.""So many factors go into these decisions,"" Nath said. ""I'm sure everything is on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt healthy people.""The NIH has yet to get tissue or blood samples from the British patient, and its investigation is ""in the planning stages,"" Nath said. U.S. scientists could look at samples from other vaccinated patients to see whether any of the antibodies they generated in response to the coronavirus also attack brain or spinal cord tissue.Such studies might take a month or two, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it would take before it decides whether to move forward.Dr. Jesse Goodman, a Georgetown University professor and physician who was chief scientist and lead vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency will review the data and possibly consult with British regulators before allowing resumption of the U.S. study, which had just begun when the injury was reported. Two other coronavirus vaccines are also in late-stage trials in the U.S.If it determines the injury in the British trial was caused by the vaccine, the FDA could pause the trial. If it allows it to resume, regulators and scientists surely will be on the watch for similar symptoms in other trial participants.A volunteer in an earlier phase of the AstraZeneca trial experienced a similar side effect, but investigators discovered she had multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccination, according to Dr. Elliot Frohman, director of the Multiple Sclerosis & Neuroimmunology Center at the University of Texas.Neurologists who study illnesses like transverse myelitis say they are rare — occurring at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250,000 people — and strike most often as a result of the body's immune response to a virus. Less frequently, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines.The precise cause of the disease is key to the decision by authorities whether to resume the trial. Sometimes an underlying medical condition is ""unmasked"" by a person's immune response to the vaccine, leading to illness, as happened with the MS patient. In that case, the trial might be continued without fear, because the illness was not specific to the vaccine.More worrisome is a phenomenon called ""molecular mimicry."" In such cases, some small piece of the vaccine may be similar to tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on that tissue in response to a vaccine component. Should that be the case, another occurrence of transverse myelitis would be likely if the trial resumed, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A second case would shut down the trial, he said.In 1976, a massive swine flu vaccination program was halted when doctors began diagnosing a similar disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, in people who received the vaccine. At the time no one knew how common GBS was, so it was difficult to tell whether the episodes were related to the vaccine.Eventually, scientists found that the vaccine increased the risk of the disorder by an additional one case among every 100,000 vaccinated patients. Typical seasonal flu vaccination raises the risk of GBS in about one additional case in every 1 million people.""It's very, very hard"" to determine if one rare event was caused by a vaccine, Schaffner said. ""How do you attribute an increased risk for something that occurs in one in a million people?""Before allowing U.S. trials to restart, the FDA will want to see why the company and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) in the U.K. felt it was safe to continue, Goodman said. The AstraZeneca trial in the United States has a separate safety board.FDA officials will need to review full details of the case and may request more information about the affected study volunteer before deciding whether to allow the U.S. trial to continue, Goodman said. They may also require AstraZeneca to update the safety information it provides to study participants.It's possible that the volunteer's health problem was a coincidence unrelated to the vaccine, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Studies aren't usually stopped over a single health problem, even if it's serious.Yet many health leaders have expressed frustration that AstraZeneca hasn't released more information about the health problem that led it to halt its U.K. trial.""There is just so little information about this that it's impossible to understand what the diagnosis was or why the DSMB and sponsor were reassured"" that it was safe to continue, Goodman said.AstraZeneca has said it's unable to provide more information about the health problem, saying this would violate patient privacy, although it didn't say how.But there's an exceptional need for transparency in a political climate rife with vaccine hesitancy and mistrust of the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 response, leading scientists say.""While I respect the critical need for patient confidentiality, I think it would be really helpful to know what their assessment of these issues was,"" Goodman said. ""What was the diagnosis? If there wasn't a clear diagnosis, what is it that led them to feel the trial could be restarted? There is so much interest and potential concern about a COVID-19 vaccine that the more information that can be provided, the more reassuring that would be.""The FDA will need to balance any possible risks from an experimental vaccine with the danger posed by COVID-19, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.""There are also potential consequences if you stop a study,"" Goodman said.If the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the U.S. government is supporting six other COVID vaccines in the hope at least one will succeed. The potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine show this to be a wise investment, Adalja said.""This is part of the idea of not having just one vaccine candidate going forward,"" he said. ""It gives you a little more insurance.""Schaffner said researchers need to remember that vaccine research is unpredictable.""The investigators have inadvisedly been hyping their own vaccine,"" Schaffner said. ""The Oxford investigators were out there this summer saying, 'We're going to get there first.' But this is exactly the sort of reason ... Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and the rest of us have been saying, 'You never know what will happen once you get into large-scale human trials.'""",0
111," (CNN)Children and teens from minority groups are disproportionately hit by coronavirus, just as older adults are, according to the findings of a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children from ethnic and racial minorities, those with underlying health conditions and those between the ages of 18 and 20 are more likely to die, a CDC-led research team wrote in a study published Tuesday in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.  The report also showed just how unusual it is for children and young adults to die from coronavirus. Among the 190,000 deaths tallied in the country, only 0.08% -- or 121 -- were reported in those under 21. The most updated report from the CDC shows 377 children, teens and young adults aged up to 24 have died from coronavirus. The researchers asked 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands to submit information on coronavirus deaths in those under 21, between February 12 and July 31. Forty-seven jurisdictions responded. Among the approximately 6.5 million Covid-19 cases in the country, the researchers found a total of 391,814 cases of Covid-19 and MIS-C in those under 21. While people under 21 make up 26% of the US population, they make up only 8% of all reported cases.  Hispanics, Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives were disproportionately affected.  A total of 44% of the 121 who died were Hispanic children, 29% were Black children, 4% were American Indian/Alaska Natives and 4% were Asian or Pacific Islander. While these groups represent 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age range. Fourteen percent of the deaths were in white children. ""Infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, particularly those from racial and ethnic minority groups at higher risk, those with underlying medical conditions, and their caregivers, need clear, consistent, and developmentally, linguistically, and culturally appropriate COVID-19 prevention messages,"" the researchers wrote. While 25% of the deaths were in previously healthy children, 75% had at least one underlying health condition and 45% had two or more. The most frequently reported medical conditions were chronic lung disease, including asthma; obesity; neurologic and developmental conditions and cardiovascular conditions.  The breakdown among the different age groups varied substantially, with those in the younger age groups doing better than adolescents and young adults. Approximately 10% of the deaths were in infants under the age of 1, an additional 9% were in children between 1 and 4, with another 11% in the 5-9 range and 10% in the 10-13 range. But almost 20% of the deaths were seen in teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 and more than 40% were in 18 to 20 year-olds.  This matches up somewhat with earlier CDC statistics that found 0 to 4-year-olds are four times less likely to be hospitalized and nine times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds, and 5 to 17-year-olds are nine times less likely to be hospitalized and 16 times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds.  Boys fared worse than girls: males accounted for 63% of the deaths compared with 37% for females.  Even though children are reassuringly less likely to get severely ill and die, they can still get infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, according to numerous studies.  For example, in one study published last week in the MMWR, researchers analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care facilities in Salt Lake County from April to July. They found at least two children who had no symptoms not only caught the virus, but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One eight-month-old baby infected both parents.  ""The infected children exposed at these three facilities had mild to no symptoms. Two of three asymptomatic children likely transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to their parents and possibly to their teachers,"" the researchers from the Salt Lake County Health Department wrote in their report. Another study out of South Korea analyzed data on 91 asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic children diagnosed with Covid-19 between February 18 and March 31 at 22 centers throughout that country. It found that 22% of the children were asymptomatic. The study was published at the end of August in JAMA Pediatrics. ""This highlights the concept that infected children may be more likely to go unnoticed either with or without symptoms and continue on with their usual activities, which may contribute to viral circulation within their community,"" wrote two doctors from Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, in an accompanying editorial.  The CDC researchers of the current study said it is important to keep a close eye on children infected with Covid-19. ""Although infants, children, and adolescents are more likely to have milder COVID-19 illness than are adults, complications, including MIS-C and respiratory failure, do occur in these populations. Persons infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be followed closely so that clinical deterioration can be detected early,"" they wrote. ",0
112," (CNN)Eli Lipman, 9, and his father have been battling the impact of Covid-19 since March, and he said life as a ""long hauler"" isn't easy.""Kids, I'm sorry to say this, but it is a big deal. It will hurt,"" Eli told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday. ""You just got to face the truth: Sometimes you're not OK.""Eli and his father, Jonathan Lipman, are among a growing population of people who have been deemed ""long haulers"" -- people who are diagnosed with coronavirus and experience symptoms for months.Though research has found children face a small risk of severe illness from coronavirus.Eli described being achy, sore and tired. He said he felt like he ""got smashed into a wall.""But as fatigued as he is and as much as he wants to, Eli told Cuomo he can't sleep.""My body is just like 'nope,'"" Eli said.Lipman said doctors initially brushed Eli and his illnesses off many times. First in their diagnosis, then when their symptoms persisted and even when Eli's temperature stayed at a low-grade fever for months. ""No one would really believe us that we were still sick, and when you keep being not believed you stop believing yourself,"" Lipman said.Lipman is still fighting the symptoms, too. He said most mornings he wakes up with aches similar to when he broke his shoulder. He can't go up the stairs without gasping and can't even cook dinner for his family like he so enjoys doing, because he falls asleep.Dr. William Li, who is researching long-hauler patients, said that while there is still so much more to learn, the problem likely involves the blood vessels. ""One of the important things is to keep talking to your doctor, and doctors need to keep listening to your patients,"" Li said. ""There is really something unfolding before our eyes that we need before our eyes that we need to actually come together with our patients and with ourselves as researchers and as doctors to try to help heal.""Li recommended that, in addition to regular conversation with doctors, long haulers need to get as much sleep, movement and leafy greens as possible.",0
113," (CNN)Sibling rivalry is often taken as an unexamined fact of family life -- as much a part of parenting as potty training or bedtime stories.But experts say parents don't have to put up with the bickering and the fights: There are strategies and techniques to help brothers and sisters get along better, strengthening a relationship that will support them for life and make for a more harmonious home.Given the enforced proximity that is still a reality for many during the Covid-19 pandemic, a game plan to improve sibling relationships could be a lifesaver for struggling parents tired of snarled insults and hurled objects. ""It's been part of our culture, at least in the US, to think that siblings fight. That there's going to be lots of times they don't get along. That's what they do,"" said Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University in Boston.""When social lives are so restricted, families really see the value of encouraging their kids to be friends, in some respects, to be companions and playmates.""Unlike many of our relationships, we don't choose our siblings, and this makes for a unique dynamic. Brothers and sisters can withstand far more negativity and behavior that simply wouldn't fly among friends, Kramer said. That's one reason why sibling interactions are developmentally so important. These relationships allow children to try out new social and emotional behavior, particularly when it comes to conflict, helping them learn ways to manage emotions and develop awareness of other people's thoughts and feelings.""It's helpful for children to have experiences in a very safe relationship with a brother or sister where they can work through (conflict) and learn conflict management skills that they will be able to use in other relationships in their life,"" Kramer said.  ""Conflict can be very constructive and helpful. It helps children get a sense of who they are and their own identity.""It's worth parents spending some time to help their children get along since these are typically the longest-lasting of our close relationships. That shared history can be really important in a crisis.  So what steps should you take to help feuding siblings get along? Here are some ideas. One-on-one timeIt may sound counterintuitive, but scheduling regular one-on-one time with your children is a good first move. ""When you have one-on-one time there is no competition for your attention. There are no perceived winners and losers in this regard,"" said family therapist Jonathan Caspi, a professor in the department of family science and human development at Montclair State University in New Jersey.""There is the ability to praise and correct without the audience (and it having any meaning) for the other children. It's a freer relationship and one in which bonding and closeness can be developed without interference,"" he said via email.Another tip: While it's tempting to seize the moments they do get along to get things done, it's important to take a moment and praise siblings when they are cooperating and playing nicely -- parent the good behavior as well as the bad. Intervene or ignore?Tougher to deal with are the fights and knowing when to intervene or not. As a rule, Caspi said, it's better to ignore simple bickering. However, he stressed that physical violence and the name calling that often precedes it should be policed.""Since violence escalates incrementally in its severity, it is important that parents stop verbal violence before it becomes physical. Name calling is violence and opens the door for escalation into more severe violence.""""Do not allow your children to call each other curse words or negative terms like 'fat,' 'stupid,' 'icky,' etc.  While physical wounds heal, verbal ones can last a lifetime."" Children under the age of 8 don't usually have the skills to manage conflict, said Kramer, who encouraged parents to act as mediators or coaches to facilitate solving the problem at hand rather than serving as a referee. ""What happens when parents do nothing and don't intervene is that children can get the message that parents think what you're doing is OK. That it's all right to keep on at one another,"" she said.""We encourage parents to intervene to help children manage conflict on their own.""For example, Kramer suggested saying something along the following line: ""I'm hearing some scuffling. I'm hearing some conflict. I'd like for the two of you to work this out together. If you need some help, I'm down the hall but let's see what you can do on your own.""It was once thought that girls used more verbal aggression than boys, Caspi said, but research is suggesting that sisters are just as apt to use physical violence as much as brothers. ""The difference may be how severe the physical violence gets. Boys tend to do more damage, particularly when older,"" he said via email. ""It was also assumed that girls relied more on relational aggression (e.g., strategies to socially humiliate, isolating, injure reputation) than boys. However, there is evidence that brothers use this approach about the same too.""What not to doThe danger with intervening or involving yourself in children's disagreements is that it can backfire and fuel the fighting. Parents tend to intervene on behalf of the younger child, which builds more resentment in the older and empowers the younger to challenge the older more frequently, Caspi said. Avoid phrases like  ""You're bigger, be nice!"" ""Be a good role model,"" or ""She's little, let her have the toy.""""Another reason for bickering is parents who make lots of comparisons. Parents should avoid comparing their children. Children hear the comparisons and it creates more competition and fighting,"" he said. It's also important to take complaints seriously. For example, if a child consistently complains, ""It's not fair"" -- something I find particularly challenging in dealing with my own daughters.""When children complain about fairness, parents often dismiss it ... which only confirms the sense that they are on the outside in the parent-children relationship. Acknowledge the feelings and openly discuss it,"" Caspi said.""Parents should observe how they intervene in sibling conflicts. Are you taking one's side more than the other's?  If so, change it up,"" he said. Lastly, and perhaps most crucially, both Caspi and Kramer said that it's important for parents to cut themselves some slack and take care of their own mental health. Kids can pick up on stress and tension, and this may lead to more fights.""Parents are stretched in so many different ways right now,"" Kramer said.",0
114," (CNN)Dr. Umair Shah remembers the last mass vaccination campaign the US waged.  It was in 2009, when the H1N1 ""swine"" flu broke out in April, right at the end of the regular flu season. ""That was very challenging,"" Shah, who heads the Harris County, Texas, health department, told CNN. ""There were a lot of moving pieces. It took several weeks to months to not just organize but to implement and to do safely and effectively. And that was a mild pandemic."" This is not a mild pandemic. And while vaccine manufacturers, public health experts and the federal government are all confident one or more of the coronavirus vaccines being tested now will be shown to work safely by the end of the year, the US and the world will still be a long way from ending the pandemic. ""I feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this calendar year, as we get into early 2021,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, who, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is helping lead the medical battle against the virus, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual,"" Fauci added. ""Having"" a vaccine does not mean having a vaccine approved, distributed and into the arms of more than 300 million Americans.First, any vaccine must either be approved or authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. That's a process that under normal circumstances can take months or years. While the FDA has promised a speedier process for a Covid-19 vaccine, it must still go through a committee known as the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBAC. The FDA will almost certainly allow a shortcut process known as emergency use authorization, or EUA, but the agency has said it will require an ""EUA-plus"" that adds at least some layers of scrutiny. ""It's unlikely that a Covid-19 vaccine will receive full approval and broad distribution right away. Instead, the FDA will probably authorize vaccines for use in targeted groups of people at high risk from Covid and most likely to benefit from the vaccine,"" Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, both former FDA commissioners, wrote in a commentary in the Wall Street Journal Monday. ""All this means that at least initially, Covid vaccines won't provide the sort of herd immunity that can help extinguish an epidemic.""  That will take time -- likely well into next year, even if a vaccine were to be authorized in January, most experts who spoke to CNN predicted. ""People can't be lulled into a false sense of security by knowing the vaccine is coming,"" Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, told CNN. Although manufacturers are already making vaccine doses, it takes time. And the US will likely need more than 600 million doses of vaccine -- enough for everyone to get two doses of the vaccine. A new vaccine, and a plan for getting it out""Let's say ... at the end of the year, there will be millions and tens of millions of doses available,"" Fauci said in the CNN interview Friday.   ""It won't be until we get into 2021 that you'll have hundreds of millions of doses, and just the logistics constraints in vaccinating large numbers of people -- it's going to take months to get enough people vaccinated to have an umbrella of immunity over the community."" The US just is not ready for a mass vaccination campaign like the one needed to bring coronavirus under control, public health experts agreed. ""I don't think it's going to be seamless,"" said Plescia. The biggest mass vaccination program the US undertakes every year is the annual influenza vaccine. Only about half of Americans get a flu vaccine, and manufacturers make and distribute fewer than 150 million doses of it. Yet it takes a full year from start to finish to formulate, make and distribute flu vaccines every influenza season.  ""We start planning for flu vaccines in January or February,"" Michael Einhorn, the president of Dealmed, an independent medical supply distributor covering New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Flu vaccines generally become available in August -- seven to eight months later. And that's with a vaccine made using familiar technology, and dispensed in ways that people are familiar with -- in pediatricians' offices, at pharmacies, in grocery stores and at clinics.  ""You have a playbook for influenza,"" Shah said. ""This is not the same."" Any coronavirus vaccines will involve new technology and a whole new process for distribution, administration and then for payment. And while anyone can walk into, say, a pharmacy, get a flu shot and leave without ever thinking about it again, coronavirus vaccines will involve a whole lot more trouble and paperwork. People will probably need at least two doses about a month apart. Someone will have to track and follow up on that. ""We have to be able to see who has been vaccinated and who has not been,"" Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, told a public hearing about vaccine distribution organized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Paperwork and red tape ""To have two doses means that you provide the initial dose and we will need to bring the person back for a second dose a month later,"" Dr. Jinlene Chan, acting deputy secretary of public health for the state of Maryland, told CNN. And it's very likely that vaccines made by several different companies will be in use by next year. ""We have to make sure that we give the person the same vaccine for their second dose that they got for their first dose,"" Chan said. No vaccination program can start until there are plans in place to manage this. Plus, the coronavirus vaccine or vaccines will still be experimental, so every person who gets one will need to be tracked to make sure there are no adverse reactions. There is no plan yet for any of this. ""We have gotten very little information on how this is going to roll out,"" said Harris County's Shah. ""That makes it even more difficult to plan.""  One big potential stumbling block is what's known as the cold chain. The two vaccines furthest along in development both must be kept frozen. Moderna's vaccine must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius), while Pfizer's must be kept at -94 F (-70 C). While -4 isn't much colder than the optimal home freezer's setting of 0 degrees F, -94 is more of a challenge. ""Throughout -- from every single point the vaccine has to traverse -- we have to maintain it at that temperature. Otherwise, there is a risk of some degradation and the vaccine possibly becoming less effective,"" Chan said. ""We need to make sure that there is some capability to store it appropriately until it is ready to use."" Otherwise, a thawed batch could mean hundreds or even thousands of people get a dud vaccine. This can be a challenge, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a vaccine expert at Emory University. ""We simply don't have freezers that can reach minus 70 degrees in most clinics,"" he told the National Academies meeting. To reach enough people, any mass vaccination effort will have to go beyond clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. ""You are going to have to get out to communities. You are going to have to get out to places of work,"" Del Rio said. That makes keeping the vaccines cold enough more of a challenge. Plescia said Pfizer has a plan to help keep its vaccine cold. ""Pfizer is going to have special boxes they ship the vaccines in, packed with dry ice,"" he said. ""Once you get the box, it'll keep the stuff at negative 80 degrees for 10 days."" But it's not clear, Plescia said, if the boxes could be opened and a few doses of vaccine taken out safely. ""Even if these boxes work very well, it is still going to add a whole level of challenge,"" he said. Taking the mass out of mass vaccinationPast mass vaccination efforts have been just that -- mass. But coronavirus is a respiratory disease, and the last thing anyone should be doing is lining people up or packing them into, say, school gyms to get vaccinated, Chan noted. ""With mass vaccination clinics, it involves bringing large groups of people into a site and vaccinating as many people as possible,"" Chan said. ""How do we do that in a way that reduces the risk of transmitting the very disease that we trying to vaccinate against?""  Illinois' Ezike said some of the experience with test sites may help. ""We had these strike teams,"" she said. ""We have been able to convert a lot of different sites into sites where people can drive up. Can you do a vaccination through the [car] window?"" she asked.  But to accommodate that, cities and states will have to get busy soon. ""We are going to need additional providers,"" she told the NASEM meeting. ""We need mass vaccination clinics and sites. So we really want to recruit lots and lots of essential partners,"" she added -- especially for the communities that are hardest hit by the pandemic, including meat-packing facilities and remote rural areas. That means changes in policies and legislation -- another potentially time-consuming process. Medical practice is legislated by states, not by the federal government. ""We know that we'll need some expanded scope of practice for different professional groups,"" she said. For instance, states may want to enable dentists, dental hygienists and even medical school students and veterinarians to vaccinate people. And that requires some other levels of legislation so that providers can get paid for their time. Changes to health insurance laws may be necessary, including billing codes that provide for a system under which people get vaccinated for no charge. Because rollout will not be immediate, people will be vaccinated in groups. The National Academies is considering this, as is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). They, along with private advocacy groups, have already released their own draft blueprints that in general put health care workers, first responders and the most vulnerable at the front of the line. But that's another layer of management for governments to take on. Many states have old and unwieldy systems for managing all of this, and Ezike said the needed upgrades may take time. Immunity takes time Adding to the timeline is simple biology. The Pfizer and Modern vaccines, at least, will have to be given in two doses, a month apart. After that, it takes about two weeks for immunity to build. That makes for six weeks from the time someone first gets vaccinated to when they can feel safe from infection.  On top of all of this, many Americans are fearful of vaccines -- especially a new one and especially a new vaccine rolled out in a time of intense politicization of the process. ""There's general vaccination mistrust and then there's government mistrust,"" Ezike noted. The current atmosphere over mask use has not helped, added Harris County's Shah. ""We have made it a political fight,"" he said. ""When you make it political in nature, not driven by health and medical considerations, ultimately people will take sides."" Unless a majority of the population gets vaccinated, the virus will continue its spread. Most estimates suggest that 60% to 70% of the population must be immune to provide enough herd immunity to interrupt the spread of the virus. Polls indicate that only about half of Americans feel confident right now about being vaccinated.  And if vaccines are less than fully effective, that may mean even more of the population needs to be vaccinated to have an effect on spread. Then there are the unknowns. ""Testing has not been seamless at all. There are going to be some glitches,"" Plescia said. ""I think there is a good chance there is going to be a vaccine that works and gets us out of this, but it is hard to believe that it is going to go really smoothly, given all the things that could happen."" Shah is ready for unpleasant surprises. ""This is a super slick virus that has broken every rule in the book,"" he said.",0
115," (CNN)Many of us hope to escape who we were in high school -- particularly if you were last in line to be picked in gym class -- but a growing body of research suggests that how popular you are in adolescence has a link with psychological and physical health decades later. Thirteen-year-olds who weren't very popular with their peers growing up, a new study released Tuesday has found, seem to have a heightened risk of developing circulatory system disease in later life. This includes higher risk for conditions such as narrowed and hardened arteries and abnormal heartbeat that affect the normal functioning of the heart and blood vessels. ""Although not many realize it, peer status is one of the strongest predictors of later psychological and health outcomes, even decades later, said Mitch Prinstein, the John Van Seters distinguished professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina. ""Several early studies revealed that our likeability among peers in grade school predicts life outcomes more strongly than does IQ, parental income, school grades, and pre-existing physical illness,"" Prinstein, who wasn't involved with the research, said. Prinstein, and the authors of the study, said that it's important to note that peer status is a specific form of popularity -- likeability rather than being the cool kid.  ""Many would perhaps think of high-status kids as those who were highly visible and influential -- hanging out in the smoking area during breaks and partying during the weekends. That is another type of popularity, which is sometimes referred to as perceived popularity,"" said Ylva Almquist, an associate professor and senior lecturer at the department of public health sciences at Stockholm University and an author of the study, which published in the journal BMJ Open. ""Peer status is rather an indicator of likability, and the degree to which a child is accepted and respected by their peers.""Chronic health problems are usually explained by genetic factors or actions like smoking, drinking or an unhealthy diet, but research has suggested that high-quality relationships are a key indicator of mortality. Observational studyIn this study from Sweden, the researchers used data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, which includes everyone born in 1953 and residing in Stockholm, the Swedish capital, in 1963.The health of 5,410 men and 5,990 women was tracked into their 60s. At age 13, they had been asked who among their classmates they preferred to work with. They used the results to determine ""peer group status,"" which they divided into four categories: zero nominations, which they termed ""marginalized""; one (""low status""); two or three (""medium status""); and four or more (""high status""). Thirty-three percent of the boys enjoyed high peer group status at the age of 13, slightly more than girls (28.5%), the researchers found. Some 16% of the girls were classed as ""marginalized,"" compared to 12% of boys.  Circulatory disease was more common among the men than it was among the women, but the children classed as ""marginalized"" at age 13 had a 33% to 34% higher risk of circulatory disease in adulthood in both sexes, the study found. In their analysis, the researchers said they accounted for factors such as number and position of siblings, parental education and mental health, socioeconomic conditions, and school factors, such as intellect, academic performance and any criminal behavior.But as an observational study, it can only show a link, and Almquist said there could be many explanations for the association. ""A common dilemma in this kind of research is that we have the information we need to establish associations between conditions in childhood and health outcomes in adulthood, but we know quite little about whatever is happening in between,"" Almquist said.Potential for chronic inflammation due to stressKatherine Ehrlich, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Georgia, who wasn't involved in the research, said one explanation could be chronic inflammation linked to stressful experiences of relationships, both in adolescence and in adulthood. ""It is plausible that stressful social experiences (like being socially isolated) could lead to persistent unresolved inflammation, and if these levels are sustained over time, that could increase one's risk for plaques in the arteries, heart attacks, and other cardiovascular problems,"" said Ehrlich, who wasn't involved in the research.""It seems likely that health behaviors also play a role in the progression from low peer status to circulatory diseases decades later. Individuals who are socially isolated may be more likely to have unhealthy diets, engage in excessive drinking, and lead sedentary lifestyles, all of which could also increase one's risk for cardiovascular problems.""There is also an evolutionary logic, according to Prinstein, who is also the author of ""Popularity: Finding Happiness and Success in a World That Cares Too Much About the Wrong Kinds of Relationships.""""Our species is uniquely and remarkably attuned to our social position because many years ago we relied on each other for safety,"" he said.""Research now reveals that social rejection activates the same regions of the brain that are known to respond to physical pain, and also expresses dormant DNA to prepare our bodies for imminent injury. Unfortunately, this response is no longer necessary, so the expression of these genes leaves us more vulnerable to viral infections and more likely to suffer from inflammation-related illnesses,"" Prinstein said. He added that it was also possible that those higher in peer status are more likely to be afforded opportunities for learning and access to more resources -- including ones that could promote their health. ""We spend so much time, energy, and funding attending to factors we think can improve children's chances at a happy and successful life, but we have neglected the one factor that is perhaps most important of all: our children's ability to get along well with others and be perceived as likeable,"" he said.For parents worried about their kids' social life, Almquist stressed that problematic experiences with peers do not automatically lead to health problems and having caring and supportive parents was a ""protective factor.""Ehrlich agreed that strong ties between parents and teens could act as a buffer against problematic peer relationships. ""It is understandable to see these findings and worry about the long-term consequences for teens who might be more socially isolated. ""Additionally, many adolescents struggle at one point or another with their peer relationships -- finding it difficult to fit in or 'find their people,'"" she said. ""The advice I would give to families is: keep trying. Join new clubs, try to meet people online, put yourself out there -- you never know who could turn out to be a lifelong friend.""",0
116," (CNN)At first, Cameron Lynch thought she would need prepared questions for the group to discuss in their first Zoom call. On the list of proposed topics: ""Have you had a hard time with friends in the pandemic?"", ""Are you planning to go back to school in the fall?"" and ""How have you been coping on a day-to-day basis?""But Lynch quickly realized that the group of immunocompromised college students didn't need questions to guide them. They just wanted to talk about their shared feeling of isolation during the pandemic. They bonded over the fact that people assume that all teens are healthy. They questioned whether their schools were taking the right measures to help those who are more at-risk. They vented about their friends not understanding their inability to leave the house without fear of contracting Covid.It's a virtual support group for immunocompromised students -- but its members don't call it that. They prefer the name ""Chronic and Iconic."" It all started with a social media post. Lynch, who has Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and a form of muscular dystrophy, opened up in a heartfelt letter to her friends and followers. ""While I have been preparing my body to fight the virus by running so my lung capacity can be better, eating healthy so that my body has enough nutrients to fight, and attempting to manage my disease (which is difficult with teenage hormones), it seems that everyone else has stopped caring,"" Lynch, 19, wrote in the letter, which she shared with CNN. ""My reality is different. My reality is isolating.""Her reality means she can't hang out with other college students who she said she sees on her social media feed ""flood to the beaches to drink their White Claws."" Instead, it means she sits alone in her bed ""afraid that no one cares.""Much to Lynch's surprise, the post resonated beyond her own social network. What started in July as a five-person Zoom hangout has turned into a 50-plus person group -- with students from across the US -- who have an ongoing GroupMe text messaging chain and frequent video calls.As US colleges and universities return -- either in-person, online only or both in what's called the ""hybrid model"" -- immunocompromised students are struggling to figure out how to navigate school during a pandemic. If their classes aren't offered online, some are forced to rearrange their schedules or risk falling behind. If they don't feel safe going to campus, some have to take a leave of absence. And throughout it all, some say the feeling of isolation has become overwhelming. ""I think one thing that the media and schools don't seem to understand is how these policies are impacting the mental health of their students,"" Lynch told CNN. ""By saying that in-person learning is essential, that's basically saying the community can function without us, and is better off when we're not there.""Covid puts life on hold for high-risk students In her letter, Lynch emphasized that her new normal means limiting time outside, even though she's sick of watching shows on Netflix. Unlike her peers, who can cautiously partake in activities, she feels she has to keep her life on hold until Covid is no longer a threat.And she's not alone. People with underlying medical conditions are more likely to become seriously ill if they get Covid-19. Some of them are young and most of them may not look sick at all. Millions of them are living with a compromised immune system.""People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,"" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes on its website. ""They may also remain infectious for a longer period of time than others with COVID-19.""Aside from worrying about getting infected, many of these immunocompromised students said they feel anxious about people -- specifically their peers -- disobeying health and safety guidelines.To date, there are more than 40,000 cases of Covid-19 among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- and is likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days.With social life trickling back to life on campuses, coronavirus outbreaks have hit places where students congregate, like fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning. While most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities.""With the pandemic, we don't have same sense of immortality as other people,"" Lynch said. ""This is very real for us. If we get a cold, we're in hospital for four days. We have to take it more seriously. If there aren't systems in place we have to make them.""They found comfort in a virtual communitySamantha Price, who has Type 1 diabetes, was among the first to respond to Lynch's letter.Price and Lynch met doing community theater in Richmond, Virginia, when they were 10 and nine years old, respectively. They bonded after realizing they both have diabetes. Over the years, they lost touch. But Price saw Lynch's post and reached out.Together, the two created the support group, which now includes people with a range of disabilities. ""We always say, 'Can you explain what that is please?' when people say what their disability is,"" Lynch said. ""We learn what everyone's going through, and how we can better support each other.""Price, a junior at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said it's been comforting to connect with people who understand how she's been feeling.""We're not normally surrounded by people who can relate to us,"" Price told CNN. ""It (the group) helps us have our feelings validated. If I'm super depressed or down in the dumps one day because my friends are going out and posting about it ... complaining isn't going to do anything,"" the 20-year-old said. ""But if I'm able to go to this group and say, 'this happened' 15 people like it or respond and say, 'I totally understand, that happened to me.'""Kaitlin Ahern, a 20-year-old student at Lafayette College, saw Lynch's social media post circulating online and reached out, eventually joining the group.""At this time it's very easy to feel ostracized and alone,"" said Ahern, who said she is immunocompromised because of a medication she takes. ""Because everyone's kind of paying attention to older people because they are immunocompromised, and younger people kind of expect all young people to be able to reckless and go out and party and everything."" Ahern's college is mostly remote for the semester, but she lives near other schools and sees students everywhere. ""I can't see my friends because they are all partying, they aren't willing to give up partying just to wear a mask and social distance (and) see me,"" she said. ""There's very little contact outside of my family. It's very lonely not interacting with anyone.""The virtual group has been ""amazing,"" especially as she struggled to connect to her existing social circle during the pandemic, she said.It's not surprising that the pandemic has affected the mental health of many nationwide, including young people. The National Center for Health Statistics and the US Census Bureau estimate that more than a third of Americans have experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety since spring.A recent CDC survey found that almost 41% of respondents are struggling with mental health issues stemming from the pandemic -- both related to the pandemic itself and the measures used to contain it, including physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.""A lot of students in the group text us, like 'Today was a terrible day, I'm so frustrated,'"" Lynch said. ""We're kind of like a help line in a sense. We're all at home so people respond very quickly.""Now, the group has gone beyond just sharing their problems.""People will talk about their highlight of the week, what quarantine crafts they've started,"" Price said. ""Some people will tell us about their personal lives. We've actually gotten to know these people really well.""Students ask peers to 'stay safely away'Aleah Colón-Alfonso, who has small fiber neuropathy, Lyme disease and accompanying secondary illnesses, said she felt the need to do something after noticing the lack of social distancing and facial coverings in Sarasota, Florida.Though the junior at the New College of Florida isn't part of the virtual support group, she has found a different way to help people who are in similar situations. In July, she officially launched a business called Stay Safely Away, which sells wearable merchandise that lets people display their immunocompromised status to urge others around them to ""stay safely away.""""Communicating behind masks and from a distance is difficult, so my idea and all my products attempt to serve as an unspoken and polite assertion,"" she told CNN.The company now sells more than 150 products, including beach towels, face masks, backpacks, school supplies, swimwear and stickers. All merchandise includes some sort of catchy yet informative message, like: ""I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised"" and ""science is real.""""'I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised' was a direct quote of what I wanted to say to every person I socially distanced myself from,"" she said. ""The phrase is essentially a shortened version of 'I really don't want to be rude -- but I also really don't want to end up on a ventilator!'"" Big plans beyond fallIn recent interviews with CNN, three developmental psychologists said they believe the majority of students are taking the pandemic seriously and acting accordingly. Viral videos of maskless parties and packed bars account for hundreds out of the nearly 20 million college students in the US, they said.But for at-risk students, the fear is still there -- and some must decide whether they feel safe enough to return to campus. ""The first feeling I had about universities and schools reopening was fear,"" Colón-Alfonso said. ""Fear of lives lost, fear of the academic and social impact, and fear of how to accurately make decisions in a time where everything seems uncertain and ever changing. I also felt a distinct trepidation towards institutions who need student tuition if they want to remain afloat.""Colón-Alfonso said her school has been very ""accommodating,"" and she feels safe returning to in-person learning. However, she added, ""I know that my experience is an exception to the rule. Seeing parties on the news, receiving texts from family and friends in college with stories of the danger they see every day is unsettling.""Many at-risk students remain wary of the risks. Lynch, who is in the UK with her family, and Price, who is in Virginia with her parents, said they have barely left their homes. But the time in quarantine has also given them a renewed sense of purpose -- and the two said they have big plans. Eventually, Lynch said, she and Price want to create a national organization for disabled students, with branches at universities and colleges.""There's college diabetes network which we're both apart of,"" Lynch said, ""but this would be for more disabilities -- physical, learning and invisible disabilities.""The two also hope to create a conference when it's safe to meet in person.""My goal is getting people to even acknowledge that there are young disabled people,"" Lynch said. ""It's really important.""For now, though, they continue to focus on building their community virtually -- and staying healthy while studying remotely.""We have an understanding that things suck right now,"" Price said. ""But (staying home) is what we have to do. It's going to be better for us in long run.""",0
117," (CNN)A mother's depression and anxiety from conception through the first year of the baby's life is associated with negative developmental outcomes through adolescence, according to a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.That could affect a lot of women: About 15% to 23% of women worldwide experience anxiety during pregnancy, while 15% deal with anxiety after childbirth. Depression through pregnancy is estimated to affect 10% of women, and 15% face postpartum depression. The burden is greater for women who are experiencing poverty or are teen parents, according to Postpartum Support International. For the baby, the perinatal stage — which is defined as the time from conception through pregnancy (antenatal), birth and the first year of the baby's life (postnatal) — is ""a time of unprecedented growth and sensitivity,"" the study said. That's when exposures and early life experiences may modify development starting from when he or she is in the womb to that critical first year as a growing child and onward. A mother experiencing depression and anxiety before and after birth was moderately linked with her child's deficits in language and cognitive and motor development in infancy. All of these children were more likely to exhibit behaviors that either internalized negative feelings or targeted them toward others. These kids experienced and reacted with more negative emotions and were temperamentally difficult through adolescence as well. ""In light of the pandemic, these are particularly concerning results,"" said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University, who wasn't involved in the study. ""Since risk factors for perinatal depression include life stress and lack of social support, pregnant and postpartum women may be particularly vulnerable right now.""These data that suggest that this poses risks not just for the mother, but also for her child, not just now but into adolescence, is a stark reminder that the indirect effects of Covid-19 may be long-lasting,"" Jamieson added. Researchers have conducted reviews of studies on the relationship between a woman's mental health during this time and her child's development — but they hadn't previously evaluated the long-term effects of depression and anxiety at different stages of motherhood on a range of developmental functions from infancy through adolescence, the study said. The authors of the current study analyzed the association of perinatal depression and anxiety with social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor and adaptive behavior development in their offspring from infancy up to age 18. They also examined whether the timing of depression and anxiety, type of mental illness and offspring age affected the findings. Mental health before and after birthParticipants included 195,751 otherwise healthy mother-child pairs from 191 studies based in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Norway. These women had either reported their symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or had diagnoses, while later information about their children's development was also self-reported. Depression and anxiety in the perinatal period had small-to-moderate associations with deficits in social-emotional behavior development through adolescence, such as peer problems, a lack of prosocial behaviors and attachment and emotional dysregulation. How maternal mental health might influence a child's growth How a mother's mental health might influence her offspring's development could hinge on what happens to the baby while in the womb and interactions after birth. Anxiety and depression during pregnancy could expose the fetus to increased concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, leading to changes in brain function and reducing the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients, the study said. The neurocognitive changes that prepare mothers to be able to sensitively respond to their infants could also be hampered by experiencing depression and anxiety during pregnancy, the study said. A mentally taxed mother may be less able to quickly, carefully and thoughtfully respond to her baby's cues — potentially reducing the chances of attachment between a mother and her baby.""During the first year of life, infants are unable to sooth themselves when they become upset — they rely on sensitive caregivers to respond when they are distressed,"" said Dr. Alison Stuebe, a professor of maternal and child health at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, who wasn't involved in the study.""With support from these caregivers, infants gradually learn how to cope with fear and frustration,"" Stuebe, also a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the UNC School of Medicine, added.The authors lacked details about individual, family and social factors that could have affected the mothers' mental health and their children's development, said the study's senior author Delyse Hutchinson, an associate professor in the school of psychology at the Centre for Early Social and Emotional Development at Deakin University in Australia. Additional studies are necessary, Jamieson said, but ""the large numbers of studies in this systematic review begin to paint a fairly consistent pattern."" 'When parents struggle, kids struggle'For mothers to recover from birth and transition to their role as parents, and for growing families to thrive, they need support, Stuebe said. ""But in the United States, 23% of mothers are back at work within 10 days postpartum,"" Stuebe added. ""We are (the) only industrialized country without paid parental leave. Women lose pregnancy Medicaid coverage at 60 days after birth, losing access to psychotherapy and medical treatment for depression and anxiety."" If parents lack access to treatment because they're uninsured, can't take time off from work or face some other barrier, Stuebe continued, ""it's likely that their children will be exposed to food and housing insecurity, poorly funded schools, lack of safe spaces to play and other stressors.""When parents struggle, kids struggle."" Maintaining well-being through new chaptersSince families now ""have to balance the urgent need for hands-on help with deciding who can be part of their 'bubble' in the first weeks after birth,"" the pandemic has made building a village more challenging, Stuebe said. Some solutions can be found at New Mom Health, a resource for postpartum women. Expecting and new mothers concerned about their mood should seek help from their physician and/or psychologist early, Hutchinson said. ""Perinatal difficulties are often overlooked,"" Hutchinson said, ""and many women do not seek help because they think it is expected that mothers feel down, tired or worried or because they are concerned about the stigma related to mental health."" Staying connected with supportive family, friends and other mothers is also important, Hutchinson said — as is doing activities that bring you joy and regularly practicing self-care, ""whether it involves going for a walk or other exercise, reading a book, speaking to a friend, relaxation or simply catching up on some sleep."" While these tools alone may not prevent depression and anxiety, they can help mothers navigate challenges. If mothers are concerned that their children have any of the developmental deficits the study highlighted, they should talk with their pediatrician, Hutchinson said. ""If difficulties are recognised and help is sought,"" Hutchinson said via email, ""this risk may be reduced, potentially leading to improved health and wellbeing outcomes for both mother and child.""

118," (CNN)Like many moms, Sofia Axelrod found the lack of sleep really hard after giving birth. But unlike many moms, she refused to accept that the exhaustion was inevitable. ""Sleep deprivation is so detrimental,"" said sleep consultant Axelrod, who is a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York. ""I didn't just want to suck it up and think, yeah my life for now on is going to be permanently damaged.""The mother of two was inspired to dig into the research, looking for evidence-based tactics to get young children and their parents to sleep through the night. The results of her search can be found in her new book, ""How Babies Sleep: The Gentle, Science-Based Method to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night.""Axelrod learned that parents' brains -- mostly moms -- are wired to care for a young child. Nighttime noises, tame or savage, will jolt many of us awake. Even when the baby is capable of self-soothing. Even when we are so, so tired.But if we let our instinct to care for our young children reign supreme, and get no sleep as a result, nobody wins. ""If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy,"" the old saying goes; and sleep-deprived mamas are not happy.""I wanted to be happy, and I need sleep to make me happy,"" Axelrod said. ""So I said, how do I make it happen?""Axelrod spoke to CNN about how to maximize everyone's sleep, from the baby years on. She also had a few thoughts about which pandemic habits might be getting in the way of a good night's sleep, and which ones, surprisingly, are not.This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.CNN: Humans instinctively respond to light and get sleep cues from natural and artificial light. What should parents use for light to signal ""sleepy time"" to their kids?Sofia Axelrod: The light bulb went off in my head, pardon the pun -- it's intended -- when I was working in the lab with fruit flies. When we want to test their sleep without waking them up, we use a red flashlight. Every other type of light wakes them up.I was pregnant, and I realized that the same is true for humans. We are largely insensitive to red light. So I bought a red light bulb (Ed. note: Not all red light bulbs are actual red light, so shop carefully) and started using it during nighttime feeds when my baby was born, and it worked. The baby wouldn't get the signal from the red light that it's time to wake up.CNN: How does light signal to the brain that it's time to sleep or time to wake up? Axelrod: We have these special cells in the back of our eyes that have special light receptors. So whenever you're exposed to light, in the morning or the evening, they signal to your body that it's time to be awake. They reset your body clock. You can use light to help train your body that this is bedtime, and this is morning time.CNN: Can introducing red light and limiting overall light exposure help older kids fall asleep more quickly at night?Axelrod: Yes. We actually have a red light in our living room that we put on an hour before bedtime.Subscribe to CNN's Sleep, But Better Newsletter: Want the best sleep of your life? Sign up for our newsletter series for helpful hints to achieve better sleep.CNN: Can dimming lights in the evening help get us to sleep?Axelrod: Yes, though it's really important to be consistent with timing. We need to work with our inner clock. Also, turn the red light on or dim the lights an hour before bedtime. This is how long it takes for the sleep hormone that is dependent on light to be released.CNN: Though no matter how careful we are with lights, babies will still cry in their cribs. What's your take on sleep training?Axelrod: Honestly, I regret calling it ""sleep training"" in the book because those two words have such a negative connotation. That said, there are longitudinal studies showing that allowing your child to cry a little and learn to self-soothe has no detrimental effects. I recommend a middle ground. Suppress your mom guilt and let them cry for 90 seconds before you go in. The research is crystal clear -- even just 90 seconds will teach them to fall asleep. People don't realize this, but babies are not born knowing how to fall asleep. It's our job to teach them.CNN: What do you think about co-sleeping?Axelrod: This is a very personal decision. But the research has shown that if you are in the same bed as your child, it's much harder to create that short delay between when the baby wakes up and the parent soothes the baby, and the delay is important for learning how to self-soothe. If a parent thinks they need that closeness, then go for it. But the research does show that kids who co-sleep take longer to learn to sleep through the night. CNN: What about naps? Last year my son took a mandtatory nap at his preschool, and then was staying up past 10 p.m. every night. Should we never wake a sleeping child?Axelrod: I had that exact experience at my child's day care. I tried my best to use my credentials to get them to change their policy so naps weren't required, but it didn't work, and I ended up having my nanny go early to pick up my daughter so she wouldn't nap there. It was either that or let her sleep there and have her go to sleep at midnight.Science is very clear on this point: Daytime naps control toddler sleep. Control! Kids only need so much sleep in a day. If your kid isn't going to bed at night, cut that nap. Either make it shorter or cut it altogether.CNN: There seems to be a critical mass of people who believe that it's better for kids to go to sleep early. But some kids are night owls. Are they OK? Axelrod: This is so politicized -- that somehow people who go to bed late and wake up late are still considered lazy. But there is a genetic basis for circadian rhythms. One out of 100 people have a mutation in their clock genes that alter their day length, and as a result they go to sleep later. It's not detrimental, and nothing is wrong as long as they are getting enough overall sleep.CNN: Many families are a bit off their sleep schedules during the pandemic and going to bed later. So they'll be fine? Axelrod: It doesn't matter if you go to bed later. What does matter is day-to-day variation. I don't recommend doing something different over the weekend than during the week or when you are on vacation. Your circadian clock responds to time cues, and it helps regulate everything, from when you go to sleep to when you are ready for lunch. You want to keep this regular.CNN: What about television at night? I've heard that you need to stay far away from all things backlit in the evening. But sometimes 30 minutes of TV helps us settle down.Axelrod: Screens can be fine at night. Just try to dim it as much as possible, and generally try to avoid them an hour before bedtime. Though people do have different sensitivity to light. Some of us might be fine watching them right before bed without any decrease of our melatonin production or impact on our sleep overall.CNN: Any solutions for Covid anxiety-related nightmares or wake-ups in our kids?Axelrod: It's important to remember that our kids are sensitive to what is going on, and they may not know it or even show it. It depends on the age, but overall it's important to shield our kids from our anxieties and the news to some degree so they can sleep.There is a strong correlation between not getting enough sleep and depression, and so the sleep deprivation can end up making them feel even worse if it continues. Parents need to try to provide the comfort their kids need, so the kids' anxieties don't take over and keep everyone from sleeping well.",0
119," (CNN)An influential model is predicting a catastrophic winter with a significant rise in coronavirus deaths.A possible scenario sees 415,090 Covid-19 deaths by January, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington says in its latest forecast. The worst-case scenario is 600,000 deaths by January 1.""When we look ahead into the winter with seasonality kicking in, people becoming clearly less vigilant, you know mask use is down, mobility is up in the nation, you put all those together and we look like we're going to have a very deadly December ahead of us in terms of toll of coronavirus,""  IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper.The IHME model is essentially predicting the number of deaths will double in the next four months. As of Friday, nearly 6.4 million infections have been recorded in the US and more than 192,000 Americans have died,  according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Despite the dire prediction, President Donald Trump says the US has done ""really well"" in fighting the virus, according to a Thursday video on the White House official Facebook page. ""I really do believe we're rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there, but not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump said. Speaking with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not agree with the President's statements.""We're plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day, and the deaths of around 1,000,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He said test positivity is increasing in some regions of the country and people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather.""That's not good for a respiratory-borne virus,"" he said. ""You don't want to start off already with a baseline that's so high.""Fauci's disagreement with that comment is another example of a top scientist and a member of the White House coronavirus task force publicly disputing the President's claims about the virus. ""We're in a very politically-charged atmosphere now and whenever you're trying to get people all together singing from the same tune and doing the same things as a society, unified against this common enemy -- this virus -- it's very difficult to do that when you have such a charged atmosphere that we have right now,"" Fauci told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""And that really is truly unfortunate."" Fauci warned that the country needs to get the levels down lower ""so that when you go into a more precarious situation, like the fall and the winter, you won't have a situation where you really are at a disadvantage right from the very beginning.""US may not return to normal until 2021, Fauci saysThe US might not return to pre-coronavirus life until the end of next year, Fauci said, but he is cautiously optimistic the US will have a vaccine by the end of this year. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual and I think it's going to take several months before we get to the point where we can really feel something that approximates how it was normally before Covid-19,"" he said.There's also the issue of how many doses of the vaccine will be available and how long it takes to distribute the vaccine. ""It's going to take several months to get the country safe and vaccinated,"" Fauci said. Nearly 30 US states are reporting downward trends in Covid-19 cases, but the pandemic will likely worsen again, Fauci said.""We need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it's not going to be easy,"" Fauci said.Experts -- including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director -- have warned the months ahead will be challenging. The US continues to see about 36,000 new cases each day -- which is better than  August but still too high, Fauci said. ""I keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I'd like,"" he said.As the weather gets colder, Americans will move indoors more, where the virus spreads more easily. The coming flu season will complicate diagnoses. The strains on the healthcare system will make for one of the ""most difficult times that we experienced in American public health,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has said. Where we stand nowThe actual number of infections could be far greater. Many may have had Covid-19 without knowing, as the CDC projects about 40% of people who are infected don't show any symptoms.Others could have been sick but never got tested. A new study says the US greatly undercounted Covid-19 cases at the start of the pandemic -- missing 90% of them -- mostly due to a lack in testing. Across the US, 28 states are reporting downward trends -- including Florida and California -- compared to the previous week, and 14 are steady.Experts worry a surge could come weeks after Labor Day celebrations, like cases soared after the Fourth of July. An ensemble forecast from the CDC now projects that between 205,000 and 217,000 people in the US will die by October 3.Medical experts also worry about the upcoming flu season. Fauci told CNN Friday the CDC recommended people getting their flu vaccines by October 31. ""What we're hoping for -- and I hope this happens -- is that a combination of people getting vaccinated against the flu and the fact that the very public health measures that they implement to avoid coronavirus will actually help them avoid influenza,"" Fauci said. Fauci also recommended people ""hunker down"" for the fall and winter, but he says that does not mean shutting down the country again. ""We don't need to shut down, we can do this if we pull together and abide by relatively simple and understandable public health measures,"" Fauci said, adding that the measures include social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding crowds. Non-symptomatic children can transmit virus, data showEven children with mild or no symptoms can transmit Covid-19, according to contact tracing data from three Utah child care facilities released Friday. Researchers said 12 children got Covid-19 in a child care location and transmitted it to at least 12 people outside, including household members. They analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care centers in Salt Lake County from this April to July. They found at least two children who had no symptoms not only had caught the virus but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One 8-month-old child spread the virus to both parents. The researchers say that two of the facility outbreaks began with staff members who had household contacts with the virus.Overall, children accounted for 13 of the 31 confirmed Covid-19 case linked to the facility, and all of the children had mild or no symptoms.Infected college students shouldn't be sent homeColleges across the country have made face masks a requirement hoping to keep Covid-19 cases down. But just weeks into the first semester, campuses from all 50 states have reported infections. The University of Texas at Austin announced this week three confirmed clusters on campus which collectively account for about 100 cases. San Diego State University confirmed almost 400 infections among students, after announcing a halt on in-person instruction.And more than 1,300 Arizona State University students have tested positive since August 1. Colleges and universities should try to isolate infected students instead of sending them home, Fauci has said. ""You send them back to their community, you will in essence be reseeding with individuals who are capable of transmitting infection, many communities throughout the country,"" he said earlier this week. ""So it's much, much better to have the capability to put them in a place where they could comfortably recover.""",0
120," (CNN)When the pandemic hit, couples found themselves worrying about getting sick, losing income, teaching their children at home while working full time (or worrying full time about sending them to school). It hardly makes a perfect recipe for sex. The stress has been too much for one Texas couple in their mid-40s with two children, according to one woman who did not want to be named due to the sensitive nature of the story, given her high-profile job in Austin. ""I stopped exercising because I was too scared of the plague ravaging society,"" she said.""While scared and doing nothing, I threw my back out and couldn't move for two weeks,"" said the woman, who now works her informational technology job from home alongside her husband.Then her husband had a non-Covid health issue that ""doused any embers that may have survived all of our lockdown trauma.""Covid-19 has invaded nearly every aspect of our lives. So, it's no surprise it's infiltrated our bedrooms, too — for better or worse. Many people are reporting challenges in their sex lives and relationships, according to early findings from the ongoing Sex and Relationships in the Time of Covid-19 study undertaken by Indiana University's Kinsey Institute, which researches issues related to gender, sexuality and reproduction.What the sex surveys sayThe results are a mixed bag so far, said Justin Lehmiller, a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and the author of ""Tell Me What You Want,"" a book about the science of sexual desire.""Some people reported their sex lives and romantic lives had improved and were reporting their relationships were better and stronger than ever,"" he said. ""But a larger number (of respondents) reported challenges in their sex lives and relationships.""The study kicked off mid-March, and researchers initially heard back from roughly 2,000 respondents -- 75% of whom were Americans and 25% were from other countries -- between the ages of 18 and 81 in varied relationships. Almost 53% of the participants identified as heterosexual, almost 20% as bisexual and the rest as: queer, pansexual, gay/lesbian or other. About 44% of participants reported a decline in the quality of their sex lives, with 30% reporting a decline in their romantic lives, according to early findings from the longitudinal study, which is in its sixth wave and will continue for several more months.Some 14% said their sex lives had improved, he said, and 23% reported their relationship was in a better place.And summer, Lehmiller said, brought no salvation. When people are going on vacation and have more free time, there's usually more sexual activity. But the most recent wave of data collection from this summer indicated our sex lives have not yet rebounded to the levels of past summers. ""This summer really seems to be the exception to that peak,"" he said. More stress equals less sexDeclining quality of one's sex life often correlates with higher levels of stress, according to Lehmiller. ""We know that stress comes from a lot of different sources, it's complex and multi-factorial,"" he said. ""The more stressed people reported feeling, the less desire for sex.""That's true even when business is good. For Marcus Anwar, 31, working long hours in Toronto running OhMy — the classified advertising website he founded in 2017 — appears to be taking a toll on his sex life with his fiancee. With everything moving online, OhMy's revenue has tripled its revenue since the pandemic began, he said, but that has meant less free time for the couple.""There are days I am working 14 to 16 hours. Having the weekend off is a thing of the past,"" Anwar said.  ""When I'm done working, I try to spend quality time with Tiffany. But unfortunately, there are constant calls and emails that I have to answer, making it very difficult to separate work from personal life.""""Even though we've been together for so many years, it just hasn't felt like it used to, when we both wanted to be having sex,"" said Tiffany, 29, who declined to give her last name for privacy reasons. ""(Back) when there weren't a million things we had to worry about or have to get done."" Talking about sex is difficultDiana Wiley, a Seattle-based certified sex therapist and licensed marriage and family therapist, told CNN that talking about sex can be very hard. ""Some people are so stressed they've just kind of folded up their tents about sex, they don't want to do it,"" said Wiley, whose book, ""Love in the Time of Corona,"" shares tips for reconnecting sexually and emotionally in troubling times. Wiley suggested a few ways for couples to try to get their sex lives back on track in pandemic times, including tips for full-body caressing exercises that begin with nonsexual touch to help release stress.Being more mindful in the bedroom and in general, she said, can also be beneficial.""Take control of your thoughts rather than let your mind send you into a tailspin,"" she said, ""It helps to name what's true right now, in this moment — my family and friends are healthy, for example."" And if you have to put sex on the calendar, do it. ""It's a myth for sex to be any good it needs to be spontaneous,"" she said. Some are having more intimate sexAccording to the Kinsey Institute's early findings, not everyone is folding up their tents, however.For Bob Curley of Rhode Island and his wife, who had recently gone back to grad school, the couple of over 30 years had adapted to her being away from home more often.""Initially, there was a lot of stress around the pandemic that didn't put us in an amorous mood,"" Curley told CNN. ""But once we got used to it, we really started enjoying having the extra time together.""Their communication improved in and out of the bedroom, he said. ""The sex may not have increased significantly in terms of frequency, but the intimacy definitely has,"" said Curley, adding that the couple took the opportunity to ""push some sexual boundaries together in a way we might not otherwise have found the time or energy to do.""The Kinsey study backs him up, with one in five people trying at least one new sexual activity since the pandemic began, said Lehmiller, including things like trying a new sexual position, sexting or sending nude photos and sharing or acting on sexual fantasies. ""This period in time has been a sexual revolution for many people,"" he said, adding that people who are trying new things were three times more likely than those who aren't to report improvements in their sex lives. Single life in pandemic timeFor single people considering new relationships during the pandemic, feelings of isolation are often compounded with health concerns about Covid-19, said Jenni Skyler, a certified sex therapist and director of The Intimacy Institute in Boulder, Colorado.""I see a lot of people taking this as an opportunity to connect online and cultivate emotional intimacy first before jumping to something physical,"" she said. Such was the case for 34-year-old San Diego resident Jackie Bryant, who pens a monthly newsletter about cannabis culture. Until recently, she said she had been perusing dating apps but not meeting anyone in person due to the health concerns of the pandemic. ""I've been much more choosy, talking to a number of people, trying to be open-minded, but not agreeing to see anybody unless it seemed really promising,"" Bryant said. ""There's this very real layer of death and sickness tied to human intimacy now.""  The pandemic made ""me drill down on what I was looking for even more,"" she said. ""Am I going risk my life for some chump? ... not anymore."" During a recent socially distanced second date that ended with an awkward but cute moment when saying goodbye, Bryant said, she and the man navigated their personal safety rules. ""I was like, 'For you I don't have rules,'"" she said. ""From opposite sides of my yard, we walked toward each other and kissed."" ""I've decided I can't put that part of my life on hold. I need sex, I want to be in a relationship and who knows how long this will last,""  Bryant said. ""You learn to navigate that within the confines of Covid.""And how people navigate the pandemic, it seems, may have the power to lead to a sunnier sexual outcome.""The overall emerging picture is that there are more struggles and challenges,"" Lehmiller said. ""But there's a sizable number of people who really seem to be thriving during this situation, too.""",0
121," (CNN)Cakes, cookies, pie. During a global pandemic or even more moderately stressful life circumstances, we often turn to comforting sugary and carb-rich indulgences that may help to calm us down.Now for the bad news. New recommendations that will inform soon-to-be-released US dietary guidelines reveal we should further limit the amount of sugar we consume. This guidance will come at a time when many of us may be looking to indulge our sweet tooth more than ever. No sugarcoating the new recommendationsFirst, some sugar basics: Not all sugars are created equal and need to be limited to the same degree. Natural sugars are present in nutritious foods like fruit and milk in the form of fructose and lactose. These foods deliver important nutrients — such as fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals — that play a role in a healthy diet. Added sugars are another story. They are sugars or sweeteners that are added to foods or beverages during processing or preparation. They contribute calories, without any essential nutrients.The average American gets about 13% of their total calories from added sugars, but new recommendations call for that average to be cut by about half, according to a recently issued report from the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee — a group of experts charged with providing science-based recommendations every five years. The 2020 committee recommended a limit of no more than 6% of calories coming from added sugars, with ranges from 3% at the lowest calorie levels and up to 8% at the highest calorie levels (which vary based on age, gender, activity level and body weight).  The committee also recommended that children younger than age 2 should avoid any foods and beverages with added sugars.How many treats do you get?That 6% limit translates to 30 grams of sugar in a 2,000 calorie daily diet — less sugar than what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. It's a limit that more closely reflects the American Heart Association's current recommendation, which was issued in 2009.  The heart association's recommendation translates to a limit of 6 teaspoons of sugar, or about 25 grams each day for women and children over 2 years of age; and about 9 teaspoons, or about 36 grams for men.                 There are 6 teaspoons or 25 grams of sugar in two and a half chocolate chip cookies, 16 ounces of fruit punch and about 1½ tablespoons of honey. There are 9 teaspoons, or about 36 grams of sugar in 11 ounces of cola, 2 servings of premium vanilla ice cream and about 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of honey.Why do you need to avoid added sugars? They increase the risk for cardiovascular disease in different ways. For one, excess calorie intake contributes to weight gain, thereby increasing risks for insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  High sugar intake is also associated with increased triglyceride levels that often accompany reduced HDL-cholesterol (high-density lipoproteins, better known as the good cholesterol) levels, thereby contributing to metabolic syndrome, also a risk for developing cardiovascular disease, explained Linda Van Horn, chief of the nutrition division at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine's department of preventive medicine.And since most adults need fewer calories with increasing age, their limited total calorie intake should come from nutrient-dense foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and fish, appropriate dairy foods, legumes and nuts, Van Horn said. ""To consume all of those recommended foods encompasses the vast majority of their calorie allowance leaving very few 'discretionary' or empty sugary calories without causing weight gain,"" Van Horn said. But though limiting added sugars to 6% of calories may be ideal from a nutrient-density perspective, that doesn't mean it will be easy to achieve.""While it's great if you can get added sugar intake to no more than 6% of calories, depending on your current diet, the (previous) recommendation of no more than 10% of calories may be a more realistic and achievable goal to aim for first,"" said Denver-based registered dietitian nutritionist Kelli McGrane, who works as a dietitian for Lose It! and TheHealthyToast.com.Again, here's the math: 6% of added sugars on a 2,000 calorie diet is 30 grams of sugar or 120 sugar calories.  Strategies for cutting backFive food categories — sweetened beverages, desserts and sweet snacks, coffee and tea (with their additions), candy and sugars, and breakfast cereals and bars — contribute 70% of the added sugars we consume in the United States, according to the dietary guidelines committee. These foods are often energy-dense with low amounts of key dietary nutrients. Here are some ways to reduce your intake.Train your taste buds to crave less sugar. Cut back gradually and include more protein and fiber-rich foods in your diet, which will help you crave less sugar.  Consume low-sugar or no-sugar-added versions of foods. Opt for whole-grain cereals with less than 6 grams of sugar per serving and unsweetened yogurts, McGrane said.You can sweeten these foods with natural, nutrient-rich sources of sugar like berries or diced fruit. If your kids love a sugary cereal, you can sprinkle it on top of a healthier, whole-grain cereal. Limit or avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks. That includes sodas, energy drinks and fruit punch. If you like sweet carbonated beverages, add a splash of cranberry or orange juice to seltzer or try flavored seltzers. You can also flavor your own waters with fruit slices for natural sweetness or try herbal fruit teas.Cut back on sugar in your coffee and tea. These sugar calories can quickly add up, especially if you drink more than one cup each day. If you are currently adding 2 teaspoons of sugar, cut back to one. This applies to coffee shops, too. ""If you're just starting to wean yourself off sweetened store-bought coffee drinks, ask for fewer pumps of syrup. As each pump contains approximately 5 grams of sugar, depending on the flavor, the sugar savings add up quickly,"" McGrane said.Enjoy fruit for dessert. Try cinnamon baked apples, berries or grilled peaches instead of cookies, cake, ice cream, pastries and other sweet treats. If you need something a bit more indulgent, swap your candy habit for a piece of good-quality dark chocolate. ""It'll still satisfy that sweet craving without as much sugar,"" McGrane said.Look out for stealth sugars. Added sugars are often present in foods that you might not think of as ""sweet,"" like sauces, breads, condiments and salad dressings. ""Pre-packaged sauces — like ketchup, BBQ sauce and tomato sauce — tend to be some of the biggest offenders of hidden added sugars in the diet,"" said Kristi King, senior pediatric dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital and a national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Check nutrition facts labels. This will help you determine how much of your added sugar budget a food or beverage contains. By January 1, 2021, all foods and beverages will be required to list added sugars on food labels. Until then, look for other names for added sugars like: agave, brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, evaporated cane juice, fructose, fruit juice concentrate, fruit nectar, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, maple syrups, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose and turbinado sugar. The higher up these added sugars are on the ingredients list, the greater the amount of added sugar in the product.Cooking helps you reduce added sugarsUse fruits and spices to add flavor at breakfast rather than sugar. ""Rather than having sweetened oatmeal packets, make plain oatmeal and flavor with blueberries and cinnamon. I even like adding a pinch of cardamom for an extra flavor-punch,"" McGrane said.  You can also use sliced fruit instead of sugary jams on your toast and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. ""Sliced strawberries are my favorite, but peach, banana, and apple slices all work well, too,"" McGrane said.Opt for homemade rather than store-bought baked goods. This gives you full control over the amount of sugar in your desserts. In most recipes (except for yeast breads) you can reduce the sugar by a third without causing a noticeable difference in texture, McGrane explained.Make your own granola or protein bars. ""I like making chocolate chip cookie dough bites that are sweetened only with medjool dates, almond extract and mini dark chocolate chips,"" McGrane said.Create your own sauces and salad dressings. As condiments and sauces are often a hidden source of sugar in our diets, you can make your own versions while controlling the amount of sugar you add. Try using salsa as your condiment instead of ketchup. Two tablespoons of standard salsa contains 1 gram of sugar, compared to 6 grams of sugar in 2 tablespoons of ketchup, McGrane explained. If it feels impossible to escape your sugar cravings, start out by trying just one or two of these strategies. As you get the hang of those newly formed habits, slowly incorporate the other tips, one or two at a time. Taking a gradual path will help you curb your sweet tooth and set you up for improved health for the long haul. Isn't that sweet news?",0
122," (CNN)Not sleeping enough or getting a bad night's sleep over and over makes it hard to control your appetite. And that sets you up for all sorts of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes.The link between poor sleep and a greater body mass index (BMI) has been shown in study after study, but researchers typically relied on the memories of the participants to record how well they slept.Sleep apps on fitness trackers, smartphones and watches have changed all that. In a new study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers tracked sleep quality for 120,000 people for up to two years.  The results showed sleep durations and patterns are highly variable between people. Despite that, the study found people with BMIs of 30 or above -- which is considered obese by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- had slightly shorter mean sleep durations and more variable sleep patterns.It didn't take much less sleep to see the effect. People with BMIs over 30 only slept about 15 minutes less than their less weighty counterparts.There were some limitations to the study. Naps were excluded, other health conditions could not be factored in, and people who use wearable tracking devices are typically younger, healthier and from a higher socioeconomic status than those who do not wear trackers.""These are quite pricey devices, and remember, they are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,"" said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, the associate program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California. ""The results would need to be validated by the appropriate FDA-approved devices, and because the study is likely on younger people who are more economically well off, does that really apply to older folks we worry about with poor sleep?"" said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study.However, Dasgupta added, a major plus for the study is that it did monitor people for over two years, and the results corroborated prior research and were ""not surprising.""""While we cannot determine the direction of association from our study result, these findings provide further support to the notion that sleep patterns are associated with weight management and overall health,"" the authors wrote. ""The findings also support the potential value of including both sleep duration and individual sleep patterns when studying sleep-related health outcomes.""Link between sleep and eatingThere is a scientific reason why a lack of sleep is linked to appetite. When you're sleep deprived, research has shown, levels of a hormone called ghrelin spike while another hormone, leptin, takes a nosedive. The result is an increase in hunger.""The 'l' in leptin stands for lose: It suppresses appetite and therefore contributes to weight loss,"" he said. ""The 'g' in ghrelin stands for gain: This fast-acting hormone increases hunger and leads to weight gain,"" Dasgupta said.Another reason we gain weight is due to an ancient body system called the endocannabinoid system. Endocannabinoids bind to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana, which as we know, often triggers the ""munchies.""""When you're sleep deprived, you're not like, 'Oh, you know what, I want some carrots,'"" said behavioral neuroscientist Erin Hanlon, who studies the connection between brain systems and behavior at the University of Chicago, in a prior CNN interview.""You're craving sweets and salty and starchy things,"" she added. ""You want those chips, you want a cookie, you want some candy, you know?""A 2016 study by Hanlon compared the circulating levels of 2-AG, one of the most abundant endocannabinoids, in people who got four nights of normal sleep (more than eight hours) to people who only got 4.5 hours.People who were sleep-deprived reported greater increases in hunger and appetite and had higher afternoon concentrations of 2-AG than those who slept well. The sleep-deprived participants also had a rough time controlling their urges for high-carb, high-calorie snacks.Get better sleepWant more control over your appetite? Depending on your age, you are supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night. Getting less has been linked in studies to high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain, a lack of libido, mood swings, paranoia, depression and a higher risk of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers.So sleep a full seven to 10 hours a night, stick to a regular bedtime and get up the same time very day, even on weekends, experts advise. Adding exercise to your daily routine is a great way to improve your sleep and improve your health. After finishing one 30-minute physical activity, you'll have less anxiety, lower blood pressure, more sensitivity to insulin and you'll sleep better that night.You can also train your brain to get more restful sleep with a few key steps:During the day, try to get good exposure to natural light, as that will help regulate your circadian rhythm.Avoid stimulants (coffee, tea) after 3 p.m. and fatty foods before bedtime.Establish a bedtime routine you can follow each night. Taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, listening to soothing music, meditating or doing light stretches are all good options.Make sure your bed and pillows are comfortable and the room is cool: Between 60 and 67 degrees is best. Don't watch TV or work in your bedroom; you want your brain to think of the room as only for sleep.Eliminate all lights -- even the blue light of cellphones or laptops can be disruptive. Dull sounds, too. Earplugs or white noise machines can be very helpful, but you can create your own with a humidifier or fan.Does that sound hard? Then sign up for our sleep newsletter and take steps toward better sleep.",0
123," (CNN)With talk of the possible availability of a vaccine candidate heating up, you might have heard the term Emergency Use Authorization -- or EUA -- all over the news lately. But what is it exactly, and how does it apply to vaccines?Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests: a medical product that gets special authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration to be used during an emergency. Sometimes it's a product that has already been FDA-approved, but for another condition, and sometimes it's a new product that hasn't yet received the agency's green light.There is a lot of ongoing concern and debate about whether any vaccine candidate should be granted an EUA -- or outright approval -- without first completing Phase 3 clinical trials.The 411 of EUAsAccording to the FDA's website, during public health emergencies, the agency can use Emergency Use Authorizations ""to help make medical products available as quickly as possible by allowing unapproved medical products to reach patients in need when there are no adequate, FDA-approved and available alternatives.""But that's only if ""the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat the identified disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.""So, in essence, what an EUA does is speed up the process of getting potentially helpful  medical products authorized for a specific use to the public during a health emergency, without the rigorous testing and subsequent scrutiny that's usually required to get FDA approval -- which traditionally takes years.When the health emergency is over, ""then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,"" according to the FDA. But the manufacturer can still submit documentation to the agency for regular approval.The EUA hasn't been around that long. The process was included within the Project  Bioshield Act passed by Congress in 2004, which enabled the federal government to prepare and stockpile new ""medical countermeasures"" during a declared public health emergency.And despite issuing many EUAs over the years, only one vaccine has ever received one -- but it was in an unusual and controversial circumstance. In 1997, the Department of Defense began a mandatory anthrax vaccination program. Shortly thereafter, soldiers claimed the vaccine made them sick, so they sued and a judge put a hold on the program in 2003. The Department of Defense asked for an EUA that then overrode the court ruling in 2005, so it could continue vaccinating military personnel -- this time on a voluntary basis.EUAs during this pandemicDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA has granted EUAs many times to a wide range of medical products, such as ventilators; personal protective equipment, including masks; molecular and antigen tests to diagnose Covid-19, and serologic tests to look for antibodies; and even treatments, such as remdesivir  and convalescent plasma.An EUA can be revoked,as in the case of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. These drugs had already been approved to treat and prevent malaria, and showed promise against the novel coronavirus in laboratory studies. Small early trials in Covid-19 patients added to the optimism, and the medication was touted by President Trump. But larger studies found the medications to be ineffective in treating patients with Covid-19. Additionally, one of the side effects could also potentially be dangerous in people who had pre-existing heart conditions. After about two and a half months with EUA, the emergency authorization was revoked.Many experts see granting an EUA to a vaccine against Covid-19 as problematic. For one, vaccines are given to healthy people by choice, unlike medications that are given to gravely ill patients who might die without them. So drugmakers have a higher bar, so to speak, to make sure there are no unexpected side effects that make healthy people sick -- and the only way to find out is in large-scale trials, like those going on right now.The FDA has said it would hold a vaccine to a higher standard. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Thursday that requirements will be stricter than for an emergency use authorization for an experimental drug.""For us, for a vaccine for which there is adequate manufacturing information, if we going to do an emergency use authorization, it is going to really be like an emergency use authorization plus,"" Marks told a seminar hosted by Duke University's Margolis Center for Health Policy. On Friday Marks and Hahn said in a joint blog post they'd be issuing more guidance ""shortly"" about how much higher the bar might be.  They noted it is up to the manufacturer to ask the FDA either for an EUA or full approval, known as a Biologics License Application. With so much at stake, we understand the importance of being as transparent as possible about the work we do, including how we will make decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines,"" Marks and Hahn wrote.The FDA has already said it would want to see an efficacy of at least 50% -- meaning any vaccine, to be considered, would need to reduce the risk of infection or of serious illness by at least 50% over a placebo.In a string of tweets by Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor and the dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, earlier this month, he noted that ""EUAs involve substandard or lesser reviews. How can you justify a substandard or lesser review for something that would be injected in tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of Americans?""Additionally, Hotez pointed out that the mRNA technology being used in two of the vaccines that are the furthest along in Phase 3 trials -- the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine -- is ""a new technology that has never before been licensed. We have no history or experience on such vaccines. Even more reason for a full/comprehensive review.""Hotez also brings up the point that in this highly politicized climate, there is a lack of confidence and trust in the government and federal agencies. ""We've seen how in 2020 the White House has abused the EUA mechanism - remember the EUA for hydroxychloroquine that was revoked? Neither does the White House or Dept. HHS,"" he tweeted.Political subtextThere is also the worry that the President is looking to make a vaccine available for political reasons during the run-up to the November election.President Trump has said several times he thinks a vaccine could be available by Election Day. Without a doubt, the pace of medical innovation has moved faster than ever before, and human vaccine trials began just 67 days after the virus was first identified. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told public health officials to prepare to distribute a potential vaccine as early as end of October. And FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said he'd consider an EUA before Phase 3 trials are complete.Still, several government health officials have told CNN the idea that a vaccine could be available to the general public by November 3 is unlikely. ""There is a big concern about the sort of political expediency and when this [October] date was being picked ... and just picking this date, before the election, sort of stokes those fears that the government isn't being duly diligent to make sure that any vaccine really is not just efficacious, but has few side effects,"" said Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and former director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the CDC.""So, we're all optimistic that there are currently three vaccines in Phase 3 trials -- that maybe one of these vaccines is so excellent that you don't need to vaccinate 30,000 people to find that it's going to work. However, the concern is that if you don't do a full set of these so-called Phase 3 trials, that you will miss rare side effects,"" he said on CNN earlier this month.When a vaccine -- or other medical product -- is given to enough people, rare side effects can turn up. In 1976, the government  launched a  hastily produced  vaccine about seven months after the Ford administration was led to believe a pandemic caused by a new strain of flu was imminent.The pandemic never materialized, but 40 million people got vaccinated under a compulsory program. That vaccine was later linked to a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine. The link was never proved, but the program was stopped.Also, in order to demonstrate efficacy of the vaccine, dozens of people in the placebo group would need to become infected, while very few -- if any -- infections would be seen in the vaccinated group of trial participants. It may take weeks, if not months, to see that difference between the two populations.Lack of trustThe lack of public trust and vaccine hesitancy are real. A CNN poll in August showed 40% of Americans do not want to get a vaccine when it becomes available -- even if it is cheap and easy to get. Such a low uptake of the vaccine could hurt the country's ability to get the virus under control and return to normalcy.If history is any indication, skepticism -- if not outright mistrust -- about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new. In a study published in 2009, months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 influenza and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, researchers explored the public's willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an EUA (not full FDA approval) by surveying a representative sample of more than 1,500 US adults. They found more than 77% of respondents would be moderately, very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine; 63% said they would not take it.But there were also some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an EUA was safe to use. If the vaccine were administered by a public health professional, 55% of respondents say they would take it. If it came with a fact sheet, just over 57% of those surveyed said they would get it. And if it were administered by their own health care provider, that number shot up to 68%. Transparency is key in gaining trust.Those in charge of the country's health agencies -- Alex Azar at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Francis Collins at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the FDA's Dr. Stephen Hahn and the CDC's Dr. Robert Redfield -- have all tried to reassure Americans that politics will not play a role in when a vaccine becomes available.Fauci has said he believes a vaccine will likely come closer to the end of the year, and that he wouldn't be comfortable with making a vaccine widely available unless the scientific evidence backed it up. ""I'm not a regulator. I mean, I just do the science. I'd report the science in an accurate way, and certainly if I saw interference, I would be very disturbed and call it out,"" Fauci told CNN's Jim Acosta on ""The Situation Room.""As for an emergency use authorization, ""I would not be comfortable with a vaccine unless it was shown in a clinical trial clearly to be safe and effective,"" Fauci said during an interview on NBC's ""Today."" Dr. Luciana Borio, the former acting chief scientist at the FDA, agrees that a vaccine must be shown to be safe and effective first and foremost.But if a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, it should not be withheld until all the stringent licensure requirements for FDA approval are met, because some of the requirements cannot be generated quickly.""Safe & effective vaccines can save lives and help contain the pandemic,"" Borio tweeted. ""The EUA is the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for distributing vaccines that have been shown to be safe & effective in phase 3 RCTs (randomized controlled trials) but have not yet met all of the FDA's standards for licensure.""  Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine program, said that ""it would be unethical"" to not move quickly to put out a Covid-19 vaccine if it is proven to work.""If we know a vaccine is 70% or 80% or 90% effective, it would be unethical to hold it back,"" Slaoui said during a CNN interview on Friday.On Tuesday, nine biopharmaceutical companies, including those who are furthest along in their vaccine testing programs, signed an unusual pledge to uphold ""high ethical standards,"" suggesting they won't seek premature government approval for Covid-19 vaccines.They pledged to ""Only submit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA.""In fact, later that same day, AstraZeneca, one of the signatories of the pledge, said it had paused its trials globally because of an unexplained illness in one volunteer in the UK. The drugmaker called the halt ""a routine action.""""In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline,"" AstraZeneca said in a statement sent to CNN.According to the FDA's guidance, any vaccine -- whether under emergency authorization or approved -- needs to either prevent disease or at least decrease severity by at least 50%.Despite all the intrigue, it may be worthwhile to circle back to the original criteria for an EUA -- in particular, the stipulation that it only be granted when ""there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.""While most people understandably don't want to hear it, there is a reasonable alternative, which has worked well  in many places around the world, and that is abiding by basic public health measures: wearing a mask, maintaining physical distance, practicing good hand hygiene and staying away from large, especially indoor crowds -- especially indoors.Following those rules will significantly reduce the likelihood of people getting sick, and slow the transmission of the virus. It will also buy us more time to make sure we get the evidence supporting the vaccine totally nailed down.",0
124," (CNN)While many colleges and universities are offering classes online, that hasn't necessarily stopped students from gathering. And now some college towns are grappling with outbreaks of Covid-19 as the start of the fall semester complicates local responses to the pandemic. ""We are urging students to understand the imperative role that they play in stopping this community spread and, ultimately, saving lives,"" said Mayor Aaron Stephens of East Lansing, Michigan, where Michigan State University students were asked to quarantine after the local health department reported 342 new cases among people affiliated with the university since August 24.The outbreak started as students returned to East Lansing for the fall semester, the health department's statement said. MSU resumed classes on September 2. And while most are online, many students had ""binding off-campuses leases or simply desired to physically return to the university community.""""MSU is committed to doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" MSU Physician David Weismantel said. ""The safety of our entire community is a priority and we all have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus.""Kelly Girtz, the mayor of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia -- home to the University of Georgia -- told CNN Saturday his city has seen a ""dramatic spike"" in cases after maintaining lower case counts and death counts throughout the summer. UGA classes began August 20.""Clearly it's the return to campus of large numbers of students who are not here through the summertime,"" he said.""Certainly young people are going to do the things that young people do, so we need to create the underlying conditions that keep people safe,"" Girtz said, calling for better coordination among state and national leaders. ""So that means very low allowance of gatherings and really as much digital or online learning as possible.""Six students at Miami University in Ohio were cited after holding a house party even though at least one of them tested positive for Covid-19, according to police records. The university declined to comment, citing federal privacy laws, but said students would face disciplinary action if they violate quarantine orders or the city ordinance on mass gatherings.Arkansas reported a record high of 1,107 new cases on Friday, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson said a backlog in testing was to blame. About 13% of the state's cases were attributed to young people in college communities, according to Dr. José Romero, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health -- though he said that was down from previous counts, calling it a ""good indicator."" More than 6.4 million infections have been recorded in the US and 193,482 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Air pollution from wildfires could lead to vulnerabilityDoctors warn that bad air quality stemming from smoke produced by the wildfires ravaging Western states could make people more vulnerable to coronavirus infections.""Multiple studies have shown a correlation between higher levels of pollution in the air and greater spread and severity of Covid-19 cases,"" said Dr. Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, citing several studies conducted in the United States, China and Italy. ""Some studies have also shown that exposure of lung tissue to pollution may increase susceptibility to viral infections.""Smoke from wildfires can irritate the lungs and cause inflammation that can affect the immune system, said Dr. Rekha Murthy, an infectious disease specialist at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. That inflammation can make people more at risk of lung infections. ""Whenever the lining of the lung or the airways become inflamed or damaged, it increases the potential for inhaled viral particles to take hold in the lungs and cause infection,"" Murthy said.There are also concerns that smoke-filled air will drive coronavirus-positive people indoors, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. That, she said, could potentially increase the spread of the virus. ""We know being outdoors versus indoors reduces the rate of transmission ... but now people are being told you have to go indoors because you don't want to breathe in the air that could cause respiratory issues,"" she said. ""But you don't want to be indoors with other individuals and have a higher rate of contracting COVID-19... so, it's really a catch-22.""To prevent the possible spread of coronavirus during the intense fire season, those remaining indoors due to poor air quality should stay away from anyone who is not in their immediate household, Wen said.Early mask wearing would have saved livesAbout 150,000 of the lives lost would have been saved if more Americans wore masks earlier on in the coronavirus pandemic, a health expert says.  ""If the President had said from day one everyone is wearing a mask, we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" said CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University. Reiner pointed to how Germany handled the pandemic. ""They haven't been the best. They haven't been the worst. They've been OK in their pandemic response and they've had about 10,000 deaths,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett.The US has four times the population of Germany. ""So we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" he said. ""So about 150,000 people would be alive.""He reiterated the importance of embracing masks. ""If you want to think about why we still have 40,000 cases a day and 1,000 deaths a day in this country, it's because we're still talking about masks,"" Reiner said. ""It's so basic.""More deaths predicted if people let their guards downAn influential model is predicting a catastrophic winter with a significant rise in coronavirus deaths.A possible scenario sees 415,090 Covid-19 deaths by January, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington says in its latest forecast. The worst-case scenario is 611,000 deaths by January 1.""When we look ahead into the winter with seasonality kicking in, people becoming clearly less vigilant, you know mask use is down, mobility is up in the nation, you put all those together and we look like we're going to have a very deadly December ahead of us in terms of toll of coronavirus,""  IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper.Despite the dire prediction, President Donald Trump says the US has done ""really well"" in fighting the virus. ""I really do believe we're rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there, but not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump said. Speaking with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not agree with the President's statements.""We're plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day, and the deaths of around 1,000,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He said test positivity is increasing in some regions of the country and people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather.""That's not good for a respiratory-borne virus,"" he said. Fauci warned that the country needs to get the levels down lower ""so that when you go into a more precarious situation, like the fall and the winter, you won't have a situation where you really are at a disadvantage right from the very beginning.""",0
125," (CNN)The AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial, halted last week after an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers, will resume, the University of Oxford announced Saturday.The university, which is developing the vaccine with AstraZeneca, did not say when the trial would resume. AstraZeneca said the trial will only resume in the United Kingdom, adding that it's working with health authorities across the world to determine when other trials can resume. Before the pause, the company was testing its vaccine, dubbed the Oxford vaccine, in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa.The university said in a statement that some 18,000 individuals around the world have received study vaccines as part of the trial. ""In large trials such as this, it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety,"" the statement added.US National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told a Senate hearing Wednesday that pausing a trial was a standard precaution that is meant to ensure experimental vaccines don't cause serious reactions among participants.""To have a clinical hold, as has been placed on AstraZeneca, as of yesterday, because of a single serious adverse event, is not at all unprecedented,"" Collins said at a hearing of the Senate Heath, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. The companies promised to wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely.AstraZeneca did not provide any details on the issue that caused the trial to stop. While AstraZeneca didn't specify what the issue was, at the hearing on Wednesday Collins said the AstraZeneca hold was due to a ""spinal cord problem.""On Wednesday, AstraZeneca issued a statement denying news reports that suggested the trial was stopped because of a case of transverse myelitis -- a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord. On the same day, AstraZeneca said it had paused its coronavirus vaccine trial not once but twice because of adverse events. ""We can also confirm that there was a brief trial pause in July while a safety review took place after one volunteer was confirmed to have an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which the independent panel concluded was unrelated to the vaccine,"" a company spokesperson said.The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the US. It has the backing of the US federal government. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTec are the other two groups with Phase 3 trials under way, also with federal government funding.",0
126," (CNN)Primary school students in China experienced more depressive symptoms and made more suicide attempts after schools closed for the pandemic, a new study found.When Covid-19 hit China in January, the Ministry of Education postponed the start of spring semester to late April. That closure separated children from their friends and their broader community network, and seems to have had an impact on their mental well-being.The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, compared reports of mental health problems in November -- before the pandemic started -- to mid-May, two weeks into the new spring semester when schools had re-opened.Researchers from Anhui Medical University got results back from surveys for 1,241 students who were in grades 4 through 8, and in junior high. The kids lived in Chizhou, Anhui Province, an area that did not have a large number of Covid-19 cases.Nearly 25% of the students reported depressive symptoms in May, when only about 19% did in November. Suicide attempts more than doubled -- at 6.4% in May compared to the 3% who made suicide attempts in November. There were no similar increases seen in reports of children who reported feeling an increase anxiety.Researchers hope school leaders will use this research to prepare the necessary mental health services to help children as they return to school following the lockdowns.This study is consistent with others that have found that enforced social isolation can cause mental health challenges for children.Benefits of in-person school outweigh virus risksAs states grappled with how to safely reopen schools earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics led a push for students to be physically present in classrooms rather than continue in remote learning for the sake of their well-being.The group, which represents and guides pediatricians across the country, updated its back-to-school recommendations in June to say evidence shows the academic, mental and physical benefits of in-person learning outweigh the risks from the coronavirus.""The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school,"" the group said on its website.""""The importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020. Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation,"" the group said.What it looked like when schools reopenedThis overhaul of the traditional school day become reality in August, as schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Indiana opened their doors for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic abruptly shuttered classrooms across the United States -- all while the virus remained largely uncontrolled.More students and teachers tested positive for Covid-19, some schools were forced to suddenly change plans, while others opted to delay the start of the school year giving educators more time to prepare for in-person classes.""What we do know is children have a harder time social distancing.

127," (CNN)Vaccine clinical trials are notoriously difficult to conduct.They involve thousands, or even tens of thousands, of participants, and typically go on for years. The chances that one or more of these study volunteers will develop a health issue is quite high.Most of the time, that health problem is not related to the vaccine being investigated, and the trial can continue. But sometimes there is a chance that the issue -- called an ""adverse event"" in medical parlance -- could be related to the vaccine.In that case, the trial is paused so the incident can be investigated.On Wednesday, it came to light that pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had paused its coronavirus vaccine trial not once but twice because of adverse events. The second pause is still in effect while researchers look into one volunteer's ""unexplained illness.""While Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Wednesday implied that pausing a Phase 3 trial was a somewhat common occurrence, vaccine trial experts interviewed by CNN say it is not common.""It's unusual to pause a Phase 3 trial on a safety basis,"" said Dr. Carl Fichtenbaum, an infectious disease expert at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. ""It's uncommon.""One trial, two pausesAstraZeneca announced Tuesday it had paused global trials of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the study participants.Then on Wednesday, a company spokesperson revealed the trial had also paused briefly in July to investigate an illness in another study volunteer, who ""was confirmed to have an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which an independent panel had concluded was unrelated to the vaccine.""AstraZeneca is one of three companies in the US currently in Phase 3 trials for a coronavirus vaccine. Each trial is aiming to enroll 30,000 people; half will get the vaccine and half will get a placebo, which is a shot of saline that does nothing.""With that many people, it's inevitable that someone, at some point, will get sick,"" said Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.Carrie Wolinetz, associate director for science policy at the National Institutes of Health, agrees. ""Adverse events happen in the normal course of very large trials. It's really a matter of determining whether it's a coincidental event or was it really something linked to the trial itself,"" she said.The coronavirus vaccine trials are what's called ""double blind,"" so when someone gets sick, neither the participants nor the doctors know if they received the vaccine or the placebo.The only people who know are members of the trial's Data Safety and Monitoring Board -- an external group of experts that monitors the trial.Each trial has its own protocol, but when an illness arises that causes concern, the DSMB will see if the volunteer received the vaccine or a placebo.If the volunteer received the vaccine, then the questions begin. If it's believed that the illness might possibly be related to the vaccine, the DSMB might recommend that the trial pause while the illness is investigated.After investigating, the DSMB might recommend that the trial continue as before, or it might suggest a change in the trial protocol, or it could recommend that the trial be shut down.On Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, commented on the AstraZeneca trial pause.""It's unfortunate that it happened. Hopefully they'll work it out and be able to proceed along with the remainder of the trial, but you don't know. They need to investigate it further,"" Fauci said.Hitting the pause buttonRedfield said Wednesday that in his research, he at times had to put trials on hold.""I've conducted a number of clinical trials in my days, both at Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center] and University of Maryland, of which I had the trial put on hold because of adverse reactions until we could evaluate whether that adverse reaction was something that was associated with the investigational product, and if so, was it serious enough that we then had to stop the trial,"" Redfield said at an online forum held by Research!America.Redfield did not specify whether he meant vaccine trials, nor did he specify whether he meant Phase 3 trials or trials in earlier phases, which can be more prone to adverse events because the vaccine hasn't been as well tested.CNN reached out to a spokesperson for Redfield for clarification, but they did not provide a comment.Illnesses that necessitate a pause don't occur very often, according to three vaccinologists -- Frenck, Fichtenbaum and Dr. Saad Omer -- who, combined, have worked on more than 100 vaccine trials.""In Phase 3, it's uncommon to have a pause,"" Frenck said. ""I've seen it happen a few times.""He estimates that pauses in Phase 3 trials due to a study subject becoming ill happens ""in under 10% of trials -- probably under 5%.""According to Fichtenbaum, ""Phase 3 trials don't typically pause. I've only seen it handful of times in my experience.""Both Fichtenbaum and Frenck have served on DSMBs. Additionally, Frenck is a researcher in both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer coronavirus vaccine trials, and Fichtenbaum is an investigator in the Moderna coronavirus vaccine trial.Omer is director of the Yale Institute for Global Health and has been the principal investigator in several vaccine trials.""It's not unheard of that a trial has paused. It's a very real possibility,"" he said. ""But I wouldn't call it common.""Confusion about the cause of AstraZeneca's most recent pauseAstraZeneca on Wednesday issued a statement denying news reports that suggested the trial was stopped the second time because of a case of transverse myelitis -- a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord.""Reports claiming to be based on comments made earlier today by our CEO stating that we have confirmed that a participant in our clinical trial suffered from transverse myelitis are incorrect. He stated that there is no final diagnosis and that there will not be one until more tests are carried out,"" a spokesperson for the pharmaceutical giant said in a statement emailed to CNN.""Those tests will be delivered to an independent safety committee that will review the event and establish a final diagnosis,"" the spokesperson added.The New York Times had quoted a source saying a trial volunteer had transverse myelitis. And STAT News reported that the company's CEO, Pascal Soriot, told investors in a conference call that the trial was stopped because a woman volunteering in the trial had symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis.While AstraZeneca didn't specify what the issue was, at a Congressional hearing Wednesday, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said the AstraZeneca hold was due to a ""spinal cord problem.""""With an abundance of caution, at a time like this, you put a clinical hold. You investigate carefully to see if anybody else who received that vaccine or any of the other vaccines might have had a similar finding of a spinal cord problem,"" Collins explained.He added that ""this ought to be reassuring to everybody listening,"" as this shows the ""focus first on safety.""",0
128," (CNN)Growing up with ""Sesame Street"" in the early 1980s, I found pieces of myself in Cookie Monster's sweet tooth, Big Bird's gentleness and in Grover, who was outgoing and always willing to help others, even though he made a lot of hilarious mistakes. There was even a lady named Maria who was Puerto Rican, just like my family. Maria (played by actress Sonia Manzano) looked and sounded like one of my aunts. I wanted to be a flower girl when she married Luis on ""Sesame Street."" And then along came the movies, which sealed my lifelong obsession with Jim Henson's Muppets.Seeing ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" when I was 7 changed my life. Just like the characters, I studied theater in college, moved to the Big Apple to make my dreams come true and even started doing stand-up comedy, just like my hero, Fozzie Bear. Friendship. Perseverance. Hope. The Muppets helped me get through the lean times and sang along with me when I celebrated any small victories. I didn't know that these amazing characters would prepare me to raise my own child during the rough times we'd face over the past few months. A deep dive into the MuppetsIn my 30s, I took my love of all things Muppet-related to academia. In graduate school, I studied the informal learning that happens for young children when exposed to Muppet movies and other media created strictly for entertainment. I found that kids as young as 3 years old were able to recognize and categorize positive and negative characters, behaviors and situations. Young kids also learned language while being entertained by these movies and television programs, especially when watching with a parent or other close adult. The children immediately picked up new words, when placed in context, and learned more complicated words and ideas by asking the adult watching along, ""What does that mean?""There is much more beneath the surface of ""Sesame Street""'s curriculum-based programming, too. My friends on ""the street"" taught me my ABCs and 123s, of course. But I also learned about helping others, community and what to do with all of the big feelings that took over my little body. These lessons carried with me throughout my life and shaped my relationships with others.I was 18 years old when my grandmother, who was the heart of my family, died. I remember my younger cousin, who was about 7 years old, struggling to understand and cope with her passing. The well-meaning adults, lost in their own grief, used flowery language — ""she's resting in peace,"" ""she's passed on,"" ""she's gone."" As tears streamed down his face, my cousin called out for her and wanted to see her again. I tried to help him understand the permanence of the situation. It didn't even occur to me at the time that I was using the same language the grown-ups on ""Sesame Street"" had used to help Big Bird and 6-year-old me understand Mr. Hooper's death. Helping me parent in a pandemicI had no idea how valuable these lessons of kindness, honesty and emotional intelligence would become once I became a parent. Back in March, a week after my son's third birthday party, I picked him up from preschool. We stopped at the local grocery store — where everyone knows him by name — and went home. We didn't realize that would be the last time my kiddo saw anybody beside his parents for six months — and counting. Like so many American families, when we first began our stay-at-home safety measures, we really thought it was only going to be for a couple of weeks. A month, tops. My son is a tiny empath. One time, I told him that his swim class had been canceled because his instructor was sick. Instead of being upset that he had to miss his swim lesson, my son cried with worry over his teacher's mystery ailment. ""Oh no! What's wrong with Mr. D? Will he be OK?"" That's why, when faced with a global pandemic, my husband and I chose not to ring the alarm bells right away. We told our son that it was just time for everyone to stay at home and spend time with their families for a while, like a little vacation. That seemed to satisfy him.As I grew anxious about the situation at hand, I turned to ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" and channeled Dr. Teeth and the lyrics from ""You Can't Take No for an Answer:""""Whatcha gonna do when the dimes get toughAnd the world's treating you unkind?You gotta hang on to your optimistic outlookAnd keep possession of your positive state of mind""Our family took walks, read stories and made beautiful messes, but it wasn't easy. As more time passed, it was becoming harder to juggle entertaining a toddler and keeping up with our work commitments.  There are big germs out thereAs it became clear that we were in this for the long haul, things in our home got a little looser. Rules and structure took a backseat to safety and comfort. And my son started asking more questions. It was time to change the language we were using. When we potty-trained my son, we talked a lot about hand-washing and germs. So I knew I had a familiar place to start the conversation. We talked about the time he got a runny nose at school because his friend had a runny nose, how he had a fever and how we had to go to the doctor. I told him that there are some big germs out there, and if we get together with lots of friends, it might make us all not feel well. I was honest without scaring him with the gravity of Covid-19. He took it in stride and then said, ""OK. You wanna make some animals with my Play-Doh?""Sure, maybe I left out the fact that some of his friends are, in fact, back at school. I'm heartbroken about everything he's missing out on. Every family has difficult choices to make — and there is no one correct answer. I'm not a parenting expert. I'm just a working mom doing the best I can to keep ""sweeping the clouds away"" for my boy. Sometimes, he has a question I can't answer. Instead of making something up — even toddlers can smell baloney a mile away — I'll say ""I don't know. Let's try to figure it out together."" It's what Kermit would do. 'Smarter, stronger, kinder' That's been the mantra sung at the end of every episode of ""Sesame Street"" since 2016, and it's something I try to take to heart every day. Not just as a parent but as a person living on this planet in 2020.Last night, my kid went to bed happy, healthy and safe. To quote his favorite Cookie Monster song, that's ""good enough for me.""",0
129," (CNN)After time off from exercising, it's understandable if you're having a hard time getting motivated. You may even feel a bit bad, but I'm here to say it's important to go easy on yourself. Even if you start ever so slowly, know that returning to a workout routine means you'll soon get those feel-good serotonin and dopamine boosts from exercising. And let's face it, with so much time cooped up at home due to coronavirus lockdown measures, it's been all too easy for many of us to gain a couple of pounds or more. But if you join me, we can all be in this together.  Now let's think about the path to get back on track. While it might seem tempting to try to whip yourself back into shape by jumping into heavy weight training or intense cardio out of the gate, this cold-turkey approach will overstress your system — and you could easily hurt yourself by training too hard, too soon. That's why I'm sharing a seven-part series of weekly articles to safely guide you back into an effective workout regimen that will set you up for long-term success. This first one sets the foundation by guiding you into a positive mindset and getting you moving in the right direction. There will be plenty of time later in the series for intensive workouts, but for now, we're going to ease our way back. So, whether you're reestablishing an exercise routine — or even starting for the first time — read on for an easy three-step process to get you on a consistent path.READ PART II: Master body-weight movements: How to reboot your workout routineReconnect your mind and bodyWhen getting back into an exercise regimen, it's natural to focus on how much better we want to make ourselves look, but let's stop for a moment and think about how physical activity will improve the way we feel. Any negativity we might be feeling about our bodies being ""out of shape"" actually stems more from our minds and bodies being out of sync.Remember, physical activity produces those feel-good chemicals in our brains that reinforce our positive mind-body connection. Developing this mind-body connection gets you in a positive mindset and will help you establish a sense of control and respect for your body, paving a path for your exercise efforts that's sustainable — which, in turn, will lead to achieving your goals. READ PART III: Strength training with free weights: How to reboot your workout routineStep one: Mind your muscle movementWhen trying to restore and strengthen this connection after being sedentary, I recommend practicing this progressive muscle contraction/relaxation daily for a week and then several times per week thereafter. This is best done lying down, but you can do it from almost any position as it relies on muscle contractions with very little to no movement.Begin by focusing your attention in your body, on your breathing. During this exercise, your breath will serve as the link between your mind and muscles.Inhale as you close your eyes tightly and tighten your jaw by clenching your teeth. Exhale as you release the tension, letting your eyes remain gently closed. Inhale fully into your rib cage and hold your breath, creating tension in your chest, upper back and neck. Exhale to release. Inhale and squeeze your hands into fists, trying to make contact and create tension in all the muscles of your arms. Exhale to release. Inhale to contract your glutes and pelvic floor muscles while tightening your abdomen as well. Exhale to release. Inhale to curl your toes and create tension in all the muscles of your legs. Exhale to release.Take five additional, long, deep breaths, while your mind rests in awareness of your body's state of total relaxation. READ PART IV: Get moving faster with cardio: How to reboot your workout routineBreathe into good postureThe safety and efficacy of any exercise program is predicated on executing proper form. If your posture is poor and movement is restricted, it'll be difficult to perform almost any exercise safely. So, it's in your best interest to optimize your breathing before beginning or restarting an exercise program.What does breathing have to do with posture and movement? The short answer is: everything. The shallow, upper-chest-oriented breathing pattern many of us have fallen into reduces the function of our diaphragm, requiring upper-body muscles to compensate as accessory breathing muscles that lift the rib cage during inhalation. This creates painful, movement-limiting, chronic upper-body tension and poor posture. For more on the biomechanics of proper diaphragmatic breathing, check out my article ""Breathe better to move better: Train to breathe like a pro athlete."" READ PART V: Biking your way to better health: How to reboot your workout routineStep two: Move your ribs while breathingRegularly practicing breathing better will decrease tension to restore mobility and establish good posture  for proper exercise form. Here's a basic way to practice every day:Sit comfortably in a chair with your hands resting on your legs. Close your eyes. Begin lengthening and deepening your inhalations and exhalations. As you breathe, concentrate on the movement of your rib cage. Inhale, filling the lowest lobes of your lungs so that your lower ribs externally rotate and expand out to the sides. When you exhale, completely empty your lungs, using core muscles, almost like an abdominal crunch, to move your lower ribs in, back, and down toward your waist.Repeat this for five to 10 breaths, practicing several times per day.If you're having trouble getting your ribs to move, place your hands on your lower ribs while you breathe, so that you can guide them in and out under your fingers. You can also try the breathing bridge exercise featured in my recent article on exercises to offset too much sitting.READ PART VI: Safely ramp up exercise intensity: How to reboot your workout routineWalk your way to a healthy routineWhen establishing an exercise routine, consistency is the key to long-term success. Ideally, exercising regularly needs to become a lifestyle habit akin to toothbrushing. Rather than diving head-first into an overwhelming workout that's too time-consuming and strenuous to sustain, begin by forging an easy-to-accomplish daily walking habit.Because walking is so accessible, people often discount its benefits, making it one of the most underrated fat-burning, mind-body exercises.Step three: Establish a walking habit Start by walking just five to 10 minutes daily over the first few days while you figure out the best time and place for your walks. Once you've determined the logistics, begin adding a few minutes more to each walk. Ideally, you want to get up to about 20 to 30 minutes per day.On days you can walk longer, that's great, but don't put pressure on yourself to do more, which could sabotage your daily habit. Likewise, on days you can only walk a few minutes — still do it. Of course, if you walk outside, the weather won't always cooperate. On those days, a few sets of walking lunges inside or marching in place might be your only alternative (if you don't have access to a treadmill). The important thing is that you do something active during the time you would've normally walked. Don't break your habit!Keep in mind that walking at a moderate-to-brisk pace can be very effective for fat burning. This is especially true when in a fasted state (not having eaten in a few hours). When your stomach is empty and insulin levels are low, your body relies on fat as its primary energy source.READ PART VII: Why recovery is the key to effective exercise: How to reboot your workout routine In terms of mind-body benefits, when you take your walks disconnected from your devices, it gives your mind a much-needed tech break, enabling you to tune into the sensations in your body. Even better, walk outside to gain the health benefits of green space and vitamin D.Here are some additional ways to increase the health benefits of your walks.Once you've established a daily walking habit, it creates a platform for sustainably expanding your exercise program.This is especially true when in a fasted state (not having eaten in a few hours).

But to ensure long-term success, it's important to map out a logistical plan of where and when you'll be training to avoid unexpected hiccups that can quickly snowball into excuses not to work out.When? Not having enough time is probably the most common excuse for skipping exercise. Don't let that be your excuse! If you can't find a dedicated 30- to 45-minute time slot at least three times per week, trade out your daily walking time on those days.Where? Will you be returning to your old gym? If so, are you comfortable with the safety precautions they have in place to fight coronavirus? Is there potential for gym capacity limitations to impact your ability to work out during the time frame you've allocated?If you're planning to work out at home, it's important to create a dedicated home workout space, so you don't run into issues like clutter or other family members needing the space.Remember these three stepsDevelop a strategy that helps you anticipate and deal with potential issues before they arise. And leverage the three-step process in this article to set your foundation:1. Use the progressive muscle contraction/relaxation exercise to strengthen your mind-body connection.2. Practice breathing with rib movement to create good posture.3. Walk every day to establish a daily exercise habit. Using the three steps above, you'll not only build a foundation for returning to regular exercise but forge a commitment to a healthier lifestyle that's built to last.

130," (CNN)Wildfires have broken out across the United States on an unprecedented scale, with 77 large complexes of fires engulfing 3 million acres in a matter of weeks.While the fires themselves only cover a small portion of California, Oregon and Washington, at least 24 people have died as of September 11. And the smoke they are producing is creating a widespread health problem.Satellite images show smoke covering much of the Pacific coastline, with major cities there seeing very high Air Quality Index numbers, indicating unhealthy air. That's a problem for the elderly and young children, as well as those with asthma and Covid-19 or other breathing conditions.""The weather and geography in the Bay Area and valleys of California can also trap the smoke close to the surface, which can keep the smoke trapped near the ground at certain times of the day in certain locations where people live and breathe,"" said CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller.Here's some advice for reducing your exposure risk and keeping yourself and your family safe.Wildfire smoke includes particles from burning vegetation and building materials mixed with gases. If your eyes feel like they're stinging, smoke exposure could also be inflicting other damage. Particles could be getting into your respiratory system.Exposure can cause chest pain, a fast heartbeat or wheezing or bring on an asthma attack. Besides coughing and trouble breathing, many people experience symptoms similar to a sinus infection, such as headaches, sore throat, a runny nose and even tiredness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Wildfire smoke can be especially harmful to the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with chronic heart and lung diseases. Because children breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults and their airways are still developing, they may experience more severe symptoms.Some people may even experience illnesses like bronchitis due to the fine particles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Those with asthma or lung disease living in wildfire country should consult their doctors.Staying healthy when it's smokyIf you see a haze, smell smoke or know of a wildfire in your area or a place you plan to visit, check the Air Quality Index to see whether you need to limit your time outdoors.When advised to stay inside, keep your windows and doors closed. It's OK to keep the air conditioner running, but the CDC recommends making sure the filter is clean, and close the fresh-air intake to prevent smoke from entering.It's also important to keep indoor air clean by not burning candles, using gas stoves or fireplaces, or smoking. Running a vacuum can also keep particles circulating in the air.Dust masks actually trap large particles and don't protect your lungs from smoke inhalation, but a mask that uses a filtering respirator can offer some protection. The CDC also has tips for how effective different types of masks can be, depending on your exposure.Even if the air outside or in your home looks clear, it may not be free of harmful microscopic particles, especially if the wildfires and smoke persist for weeks.Pediatric pulmonologists at the Breathing Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado also recommended changing your clothes if you've been outside, rinsing out red, irritated eyes and drinking fluids to keep from being dehydrated. Parents should seek emergency care for their children if they experience real difficulty breathing or a change in their level of consciousness.There is a low risk of long-term effects of wildfire smoke exposure for healthy individuals.",0
131," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci said it could be the end of 2021 before life gets back to how it was before Covid-19.""If you're talking about getting back to a degree of normality which resembles where we were prior to Covid, it's going to be well into 2021, maybe even towards the end of 2021,"" Fauci said Friday.A vaccine will help, but there are caveats, Fauci said in a series of interviews Friday.   Fauci has said repeatedly that it's possible at least one of the vaccines being tested could get emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year or early next year. But it won't be available to everyone immediately.""By the time you mobilize the distribution of the vaccinations, and you get the majority, or more, of the population vaccinated and protected, that's likely not going to happen to the mid or end of 2021,"" he  told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell. One stumbling block -- keeping the vaccines cold. Most of the experimental coronavirus vaccines must be kept frozen. Speaking during a Friends of the Global Fight webinar earlier on Friday, Fauci said, ""One of the things that's always an issue is the cold storage issue, and the 'cold chain' that is so often required."" Debunking nonsensePlus, people are not always doing what they should do to control the spread of the virus, even now, Fauci said.""When you're dealing with a situation that requires behavioral change, we in the United States have a significant issue that I'm very disappointed in,"" Fauci said during the webinar.""It was stunning to me ... that in some states and cities and counties, you would see television clips of people crowded indoors at bars, which is a superspreading event if you ever saw it.""Young people may think they are not going to get dangerously ill, and get careless, Fauci said.""But what they forget is their societal responsibility to not propagate the outbreak because if they get infected, they're likely going to infect someone else who then might infect someone who really is vulnerable and will have a serious severe consequence."" And people are spreading misinformation, making the virus even harder to fight.""The one thing that bothers me is the amount of things that aren't evidence-based, and we've seen examples of that in the United States like claims that certain drugs have a great positive effect when there's no scientific evidence whatsoever that they have a positive effect,"" Fauci said.""And yet it gets ingrained and I and my colleagues have to spend a lot of time trying to debunk that. And you're in the middle of a pandemic and you're trying hard to address all the appropriate issues, it is truly a waste of time to have to debunk nonsense.""Fauci also cautioned that just because coronaviruses are in the spotlight, people should not forget  the flu.""The one thing I've learned throughout the years is don't put anything past the flu -- don't take anything for granted,"" he said during the MSNBC interview. There ""a hint of potential good news"" when it comes to flu season. In Australia, where the flu season just ended, ""They have had the lightest flu season in memory -- which most people think is because they're doing things to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection with masks, distancing, avoiding crowds, outdoor more than indoor. That what they've done as a secondary offshoot of that is they brought down the level of influenza cases, very, very low,"" he said. He added that if  Americans can do this, he's optimistic the country will have a light flu season too. ",0
132," (CNN)Whether you're a tiger king or the queen of breakup ballads -- hey, Adele -- please enjoy this week's TV OT: 'Keeping Up With the Oppenheim Group'I sometimes feel like a detective of things that don't matter. Want to solve a murder? Call someone with real skills. Have a petty point you want to make using evidence you find on the internet? Come sit by me. For example, at some point during the summer, I noticed several cast members from ""Selling Sunset"" posted a series of photos from a yacht party but one cast member -- token villain Christine Quinn -- was not in any of the pictures. I immediately texted a fellow ""Selling Sunset"" watcher to ponder the absence, ""Was she a no-show or not invited?"" I asked. We then launched into some detective work that helped us form theories which, having already binged the upcoming fourth season, which has been provided to press ahead of the new seasons's Nov. 24 premiere, I now know turned out to be true. That's when it dawned on me: With ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" off the air, the only family worthy of keeping up with these days is The Oppenheim Group. Attempts to find conventional families worthy of the Kardashian Reality crown have been thus far uninspiring. (Sorry, D'Amelios.) But four seasons into its run, ""Selling Sunset"" has proved itself worthy of filling the void for a new First Family of Fly-on-the-Wall reality. The show, about a herd of gazelle-like female realtors and their two males bosses, not only fills the void of the Kardashians but is a sort of reality TV transformer —at times it's ""The Hills"" and others it's ""Million Dollar Listing."" The storylines go beyond tiny quibbles that are solved in an episode and end with ""In the end, we're family,"" the formula that made ""KUWTK"" a snooze at times. Instead, we're invited into storylines that combine high-stakes real estate, plenty of petty trash talk and build up to big, soapy confrontations. The upcoming season is in some ways the best and worst season so far. The main storyline — which finds the office splintered by the addition of some new faces — is strong, but it also feels like producers struggled to fill the rest of the season with minimal material. (How many times did editors have to include comments about Christine's post-baby body?)Even with its weaknesses in the upcoming season, If ""Selling Sunset"" aired daily for an hour, I'd watch every day. And I wouldn't be alone. I guess you could say that whatever ""Selling Sunset"" has been selling, I'm sold. A not-so-bitter 'Pill' to swallowElsewhere, Brian Lowry watched the new HBO documentary about Alanis Morissette, and still can't quite figure out why she slammed it.""'Jagged' is a perfectly fine HBO documentary about Alanis Morissette's meteoric musical career, made puzzling by the controversy unleashed by her negative reaction to the film when it screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's a reminder that people tend to take the way they're depicted seriously, and -- isn't it ironic? -- often see the bad more than the good.Specifically, Morissette objected to a portion of the documentary and its 'salacious agenda' that discussed the way men hit on her when she was just 15 years old, and regrets that she harbors about that period in her life.'You're not consenting at 15,"" she says during the interviews, adding of the questions regarding why women don't report sexual assaults right away, 'Women don't wait. A culture doesn't listen.'All told, those exchanges amount to about two minutes out of an otherwise wildly positive 97-minute documentary directed by Alison Klayman, which speculates about who inspired the song 'You Oughta Know,' the way Morissette was pressured about her weight and accused of being angry, and how her music opened doors for the female artists that followed her.To a third-party observer with no dog in the fight, Morissette's irritation seems misplaced, especially because she admits to having undergone 'copious amounts of therapy' to address her past, and how living under such public scrutiny is 'not a normal social construct.'Anyway, 'Jagged' kicks off a run of HBO music documentaries, to be followed by films about Earl 'DMX' Simmons, Kenny G, producer Robert Stigwood, and Juice WRLD under the ""Music Box"" banner.

Yet as key facets of the prosecution's case crumbled, one team member interviewed anonymously says that at a certain point, ""Everybody just gave up on justice.""'The Line' captures the gung-ho mentality of these elite units, with member Dylan Dille likening serving in Mosul to 'going to the Super Bowl.'Whether that sports metaphor holds, 'The Line' makes a compelling argument that military standards didn't represent the only line that might have been crossed in the course of the Gallagher case.""""The Line"" premieres Nov. 19 on Apple TV+.Free ideasCongratulations, Adele.

""She was so progressive.""Phoebe Fox, who plays lady in waiting Marial, said ""The Great"" is as much fun to perform in as it is to watch.""Most of the time it becomes about trying to mitigate how much fun you are having,"" she said.

The film is the third film in the franchise, which was originally created by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.

137," (CNN)Stage parents seldom fare well in movies and TV, but ""King Richard"" bucks that trend, placing Will Smith on center court in an overwhelmingly flattering portrait of tennis patriarch Richard Williams. Smith aces the performance, which is the main attribute in elevating the story above the standard sports-movie conventions.The film actually follows a fairly concentrated stretch in the formative years of Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams (Demi Singleton) under the watchful eye and tutelage of their father Richard, who speaks frequently of the 78-page plan he mapped out for conquering the nearly all-White tennis world before they were old enough to hold a racquet.""I'm in the champion-raising business,"" Williams announces as he makes the rounds looking for a coach, met with dismissive and vaguely racist replies, including ""You ever think about basketball?""Williams can be imperious (hence the title) and overbearing, much to the occasional chagrin of his daughters and wife (Aunjanue Ellis), who is no wallflower when it comes to the coaching chores or speaking her mind.The portrait that emerges from director Reinaldo Marcus Green and writer Zach Baylin consistently paints him as a heroic figure, protecting his daughters from dangers in the community, stressing their education as well as their ground strokes and working tirelessly to advance their careers, perusing tennis magazines while holding down a job as a night watchman.Any excesses, such as having the girls practice in a pouring rain, are filtered through that prism. And obviously, Williams' determination to ""stick to the plan"" paid off handsomely, despite the irritation and exasperation of tennis coaches (the most prominent played by Tony Goldwyn and Jon Bernthal) riled by his refusal to follow the customary script, including his decision to pull Venus out of juniors tournaments.Smith not only captures the cadence of Williams' voice but the unwavering confidence that he embodied, absolutely convinced that he knew what was best for his girls. It's down the movie's final stretch, as those plans begin to bear fruit, that ""King Richard"" feels more and more conventional, from the stirring music to the questions of how and when to cash in on Venus' prowess while the younger Serena is left behind, but as we all know, not for long.Smith (who also produced the film) is receiving a vigorous push for awards consideration, and he certainly nails the role in a way that belongs in that conversation, even if the movie as a whole seems unlikely to join him.Perhaps foremost, ""King Richard"" is framed as a response to the criticism and second-guessing that the outspoken Williams faced as his daughters took the tennis world by storm, which might explain why both signed on as executive producers.Indeed, it's hard to escape the sense that ""King Richard"" exists in part to let the Williams family set the record straight. And when it comes to giving Williams his due as both a tennis guru and a father, in this case, love means everything.""King Richard"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters and on HBO Max, from Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia.

138," (CNN)In a directorial father-son baton pass from Ivan Reitman to Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air""), ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is undeniably nostalgic and fairly sweet, while who-ya-gonna-calling directly back to the 1984 original. And yet with its focus on teenage heirs to that legacy, the movie simultaneously feels as much like the Disney Channel version of ""Ghostbusters"" as a long-delayed sequel.Happily, the kids are the very talented Mckenna Grace (""Gifted,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale"") and ""Stranger Things'"" Finn Wolfhard, the grandchildren of Egon Spengler (originally played by the late Harold Ramis). Egon has died, leaving a remote farmhouse to his estranged daughter (Carrie Coon), who for financial reasons finds the move timely.Moving into the place, Phoebe (Grace) and Trevor (Wolfhard) discover a lot of strange stuff happening around town -- starting with all those unexplained earthquakes -- and some nifty artifacts among grandpa's possesses. Phoebe possesses scientific acumen far beyond her years, while her brother mostly just crushes on one of his new classmates (Celeste O'Connor).Mom, meanwhile, strikes up a somewhat unexpected relationship with one of the kids' teachers (Paul Rudd, seemingly everywhere at once), adding to an adult component that produces some laughs but frankly rides in the passenger seat for much of the movie. (Coon is a gifted actress, but there's a bit of the ""E.T."" mom syndrome here, where she can't see all the weirdness happening her.)Cleverly, the film (written by Jason Reitman, Dan Aykroyd and Gil Kenan) does set up a dense mythology connecting this flurry of spectral shenanigans back to the 1980s, while playfully incorporating visual touches that recall the ""Ghostbusters"" of the past. There are also funny unrelated gags, such as Rudd's character getting through summer school by simply running wildly inappropriate horror movies.In some respects, ""Afterlife"" represents a rather conspicuous exercise in fan service, after the bizarre temper tantrum thrown by some in response to the female version of the concept that premiered five years ago. While that movie was flawed, the reaction seemed completely out of whack, elevating ""Ghostbusters"" to an overblown level of ""You ruined my childhood!"" exaltation.The elder Reitman serves as a producer on the movie, which -- with Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson promoting the movie -- isn't the only link to its Reagan-era roots. Still, this is one of those films that doesn't so much cross the streams as dip into a deep well of goodwill, hoping to bridge the gap between those who actually saw the original in a theater and kids and grandkids who will hopefully identify with the youthful protagonists.At its best ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" simply delivers a good time, combining the upgraded special effects with comedy and youthful angst, while taking a little too long to get to the good stuff.Broken down into those components, the younger Reitman has dutifully answered the call to carry on his family legacy, without quite conjuring the kind of sparks that would have made ""Afterlife"" completely rise to the occasion.""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.",0

142," (CNN)Streaming services continue to roll out expensive series based on presold concepts, but those big swings can produce big misses, with two prime examples this weekend: ""Cowboy Bebop,"" Netflix's live-action spin on a popular anime show; and ""The Wheel of Time,"" Amazon's poor-man's version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (before its actual one) based on popular fantasy books.Both shows fall flat, for different reasons. ""Cowboy Bebop"" seeks to replicate the style and tone of the violent animated series, a space western that features a trio of bounty hunters (or ""cowboys""). They're played by John Cho (under a tousled mop of hair), Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, hunting a bizarre array of targets, firing off playful banter and weapons in near-equal measure.While much of the action is episodic, the season is connected by a larger plot involving the villainous Vicious (Alex Hassell), from the Cho character's past, and the alluring woman (Elina Satine) that came between them -- a thread that feels so familiar as to become a bit of a snooze.Introduced in Japan in 1998 and in the US via Adult Swim three years later, the series demonstrates once again that it's not easy to approximate the tone of a cartoon in a live-action format, even one that's adult in its content. (Netflix is also streaming the original show to maximize the bangs -- and there are a lot of them -- for its bucks.)All told, the new series is big, loud and lavishly produced, with a music-infused sensibility that works in its favor, or at least should.Yet somehow, the producers have managed to make a show that appears to have provoked skepticism among the original's devotees -- who speak of it with the kind of reverence once reserved for ""Citizen Kane"" -- without effectively inviting newcomers into the party.Whatever the cause, the chemistry feels off. And while the action sequences are stylishly choreographed, ""Cowboy Bebop"" finally bangs out a pretty dull tune. At least ""Bebop"" doesn't aspire to being much more than fun, while ""The Wheel of Time"" -- adapted from Robert Jordan's books -- has a more epic scope that adds to the sense of dramatic inertia.Rosamund Pike provides a degree of star power -- or at least the most recognizable face -- as the mysterious Moiraine, who comes to a small village where she enlists five young men and women on a quest to thwart the return of ""the dark one,"" with one member of the quintet, still unknown, representing the prophesied savior of their world.The dark one's slavering minions, naturally, are in hot pursuit, but the characters simply don't possess enough pop to draw in those who don't come immersed in the mythology, and the special effects are uneven. What emerges thus feels like another fantasy-based soap opera, populated by fantastic creatures and stiff dialogue filled with ominous warnings like ""The dark one is coming for your friends.""Put the blame on ""Game of Thrones,"" which prompted every streamer to take a hard look at fantasy concepts with literary underpinnings to tap into that genre. As noted, Amazon's really big bet is an upcoming series based on ""The Lord of the Rings,"" which only feeds the sense that this represents a once-over-lightly version of it.While there have been successes, the streaming world has also absorbed expensive failures as it tests these waters, with ""Cursed"" and ""Jupiter's Legacy"" among Netflix's recent one-season wonders.On the plus side, it's nice to see streamers taking chances on material that requires such ambition. Nevertheless, there's not much to ""Cowboy Bebop"" that would merit saddling up for an encore, or anything about ""The Wheel of Time"" to provoke enthusiasm about the prospect of it marching on.""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""The Wheel of Time"" premiere Nov. 19 on Netflix and Amazon, respectively.",0

151," (CNN)Many of the stars taking the stage at Thursday's Latin Grammys will be familiar not just to fans of Latin pop but to most consumers of American pop culture.For decades, well-established Latin artists rerecorded their music in English and made other adjustments to cross over into the American mainstream. Now, Latin pop artists like J Balvin and Bad Bunny grace the covers of major magazines and appear on late night talk shows without changing their music -- English-speaking listeners are instead crossing over to them.""You go to Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, and every week almost there's a Latin artist performing in Spanish. And it's perfectly normalized,"" says Leila Cobo, author of  ""Decoding 'Despacito': An Oral History of Latin Music."" ""That just is an example of how popular the music has gotten and the fact that now it's regarded as mainstream pop not just niche music.""As many of these artists prepare to take the stage at the Latin Grammys on Thursday, here's a look back at how Latin pop music -- with influences from reggaeton to cumbia to bachata -- became the cultural force that it is today. Latin artists have been crossing over for decadesPerhaps the first Latin artist to ""cross over"" was Dámaso Pérez Prado in the 1950s, says Cobo.The Cuban band leader, pianist and arranger rose to fame in Mexico for playing mambos and other Latin rhythms and soon became the label RCA Victor's biggest artist in the Latin American market, Cobo writes in her book. After a version of Pérez Prado's ""Que Rico el Mambo"" recorded by American big band leader Sonny Burke became a hit in the US, the label moved Pérez Prado from its international division and began promoting him in the American pop market. ""They discovered this guy whose music was very popular around the world and in the States, and they said, 'Well, why don't we treat him as if he were an American artist instead of treating him as if he were a Latin American artist only for Latin America?"" Cobo says.From there, his popularity exploded, Cobo writes in her book. He launched a US tour, selling out concerts across the country. With songs such as ""Mambo No. 5,"" ""Cherry Pink (And Apple Blossom White)"" and ""Patricia,"" he helped popularize the mambo across North America, reaching Latin and non-Latin audiences alike.Over the decades, there were some similar crossover success stories. Ritchie Valens made the Mexican folk song ""La Bamba"" a hit on the US charts in the late 1950s. Miami Sound Machine, the band fronted by Gloria Estefan, recorded a number of English-language albums in the '80s. Spanish singer Julio Iglesias would go on to record songs with Willie Nelson, Diana Ross and Frank Sinatra, among others. But these examples were anomalies, according to Cobo. ""Coming from Latin America and singing in Spanish was still a little bit strange and not common for the mainstream, even though it was happening everywhere,"" she adds.All that changed in the late '90s with the arrival of the so-called ""Latin Explosion.""The '90s turned the crossover into a movementRicky Martin's performance at the 1999 Grammy Awards marked a breakthrough for Latin music.The Puerto Rican captivated American audiences with a bilingual rendition of ""La Copa de la Vida"" (The Cup of Life), a song that had been the anthem of the World Cup a year earlier. By that time, Martin was already a star in Latin America, performing for years as part of the boy band Menudo before going on to sell out stadiums as a solo artist.Executives at the label Sony Music Entertainment, which signed Martin to its Latin music division in the early '90s, were already looking at ways that they might market Martin to an English-speaking audience, Cobo says.""Here was a guy that was playing stadiums in Latin America,"" Cobo says. ""If you [were a label executive and you] went to a Ricky concert in Argentina and you saw 50,000 people, you wanted to see what you could do with the guy elsewhere."" But before that moment at the Grammys, most Americans had no idea who he was.Soon after his rousing performance, Martin released his first English-language album, which feaured the smash hit single ""Livin' La Vida Loca."" The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, breaking sales records, while the single topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks straight. Martin set in motion a pop culture phenomenon that saw other Latin artists at the time achieve similar success on the US charts. Some were US-born like Jennifer Lopez (whose debut album was recorded in English) and Marc Anthony (who primarily recorded his music in Spanish before his 1999 self-titled solo album was released). Others were international artists like Shakira and Enrique Iglesias. Four out of these five crossover stars were signed to Sony Music, which some credit for engineering the Latin Explosion.""Right in the crux of 1999, 2000, it was a very unusual time where you had five extraordinary artists coming out at the same time, which is not common,"" Cobo says. ""There was a bit of accident, a bit of planning ... All the pieces came together.""While artists like Shakira debuted in Spanish and later recorded English-language albums that led to their stateside success, others like pop star Christina Aguilera -- who released the album ""Mi Reflejo"" after the success of her self-titled debut -- found fame with US audiences before they started making albums in Spanish. (Lopez's Spanish-language debut didn't land until 2007.)Then streaming changed the gameBut the phenomenon was short-lived, as critics later documented. And after a few years, the so-called ""Latin Explosion"" that promised to transform the US pop market -- as well as the US itself -- imploded.""Not only did the boom's stars prove to be mere comets, but the flash and bang of the carefully manufactured pop boom blinded the public to what's really worthwhile in Latin music -- organic, cross-cultural sounds that continue to evolve under the mass media's radar,"" former columnist Agustin Gurza wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2004.After that period, Latin music fell into a slump, according to Cobo.While some Latin pop hits such as Daddy Yankee's ""Gasolina"" broke into the US mainstream, the Latin music industry took a downward turn as music went digital, she says. Piracy was rampant in Latin America, she explains, causing major labels to lose money and invest less in artist development.But as music shifted toward streaming, the industry began to recover. And in 2017, one song would catapult Latin pop to an entirely new level of global success: ""Despacito.""Three months after the song from Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee was released, Fonsi got a call from his record label telling him that Justin Bieber had heard the track at a Colombian nightclub and wanted to record a remix.Days later, the ""Despacito"" remix featuring Justin Bieber was released. The rest is history -- the song rose to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for 16 consecutive weeks, breaking a record at the time. It was the first Spanish language song to top that chart since ""Macarena"" in 1996. It also topped the charts of dozens of other countries, and became the most-watched YouTube video of the decade.""It's not very easy to [top the Billboard Hot 100] when it's a different language,"" Fonsi said in a 2017 interview with CNN. ""That is very special -- that we were able to break that language barrier and just connect with people through music. From a career level, it's very important. But to me, I'm just very proud that Latin music has grown so much and people are just really connecting to it.""We're living in the reverse crossover eraThe success of ""Despacito"" kickstarted a new wave of mainstream success for Latin music -- one that shows no signs of slowing down.Since ""Despacito,"" other predominately Spanish-language tracks have performed well on the charts, too -- from J Balvin's ""Mi Gente"" to Rosalía's ""Malamente"" to the No. 1 hit ""I Like It"" from J Balvin, Cardi B and Bad Bunny.Streaming has made it easier for listeners to discover music scenes such as reggaeton and Latin trap without those artists needing the marketing machine of a major label -- in other words, English-speaking audiences are crossing over into Latin music.""The world is coming together and sort of getting smaller,"" Fonsi told Rolling Stone in 2019. ""Nowadays people are not afraid to change their normal listening habits and listen to different things. It's like, 'Hey, maybe I don't understand every single word that they're saying, but this song makes me feel this and it makes me move and I connect to it.' To be able to sing in both languages, to work with people from around the world and mix styles and cultures? I think that is truly what music should be about.""Despite finding major success outside of Latin America, artists such as J Balvin and Bad Bunny have recorded few songs in English and have indicated that they feel no compulsion to do otherwise. ""Why do I have to change?"" Bad Bunny said during a recent appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah. ""No one has [told] a gringo artist that you have to change. This is who I am. This is my music. This is my culture. If you don't like it, don't listen to me. If you like it, you know.""However, there's still progress to be made, some critics argue. Suzy Exposito of the Los Angeles Times pointed out earlier this year that the 2021 Grammy Award nominations largely shut Latin artists out of the top categories and relegated them to the Latin categories. But there have been some changes. The Recording Academy announced in April that it would be adding a fifth category to the Latin field, meaning the 2022 show will have more awards for Latin music than pop, rock, rap or country.Others, like Cobo, are more hopeful. The landscape, she says, is much more fluid in today's era -- crossover not required. Some Latin artists switch seamlessly between collaborations with other Latin artists and US pop artists and between bilingual songs and exclusively Spanish-language tracks. Others choose to record mostly in Spanish because it feels authentic to them -- knowing that despite their decision, or perhaps because of it, they have legions of fans behind them. ",0
152," (CNN)Netflix didn't make ""Tiger King 2"" available in advance, and zapping through it, it's easier to understand why.Adding relatively little to the story, and jumping all over the place, the project is mostly defined by how self-referential it is, with almost all roads leading back to the impact of the original docuseries, which was, let's face it, 19 months ago. If you're feeling nostalgic for the the early days of the pandemic for some reason or eager to see what Joe Exotic (as well as several lawyers) are up to, the five-episode season of ""Tiger King 2"" is streaming now on Netflix.The docuseries picks up where the first season left off, with Joseph Maldonado-Passage serving a 22-year prison sentence for violating the Endangered Species Act and an attempted murder-for-hire plot against rival big cat sanctuary owner Carole Baskin.Baskin and her current husband, Howard, have said they felt betrayed by their portrayal in the first season of the show and declined to participate in the second. The series revisits the disappearance of Baskin's first husband, Don Lewis, but doesn't shed new light.The rest of the returning cast of colorful characters seem to be enjoying the notoriety ""Tiger King"" has brought them.The timing of ""Tiger King's"" initial release in March of 2020, in hindsight, couldn't have been better. The timing now feels like a bit of a snooze. Assuming that counts as the concept's second life, let's hope nobody's planning on seven more.",0
153," (CNN)Carole Baskin was far from happy with her portrayal in ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,"" but that hasn't soured her from appearing on camera.Her two-part docuseries, ""Carole Baskin's Cage Fight,"" recently launched on Discovery+ and Baskin couldn't be happier about the public getting a different view of her work as an animal activist. In the series, she and her husband Howard Baskin, along with their team investigate the treatment of big cats in captivity.That includes scouring the G.W. Zoo, formerly owned by Joe Exotic (Joseph Maldonado-Passage), for signs of animal abuse and killings.The property was awarded to Baskin and her Big Cat Rescue after Exotic was found guilty and sentenced to more than 20 years for his role in a murder-for-hire plot against Baskin and violating wildlife laws.As far as Baskin is concerned, the only good thing that came out of her participation in ""Tiger King"" was ""one scene where a tiger was giving birth and they were dragging that cub across the rocks with that metal pole to squeeze it through the wire.""""When people saw that, they were appalled,"" she said. ""It was enough that people started talking about the issues."" Those issues include the breeding of big cats for profit and abuse of the animals.She's hoping her new show will educate people and get them to throw support behind The Big Cat Public Safety Act, legislation that would ban private ownership of big cats and forbid zoos from allowing visitors to pet them.Baskin is more focused on that than she is on ""Tiger King 2,"" which debuted on Netflix Wednesday.She declined to participate in the second season and is pursuing legal action against Netflix for using footage of her in promotion of the second season, she claims, without permission.""They had reached out to me, as they had reached out to everyone, trying to get them to sign release forms,"" she said. ""When I saw that I told them to lose my number.""In an email to CNN, a spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment for this story. ",0

155," (CNN)HBO has a storied history with female quartets, from ""Sex and the City"" to ""Girls."" Yet ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" carves out its own niche with a distinct voice and plenty of very funny material, capturing four young women from diverse backgrounds thrown together as roommates while coming of age as first-year college students.Co-created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, the HBO Max show actually has a lot to say, in part by uniting women whose differences in terms of race, class and geography are somewhat eclipsed by sharing the process of discovering themselves and carving out identities apart from their parents.""Mom, I'm not bringing my teddy bear to college with me,"" one complains during the moving-in stage at New England's Essex College, nicely capturing the middle ground between independence and childhood that this period uniquely represents. Cue the slow-motion shots of shirtless guys jogging, the skepticism about a boyfriend who wants to wait until marriage (""Boys are born ready, so something's up"") and issues about grappling with sexual identity.The producers have helped the process by assembling a very good cast, including Pauline Chalamet -- Timothee's sister -- as Kimberley, a wide-eyed arrival from Arizona who forever seems to be saying the wrong thing, and who lacks the connections and financial resources of her roommates. The remaining trio, Bela (Amrit Kaur), Leighton (Reneé Rapp), and (Whitney) Alyah Chanelle Scott, are equally good, with Kaur garnering the biggest laughs as a kid eager to cut loose out now that she's escaped her parents' supervision.While this is hardly new terrain, ""Sex Lives"" manages to be occasionally sweet in addition to funny, such as when a couple of them attend a ""naked party"" and get chided for looking down at others', um, nakedness.""So we're not supposed to look? What is this, a naked party under Taliban rule?"" Bela complains.Later, Whitney -- the daughter of a senator -- grudgingly attends a fraternity party along with the wealthy Leighton, telling the sea of blond girls that she meets, ""I look forward to seeing you all on 'Selling Sunset' one day.""Amid the jokes and uncomfortable situations (including a positively cringeworthy dinner during parents' weekend in a later episode), there's an almost palpable sense of the desperate desire to fit in, as well as how significant the college years are in defining people as they mature.In that sense, ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" is a rather simplistic, marketing-friendly title for a show that's refreshingly about a lot more than that.As it happens, the series will conclude the same day that HBO's ""Sex and the City"" revival hits the streaming service, a nod to the genre's past. If ""Sex Lives"" is in some respects a spiritual heir, it makes a strong case that meeting the next generation has more creative promise than revisiting an earlier one.""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" premieres Nov. 18 on HBO Max.

157," (CNN)Lin-Manuel Miranda is not throwing his shots, and in 2021, the creator of ""Hamilton"" has been getting a whole lot of them.After his earlier work ""In the Heights"" became a critically admired (if little seen) movie, Miranda has made his directing debut with ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!,"" a loving adaptation of ""Rent"" creator Jonathan Larson's coming-of-stage story, and written eight original songs for ""Encanto,"" a Disney animated film featuring a predominantly Latinx cast. That follows another animated movie, Netflix's ""Vivo,"" which he produced in addition to writing the music.Although he is working from a script by Steve Levenson (""Dear Evan Hansen""), Miranda has clearly approached ""Tick, Tick"" as a deeply personal ode to musical theater in general and in particular Larson, who tragically died on the eve of what would become ""Rent's"" record-breaking run at the age of 35.Deftly expanding the source material into a movie, the film is anchored by a sensational performance by Andrew Garfield as Larson, with the title referring to the sense that his bravado about becoming ""the future of musical theater"" is running dry, with timing running out, in his eyes, as he approaches his 30th birthday.Capturing the creative process on film also poses a tricky proposition, but Miranda mostly manages to do just that, while conveying the palpable anxiety that Larson feels about at what point he transitions from being a writer who waits tables to make ends meet to becoming ""a waiter with a hobby.""The echoes of ""Rent"" throughout are also everywhere, reflecting how Larson eventually went from trying to sell an esoteric concept set in the future to writing about subjects very close to home, including struggles to keep the lights on (literally) and the ravages of AIDS at the time.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" is filled with happy surprises, and Garfield receives able support from Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesus and Vanessa Hudgens, as well as Bradley Whitford as legendary composer Stephen Sondheim.If Larson took the right advice when he decided to ""write what you know,"" Miranda, as a director, has taken that advice to heart as well.As for ""Encanto,"" feeling like an outcast is one of the most durable themes in Disney animation, which has become more relevant as those movies have moved in a more progressive direction than ol' Walt's early days. ""Encanto"" reflects a more recent tradition, in a movie about what makes us special, seriously enlivened, again, by Miranda's musical gifts.Miranda did the same for ""Moana,"" and ""Encanto"" possesses many similar charms, with a sizable dollop of ""The Incredibles"" in its focus on a super-powered family. The main departure, and it's an interesting one, is the lack of a traditional villain, an absence that's felt but mostly overcome by the warmth and energy behind the execution, which effectively draws audiences into the story.Set in a magical town in Colombia, Disney's 60th animated feature begins with a nod to a particularly sober real-world phenomenon -- namely, the plight of refugees. But amid their loss comes the magic that has made the Madrigal family flourish, with each possessing a remarkable gift under the watchful eye of matriarch Alma (María Cecilia Botero).Everyone, that is, except Mirabel (""Brooklyn Nine-Nine's"" Stephanie Beatriz), who emerged empty-handed from the gifting ritual, still determined  to be as much a part of the family as her parents and sisters.""Gift or no gift, I am just as special as the rest of my family,"" Mirabel tells the local children, but she seems as doubtful of the truth of that as they are.Still, just as one of Mirabel's cousins comes of age and her sister is about to marry, strange things start happening, with signs that the family's magic is beginning to fade. Mirabel thus becomes the Cassandra warning of danger, something her grandma has no interest in hearing, merely reinforcing Miirabel's sense that it has fallen to her to save everyone.Directed Jared Bush and Byron Howard (""Zootopia"") and co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, ""Encanto"" compensates for the dearth of traditional conflict with a colorful world filled with powers and an abundance of music.""I will never be good enough for you,"" an exasperated Mirabel says at one point.Happily, ""Encanto"" is plenty good enough for families seeking a sprinkle of that Disney animated magic, just as is ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" brings theater into the home.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" premieres Nov. 19 on Netflix. ""Encanto"" premieres in US theaters on Nov. 24. It's rated PG.",0
158," (CNN)""Queens"" is an extremely familiar idea, elevated not quite to the level of royalty by being slickly cast, packaged and produced. Like Peacock's ""Girls5eva,"" the concept hinges on an all-girl group reunited and again pursuing stardom 20 years later, rediscovering the spotlight and its perils after years spent braiding hair and burning breakfast.Those last mundane activities are how we meet Brianna (Eve), once known as Professor Sex, who is now raising five kids. Methodically, the show goes about introducing the rest of the quartet once known as the Nasty Bitches (a name itself rooted in the past), who, as Jill a.k.a. Da Thrill (Naturi Naughton), notes, ""stood on top of the world for a hot minute.""The other members of the group, Naomi/Xplicit Lyrics (Brandy) and Valeria/Butter Pecan (Nadine Velazquez), had a sour falling out, with the former toiling away as a solo act -- ""still chasing the fame that you found 20 years ago,"" as she's told -- and the latter having successfully transitioned into morning TV, where her unbridled ambition is on full display.It's their manager (Taylor Sele) who suggests getting the band back together as part of a televised event, and the lure of a quick payout is enough to erode the resistance on several fronts. But this is a series, after all, so the reunion won't end there, with the challenge of mounting a formal comeback and all the soapy doings that go with it.As noted, the idea of one-time stars nursing old grudges and grasping for another few minutes of fame is hardly a new one (Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" is an ode to one-hit wonders), but the hip-hop backdrop and casting gives ""Queens"" a relatively fresh feel. The disclaimer would be that once you get past the premise, the series becomes another soap set against the backdrop of the music world, a la ""Empire,"" meaning it will only be as good as the situations that the writers can continue to conjure.Produced by ""Scandal"" alum Zahir McGhee (who wrote the pilot) and directed by Tim Story, ""Queens"" appears to be in pretty good hands on that score, even if the content and actually-not-that-explicit lyrics can only be as nasty as ABC's standards will allow. The show also figures to get a boost, in old-fashioned TV scheduling terms, from having ""The Bachelorette"" as its opening act.For now, ""Queens"" has done an admirable job assembling the pieces.

That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of ""fine wines"" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, ""Can I do this? Can I win?""Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.While Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by ""Succession"" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with ""Veep,"" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.""Succession"" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that ""Game of Thrones"" comparison, the battles on ""Succession"" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.""Succession"" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",0
160," (CNN)Pete Buttigieg is such a smooth political operator that even the fly-on-the-wall access to his 2020 presidential run granted the makers of ""Mayor Pete"" only produces so much insight into his historic campaign. Mostly, the documentary premiering on Amazon serves as a social-studies lesson in how campaigns operate, with the most candid moments coming from those other than the candidate.Seeking to become the first mayor to graduate directly to the White House, Buttigieg always appeared to be running for national attention and some intermediate position, given the hurdles that the mayor of South Bend would face winning a statewide race in deep-red Indiana. Yet his long-shot campaign captured the imagination of many and caused brief flickers of hope that he could actually go the distance.Directed by Jesse Moss, ""Mayor Pete"" captures all of that, including Buttigieg's status as gay man and his decision to openly discuss that, as he says, ""without it swallowing who I was and what our campaign was about.""Still, Buttigieg speaks in such perfect sound bites that it's difficult even in these casual moments to penetrate those barriers. As a consequence, some of the most telling insights coming from his husband, Chasten Buttigieg -- who recalls that ""Nobody was out"" when he was in high school -- and campaign communications director Lis Smith, who peppers her dialogue with expletives as she bluntly lectures the candidate for being too clinical in answering questions that call for displays of passion or emotion.For all that, some of the behind-the-curtain glimpses are fascinating, from a friendly exchange with Joe Biden, his current boss, as the two run across each other on the trail to the strategizing with staff, from messaging to debate prep.""It's not even a debate,"" Buttigieg corrects them at one point. ""It's a media opportunity.""The filmmakers also catch the group briefly (and comically) stranded in an elevator, dealing with a crisis involving a police shooting in South Bend and at the moment when Buttigieg accepts that his improbable pursuit of the Oval Office has reached its end. ""That's how you end a presidential campaign,"" he says, with a tilt toward the camera, before opting to endorse Biden.Currently serving as Secretary of Transportation at the ripe old age of 39, Buttigieg clearly has plenty of runway ahead of him in terms of pursuing future political ambitions.Depending on where that leads, ""Mayor Pete"" is perhaps most significant as a snapshot of a very specific moment, and potentially a road map for the journey to come.""Mayor Pete"" premieres Nov. 12 on Amazon.",0
