0,"COLOMBO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka rowed back on its goal to become the first country to fully adopt organic farming on Wednesday by removing the ban on use and importation of chemical fertilisers after months of mass protests by farmers and a surge in food price inflation.
The government had completely banned chemical fertilisers when it unveiled a new agricultural policy in April.
Explaining the U-turn at a weekly Cabinet briefing, Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage said only the private sector would be allowed to resume imports, which would still be expensive as a subsidy for chemical fertilisers would not be reinstated.
""As a country that is sensitive to the people, because farmers have asked us to do this, Cabinet decided to voluntarily rescind the gazette notification banning imports,"" he added.
The ban on all chemical fertiliser, pesticides, weedicides and fungicides was implemented on April 26, prompting thousands of furious farmers to join street protests, demanding the government adopt a hybrid policy, to allow both organic and chemical fertiliser.
The chemical fertiliser ban, combined with bad weather,  contributed to inflation hitting a 47-month high of 8.3% in October as food inflation rose to 11.7% amid falling crop yields.
Sri Lanka has more than 2 million farmers, and up to 70% of its 22 million population is directly or indirectly dependant on agriculture.",0
1,"HONG KONG, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Share markets were jittery in Asia on Wednesday as trading was buffeted by a step-up in U.S. Treasury yields as well as volatile oil prices in the face of price-cooling moves by the United States and other nations.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) slipped 0.05%, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock price index (.N225) fell 1.62% as investors returned from a holiday and caught up with global falls the day before.
European stocks are expected to open flat, with both Euro Stoxx futures  and Britain's FTSE futures  little changed, though concerns about rising COVID-19 cases in the region cast a shadow on the outlook.
""The infections in Europe are getting worse than many have anticipated and some investors would naturally worry that the U.S. could soon follow a similar path,"" said Koichi Fujishiro, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research in Tokyo.
Oil steadied a day after rising 3% to a one-week high, even after the U.S. said it would release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain to try and cool prices after repeated calls for more crude failed to sway OPEC+ producers.  read more 
Brent crude  futures reversed early losses to rise 0.11% to $82.40 a barrel and U.S. crude  futures rose 0.31% to $78.74 a barrel.
""There's a lot going on at the moment,"" said senior Asia economist Carlos Casanova at Swiss private bank UBP.
""Ten-year yields are rising, and the U.S. dollar is strong, which is a little bit disruptive for Asian markets as a lot of the currencies (apart from the Chinese yuan) will depreciate and there will be some outflows on the back of widening real rate differentials.""
However, Chinese asset classes have been holding up relatively well, he said, attributing the strength to the People's Bank of China removing several hawkish references from Friday's quarterly monetary policy support, indicating central bank support later this year or early next, ""which will provide a floor for equities.""
Chinese blue chips (.CSI300) were up 0.3% and are up about 0.7% so far this week, versus a near 1% fall this week in the Asian regional benchmark.
Overnight, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  rose more than 5 basis points (bps) to as high as 1.684% while yields on 30-year Treasury bond  gained 6 bps. Two-year  U.S. Treasury yields slipped having touched their highest level since March 2020 on Monday.
""There's a risk that the Fed may speed up tapering (of its bond-buying stimulus programme) and that in turn means the timetable for tightening may be brought forward, contributing to the stronger dollar,"" said currency strategist Sim Moh Siong at Bank of Singapore.
Investors will be scrutinising the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve policy committee's November meeting to be published later in the day for clues on whether the pace of its tapering could accelerate.
Non-interest bearing gold, which had reacted poorly to the rise in Treasury yields, recovered a little. The spot price  was last at $1,794 up 0.2% but still close to Tuesday's two-week low.
Major currencies are largely trading based on market expectations of central banks' interest rate normalisation schedules.
New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates for the second time in as many months on Wednesday, driven by  inflationary pressures and as an easing of coronavirus restrictions supported economic activity.
However, with markets having been open to the possibility of a larger hike, the New Zealand dollar  weakened 0.6% to $0.6928.
The Turkish lira remained under pressure, falling almost 2% in early trade to 13.057 per dollar  after a historic nosedive on Tuesday as President Tayyip Erdogan defended recent rate cuts and vowed to win his ""economic war of independence"".  read more 
Otherwise, currency markets paused for breath on Wednesday as the dollar largely held onto recent gains against most peers on the back of rising Treasury yields.

4,"FRANKFURT, Nov 24 (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N), the world's largest money manager, has joined electric vehicle charging (EV) venture Ionity in a 700 million euro ($788 million) funding round, providing a much-needed cash injection to speed up construction of high-power loading sites.
The investment, which also includes contributions from existing shareholders, will enable Ionity to more than quadruple the number of high-power 350 kilowatt charging points to 7,000 by 2025, Ionity said on Wednesday.
Ionity did not provide a detailed breakdown of the funding round, in which existing investors Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE), Ford (F.N) and Hyundai (005380.KS) also participated.
Sources said last month that BlackRock alone was close to investing around 500 million euros in Ionity.  read more 
""Ionity really stood apart in terms of the maturity of the business and the sophistication of the existing partnerships,"" David Giordano, Global Head of Renewable Power at BlackRock, told Reuters.
Founded in 2017 to accelerate the installation of charging stations along European motorways, Ionity now operates more than 1,500 charging points in 24 countries.
BlackRock's investment in Ionity makes it the venture's first shareholder from outside the automotive industry, highlighting the growing interest in the EV sector, which not only covers production of cars but also vital infrastructure.
""It's the coupling of the energy and mobility sector in particular that makes it an attractive asset,"" Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch said.
He said that Ionity was likely to seek additional manufacturers for its hardware, which is so far mainly being built by ABB (ABBN.S) and Australia's Tritium, as part of the expansion plan.
Asked whether Ionity would pursue an initial public offering (IPO) or a deal with a special acquisition purpose company (SPAC), in its next growth phase, Hajesch said this was difficult to predict due to the market's dynamic development.
""And that's great. One has many options.""

5,"Nov 24 (Reuters) - A global shortage of nitrogen fertilizer is driving prices to record levels, prompting North America's farmers to delay purchases and raising the risk of a spring scramble to apply the crop nutrient before planting season.
Farmers apply nitrogen to boost yields of corn, canola and wheat, and higher fertilizer costs could translate into higher meat and bread prices.  read more 
World food prices hit a 10-year high in October, according to the United Nations food agency, led by increases in cereal crops like wheat and vegetable oils.  read more 
The Texas Arctic Blast in February and Hurricane Ida in August disrupted U.S. fertilizer production. Then, prices of natural gas, a key input in producing nitrogen, soared in Europe due to high demand and low supplies. Global urea prices this month topped $1,000 per tonne for the first time, according to BMO Capital Markets. Russia and China have curbed exports. 
In the United States, nitrogen fertilizer supplies are adequate for applications before winter, said Daren Coppock, CEO at U.S.-based Agricultural Retailers Association. Applying fertilizer before winter reduces farmers' spring workload.
But with prices so high, some farmers are delaying purchases, risking a scramble for supplies during their busiest time of year, Coppock said.
Global fertilizer sales were worth $53 billion in 2020, and prices are at least 80% higher so far this year, according to Argus Media.
Normally, MKC, a Kansas farm cooperative, sells fertilizer to farmers for payment up front with delivery months down the road, giving growers certainty about a key expense.
With prices soaring, MKC has scaled back its pre-paid sales out of caution.
""You just don't know what the price is going to be. It has put a lot of retailers in a tough spot,"" said Troy Walker, MKC's director of retail fertilizer.
Delaying fertilizer purchases until spring runs the risk of further supply chain congestion as farmers rush to apply fertilizer and plant seed during a tight window.
""There's going to be a lot of people who wait and see,"" Coppock said. ""(But) if everybody's scrambling in the spring to get enough, somebody's corn isn't going to get covered.""
Wisconsin farmer Jim Zimmerman decided to bite the bullet and secure all his fertilizer for spring, this year.
""It's next year's prices I'm worried about,"" Zimmerman said. ""It could get worse.""
Nutrien Ltd (NTR.TO), the largest U.S. farm supplier, has secured less nitrogen fertilizer than usual for spring delivery because manufacturers are making less available, said Jeff Tarsi, the company's senior vice president of retail. Sales to farmers are likely to occur closer to spring than usual, he said.
The one nitrogen product that is running short in North America is urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), said Kreg Ruhl, crop nutrients manager at Illinois-based farm cooperative Growmark. UAN is a liquid form that is convenient for farmers to apply.
The U.S. International Trade Commission is conducting an anti-dumping investigation into UAN from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago, at the request of U.S. producer CF Industries (CF.N).
Importers are reluctant to book shipments into 2022, because they may have to pay retroactive duties if CF wins its case, Ruhl said.
Farmers could reduce their fertilizer needs by planting more soybeans and less corn, but there is little evidence many plan to do so.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast U.S. corn plantings would decline to 92 million acres in 2022, from 93.3 million in 2021. 
Waiting until spring to buy fertilizer could disappoint some farmers, said Matt Conacher, senior fertilizer manager at Federated Cooperatives Limited, a Canadian wholesale seller.
""My advice is, if you can get your fertilizer now, do so.""",0
6,"Nov 24 (Reuters) - The United States uses more gasoline than any other nation in the world, and lately Americans have grown concerned about the swift rise in costs at the pump.
The White House on Tuesday announced plans to release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with other nations in hopes of lowering costs.  read more 
The average retail price of gasoline was most recently at $3.40 for a regular gallon, up from roughly $2.11 at this time a year ago. The swift increase - 61% over 12 months - has alarmed consumers.
A projected 48.3 million people are expected to hit the roads over Thanksgiving, according to the American Automobile Association, nearly 4 million more than last year, though still short of 2019 levels.
HAVE GASOLINE PRICES EVER BEEN THIS HIGH?
Yes. The cost of a gallon of regular gasoline hit $4.11 in July 2008. The current cost is still substantially lower than that, but a rise this swift is rare.
WHAT GOES INTO THE PRICE OF GASOLINE?
There are several factors. Crude oil accounts for more than half of the cost, according to the U.S. Energy Department. That price is largely determined by supply and demand worldwide.
Consumers pay additional costs for blending ethanol and other additives, as well as for distribution and marketing. Those costs have risen significantly, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS).
“Gasoline you get at the pump is really containing eight or nine different elements, all of which have increased in cost in  recent months,” said Kloza.
Roughly 17% of the cost comes from taxes. The federal gasoline tax is 18 cents, while the average taxes and fees per state is 30 cents, though this varies (see GRAPHIC).
HOW DOES RELEASING CRUDE RESERVES AFFECT FUEL PRICES?
The release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be a combination of a loan and a sale to companies, U.S. officials said, for a total of 50 million barrels.
Oil prices have fallen for several days as the oil market expected news of a potential release. However, because it takes time for a strategic release to work its way into the refining process, drivers are not likely to see pump prices fall when they hit the road for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.
“It is unlikely the price relief will be passed down to consumers in the near short-term, unless the Biden administration prioritizes the release of gasoline stocks,” said Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.
WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE TO LOWER PRICES AT THE PUMP?
In response to higher gasoline prices in his state, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis asked lawmakers on Monday to consider waiving the gasoline tax in the state, which is used to fund public transportation infrastructure. Florida's total state taxes and fees are nearly 35 cents, above the national average.
“Other Republican-leaning states may follow suit, especially if they argue the revenues will be made up from funding within the federal infrastructure bill,” Kloza said.
WHERE ARE GASOLINE PRICES HEADED AFTER THIS WEEK?
Gasoline prices are likely to decrease in the coming weeks, but a lot of that is due to lower demand for the fuel in the winter months, according to Kloza.
When demand for gasoline returns, U.S. consumers will likely return to the pumps but the capacity to refine the oil is diminished after a year in which even sizable refineries shuttered across the globe.
President Joe Biden, in his remarks on releasing oil from the strategic reserve, said prices should be about 25 cents lower than they are now. Indeed, the gap between unfinished gasoline futures known as RBOB, and retail prices, is currently $1.14 a gallon, highest since April 2020.",0

U.S. Treasury yields and the greenback reacted to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell being nominated for a second term on Tuesday, reinforcing bets that U.S. interest rates would rise next year.

12,"WELLINGTON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates for the second straight month on Wednesday to keep surging consumer prices in check and warned homeowners in the country's red hot housing market to get ready for more hikes.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) lifted the official cash rate (OCR) a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75% in the final policy meeting of the year, as the country shakes off its pandemic slump and prepares to reopen to the world.
Most economists in a Reuters poll predicted the RBNZ would raise rates by 25 basis points. Investors were more aggressively poised, pricing in a 40% chance of a 50 basis point hike, which meant the local dollar sold off after the smaller move was announced.  read more RBNZWATCH
Indeed, RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said the bank had considered a range of options, including a 50 basis point hike, but added the 25 basis point increase placed its ""best foot forward"".
""At the moment, with everything we have in our hands, we see steady steps of 25 basis points back to levels where the OCR is marginally above the neutral rate as the most balanced approach we can take,"" Orr told reporters after the meeting.
The RBNZ has said in its forecasts on Wednesday that rates would reach 2.5% by 2023 and go higher by December 2024.
""Given the heat in the economy we think the RBNZ is far from done,"" said Ben Udy, economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect the Bank to continue to hike rates to hike next year to around 2.0% by the middle of next year.""
Shortly before the RBNZ meeting, the government announced an easing of some of its tight border restrictions with people allowed to enter the country again from January. read more 
The New Zealand dollar  slipped 0.6% to $0.6905, as investors poised for a larger hike unwound positions. Swaps pricing sharply pulled back, with benchmark two-year swap rates dropping about 20 basis points .
Two-year government bond yields  also fell about 10 basis points, as did 10-year yields .
Central banks globally are now reducing massive monetary stimulus introduced during the pandemic. In Asia-Pacific, South Korea and Singapore have also tightened policy in recent months as inflation pressures build.
South Korea's central bank is expected to raise interest rates again at its meeting on Thursday.  read more 
HOUSING CRISIS
Large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus injected to alleviate pandemic pain have helped New Zealand's economy recover strongly and pushed inflation to its highest and the jobless rate to its lowest in over a decade.
Annual inflation hit 4.9% in the third quarter, the fastest pace in more than a decade while the jobless rate fell to 3.4%, matching its lowest on record from December 2007.
The stimulus also fired up house prices, which have doubled over the past seven years, making them among the least affordable of OECD nations.
That has increased public scrutiny on the RBNZ, which has been blamed for the property market boom.
To cool the market, the government earlier this year slapped taxes on property investors and ordered the central bank to have regard for housing when setting policy. 
But the boom has continued, leaving new homeowners with larger debts as mortgage rates rise.
Orr defended the stimulus, which he said was a response to unprecedented uncertainty following the pandemic, but acknowledged the growth in household debt.
""Homeowners who have just entered the market with extremely high leverage levels have to be incredibly wary and have to understand they have to weather the higher interest rates,"" Orr said.",0
13,"Nov 24 (Reuters) - Aryna Sabalenka has all the weapons to win a Grand Slam but the Belarusian needs to strike a balance between unleashing the power and opting for the safer shot, former world number four Jelena Dokic said.
Sabalenka, 23, has won 10 titles on the WTA Tour and reached consecutive major semi-finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open this year.
She won 45 matches in 2021, picked up two titles at Abu Dhabi and Madrid and rose to a career-high ranking of second.
""I think she's got the quality to do it, I think her game is massive,"" Dokic, who retired from playing in 2014, told the Australian Open website. ""You have to have a weapon to win a Grand Slam, and she's got quite a few of them.
""But I think for her it's about balance. It's about, at times, pulling back from what her natural instinct is, and harnessing those weapons in the right way. Even taking 20% off her groundstrokes, she would still hit massive shots.""
Before this year's Wimbledon Sabalenka had never made it past the fourth round at a Grand Slam, prompting some to raise questions about her temperament.
Dokic said Sabalenka had a tendency to resort to power when under pressure, which contributes to her error count.
That appeared to be the case at the U.S. Open, where she double faulted twice while serving at 4-5 in the last set of her semi-final against Leylah Fernandez.
Sabalenka would later send a forehand long for another unforced error to hand the Canadian victory.
""I'm not saying that she shouldn't be aggressive, but you just don't need to take the unnecessary risk,"" said Australian  Dokic, who made the last four at Wimbledon in 2000.
""If she can learn one thing from this year, that would be it. In those big moments, the worst thing you can do is hit 10 double faults, and hit 20 unforced errors, in a third set.""",0

15,"SHANGHAI, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The yuan was largely flat against the dollar on Wednesday,
though it's value struck a near six-year high on an index of currencies belonging to China's major trading partners.
A burgeoning trade surplus, fueled by strong export growth and year-end seasonal demand has helped the yuan resist the broad dollar strength as exporters have been converting more dollar receipts, traders said.
Prior to market's open, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate  at 6.3903 per dollar, 26 pips firmer than the previous fix of 6.3929.
Wednesday's midpoint largely matched market expectations after it came in persistently weaker than projections over the past week.
The firmer fixing sent the index measuring the yuan' s trade weighted value (.CFSCNYI) to a near six-year high of 102.53, the highest since Dec. 3, 2015, and up 8.11% since the start of the year.
The onshore yuan , however, has only gained 2.14% against the dollar in the same period.
""The authorities seem to have focused more on supporting USD/CNY rather than capping the RMB index,"" Irene Cheung, senior strategist for Asia at ANZ.
Cheung added that recent weaker-than-expected yuan midpoint fixings and occasional state bank dollar buying provided a ceiling for the yuan at 6.36 to 6.37 per dollar level.
In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 6.3890 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.3918 at midday, 5 pips firmer than the previous late session close.
Despite strong corporate demand for the yuan, traders said market participants were debating whether yuan would reverse  course, given the prospects for monetary policy to be tightened in other major economies, including the United States.
""We expect the Chinese yuan to continue to trade well, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve has embarked on monetary policy normalisation,"" said ANZ's Cheung.
But a trader at a Chinese bank said fast growth seen in the export sector since the pandemic was unsustainable, while possible Fed's potential interest rate hikes next year would inevitably draw global capital to dollar denominated assets.
By midday, the broad dollar index  rose to 96.578 from the previous close of 96.517, while the offshore yuan  was trading at 6.3931 per dollar.

16,"JAKARTA, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank plans to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system next year without disrupting lending, but will keep interest rates low until it sees signs of inflation rising, its governor said on Wednesday.
This would reflect a shift in Bank Indonesia's (BI) monetary policy stance to ""pro-stability"" in 2022, from ""pro-growth"" currently, Perry Warjiyo said, adding that the bank's other policies will remain supportive of the economic recovery.
The reduction in excess liquidity would be BI's first move to unwind its ultra-loose policy, aimed at helping Southeast Asia's largest economy navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.
Warjiyo's remarks, made at an annual gathering with financial stakeholders, were in line with his earlier comments on 2022 policy tightening plans, even as BI downgraded its 2021 economic outlook after disappointing third quarter growth.
""Excess liquidity in the banking system, which is currently very large, will be reduced gradually and cautiously so as not to interfere with the ability of banks in lending and purchasing of state securities to finance the state budget,"" he said.
""The policy of low interest rates... will be maintained until there are early indications of rising inflation.""
Annual inflation hit a five-month high of 1.66% in October but has remained below the central bank's 2%-4% target range since mid-2020.
BI has injected more than 860 trillion rupiah ($60.26 billion) of liquidity into the financial system since last year, including through direct purchases of government bonds, and delivered 150 basis points worth of rate cuts to help the economy withstand the pandemic.
Indonesia's economy grew by a slower-than-expected 3.51% in the third quarter as restrictions to fight a deadly COVID-19 wave weighed on activity, but some of those curbs have been relaxed since late August.  read more 
BI cut its 2021 growth forecast to between 3.2% and 4% from 3.5% to 4.3% previously, Warjiyo said.
But it slightly upgraded its outlook for 2022, expecting the economy to expand between 4.7% and 5.5% next year from a previous range of 4.6% to 5.4%, he added.

17,"LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Barbados, a former British colony, will next week ditch Queen Elizabeth as head of state, breaking its last remaining imperial bonds with Britain nearly 400 years since the first English ship arrived at the Caribbean island.
Barbados casts the removal of Elizabeth II, who is queen of Barbados and 15 other realms including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Jamaica, as a sign of confidence and a way to finally break with the demons of its colonial history.
""This is the end of the story of colonial exploitation of the mind and body,"" said Professor Sir Hilary Beckles, a Barbadian historian. He said this was a historic moment for Barbados, the Caribbean and all post-colonial societies.
""The people of this island have struggled, not only for freedom and justice, but to remove themselves from the tyranny of imperial and colonial authority,"" said Beckles, vice-chancellor of The University of the West Indies.
The birth of the republic, 55 years to the day since Barbados declared independence, finally unclasps almost all the colonial bonds that have kept the tiny island in the Lesser Antilles tied to England since an English ship claimed it for King James I in 1625.
It may also be a harbinger of a broader attempt by other former colonies to cut ties to the British monarchy as it braces for the end of Elizabeth's nearly 70-year-old reign and the future accession of Charles, who will attend the republican celebrations in Bridgetown.
Barbados's move is the first time a realm has removed the queen as head of state in nearly 30 years: Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean, proclaimed itself a republic but remained in the Commonwealth, an association of mostly former British colonies which is home to 2.5 billion people.
Buckingham Palace says the issue is a matter for the people of Barbados.
SUGAR AND SLAVES
Originally populated by waves of Saladoid-Barrancoid and Kalinago migrants, Spanish slaver raids forced Amerindians to flee. Barbados was unpopulated when the English first arrived.
The English initially used white British indentured servants to toil on the plantations of tobacco, cotton, indigo and sugar, but Barbados in just a few decades would become England's first truly profitable slave society.
Barbados received 600,000 enslaved Africans between 1627 and 1833, who were put to work in the sugar plantations, earning fortunes for the English owners.
""Barbados under English colonial rules became the laboratory for plantation societies in the Caribbean,"" said Richard Drayton, a professor of imperial and global history at Kings College, London who lived in Barbados as a child.
""It becomes the laboratory for slave society, which is then exported to Jamaica and the Carolinas and Georgia after that.""
More than 10 million Africans were shackled into the Atlantic slave trade by European nations between the 15th and 19th centuries. Those who survived the often brutal voyage, ended up toiling on plantations.
While full freedom was finally granted in 1838, the plantation owners preserved considerable economic and political power might into the 20th Century. The island gained full independence in 1966.
REPUBLICAN SEEDS
Prince Charles, the 73-year-old heir to the British throne, will travel to Barbados for the ceremonies marking the removal of his 95-year-old mother as head of state.
Barbados will remain a republic within the Commonwealth, a grouping of 54 countries across Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific that has always been a priority for Elizabeth, who heads it.
Though its name will remain simply Barbados, its removal of the queen may well sow the seeds of republicanism further across the Caribbean, according to Drayton.
""This will have consequences particularly within the English-speaking Caribbean,"" said Drayton, who pointed to talk of a republic in both Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
""The queen has had an enormous personal relationship to many of these countries and has shown her own commitment to the Commonwealth vision which she inherited from that imperial moment of the 1940s and 1950s, so I do think that in the wake of the queen's passing that some of these questions would become more urgent in places like Canada and Australia.""
The queen has made many visits to Barbados and, according to Buckingham Palace, has had ""a unique relationship with this, the most easterly of the Caribbean islands"".
The republic of Barbados will be declared at a ceremony which begins late in the evening on Monday, Nov. 29 at the National Heroes Square in Bridgetown.
""The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind,"" Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a 2020 speech prepared for Governor General Sandra Mason, who will replace Elizabeth as Barbados' head of state after being elected president.
""This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving.""",0

19,"HANOI, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The Philippines, one of the world's biggest importers of rice, is taking steps to temporarily limit imports of the grain from Vietnam amid a big harvest at home, three rice traders and an agricultural official said on Wednesday.
The traders said that the Philippines' department of agriculture had suspended issuing sanitary and phytosanitary import clearance for rice shipments from Vietnam.
The Philippines is Vietnam's largest rice export market, accounting for 40% of its total rice shipments.
A spokesperson for the Philippines agriculture department confirmed that it was managing the issuance of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Import Clearance (SPSIC) in accordance with demand.
""We import only what we need, and that we have enough supply at the moment, given the bumper wet season harvest,"" the spokesperson said in a response to a query from Reuters.
The Vietnam Food Association, whose members are the country's rice exporters, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vietnam's rice shipments to the Philippines in the first 10 months of this year rose 12.3% from a year earlier to 2.09 million tonnes, according to government customs data.",0
20,"OSLO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - AutoStore (AUTO.OL) faces a tight supply of certain components that will impact earnings margins in the short term, the Norwegian robotics company said on Wednesday after posting a 95% surge in third-quarter revenue to $84.7 million.
The maker of automated warehouse technology, of which SoftBank (9984.T) owns close to a 40% stake, last month became Norway's most valuable new stock market listing in two decades.  read more 
The company maintained its revenue outlook of around $300 million this year, increasing to more than $500 million for 2022 with a medium-term outlook for annual growth of around 40%.
AutoStore currently faces a tight supply of certain parts and materials, however, and although this will not impact growth it is likely to have an effect on its earnings.
""This situation will have some short-term impact on margins,"" AutoStore said.
Building on the momentum of its Oct. 20 initial public offering, AutoStore's shares have since risen 29% to become Norway's fifth-most valuable listed firm and the second-biggest without a strategic government stake.",0
21,"TAPACHULA, Mexico, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Thousands of migrants in southern Mexico have accepted a government offer to quit a U.S.-bound caravan in exchange for Mexican visas, officials said on Tuesday night.
The caravan is one of two large groups of migrants, many from Central America and the Caribbean, that left the southern city of Tapachula in recent weeks to embark on foot on the long journey north toward the U.S. border with families including young children.
The caravan migrants who left Tapachula last week accepted a government proposal to ""begin the process that will allow them to regularize their legal status,"" according to a joint statement from the interior ministry and national migration institute.
By Tuesday, this group had progressed as far as the town of Mapastepec in the southern state of Chiapas, under the guidance of caravan organizer Luis Garcia Villagran from advocacy group Pueblo Sin Fronteras.
Garcia told Reuters that most of the migrants in the caravan had accepted the offer and officials would eventually bus them out of Chiapas, distributing them across 10 states. The government statement, however, listed nine states.
In exchange for the deal, the organizers agreed not to assemble more caravans in future, a Mexican migration official said later, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Caravan organizer Garcia denied that such a deal had been made, and the statement made no mention of it.
Migrants have repeatedly expressed skepticism about receiving documentation regularizing them in Mexico, and organizers say another caravan is already about to depart from Tapachula, a major migrant massing point close to the border with Guatemala.
Earlier, Garcia said the decision to offer transportation and visas to migrants was positive, after Tapachula had turned into a ""prison"" for migrants left stranded while waiting for paperwork that would let them freely transit the country.
The Mexican migration official said an earlier group of migrants from Haiti and Honduras were taken to Guanajuato state about 1,000 km (620 miles) away on Tuesday.",0

23,"Nov 24 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged higher on Wednesday, though strength in the U.S. dollar and bets that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates sooner kept the metal below the key $1,800 mark.
Spot gold  rose 0.2% to $1,792.68 per ounce by 0438 GMT, after slipping 0.9% to its lowest since Nov. 5 on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures  added 0.5% to $1,792.90.
The metal has slumped 4.9% from last week's five-month high on expectations that newly renominated Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could accelerate the pace at which the central bank normalises monetary policy amid surging consumer prices.  read more 
Those bets also helped strengthen the dollar index  which steadied near its highest in 16 months on Wednesday, heaping pressure on bullion as it raises the metal's cost to buyers holding other currencies.
""Although most of last week's fast-money long positions are probably now closed out, gold is unlikely to stage a meaningful recovery above $1,800 unless U.S. 30-year yields unwinds this week's gains,""  Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said.
Halley expects any rally in gold to be capped at $1,810 in the near-term, with the narrative around higher inflation and interest rate rises propping up bond yields for the time being.
U.S. 30-year Treasury yields were not far from their highest level since late-Oct hit earlier this month.

24,"SHANGHAI, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Shipments of smartphones within China rose 30.6% year-on-year to 32.7 million handsets in October, the China Academy of Information and Communications (CAICT) reported late on Tuesday.
The figures follow a large fall that began in the first half of the year, with the revival driven by the release of the latest models of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone, according to a research firm.
Shipment numbers were up from about 25 million in October 2020 and 20.8 million in September 2021, according to the CAICT, a state-backed think-tank.
Research firm Jefferies stated in a note published late on Tuesday that the surge stemmed from the release of the latest iPhone series, as well as Android players getting ready for a sales surge for the then-upcoming nationwide Singles' Day sales period.
Apple launched the iPhone 13 in China in September.
Handset brands are currently experiencing production issues due to a global computer chip shortage.
A combination of factors including demand miscalculation, unexpected factory shutdowns and U.S.-China tensions have prompted a number of automobile companies to report chip sourcing issues.
That shortage has since spread to many types of chips and all kinds of hardware, including smartphones.

30,"JAKARTA, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Indonesia may stop tin exports in 2024 as part of efforts to attract investment into the resource processing industry and improve the country's external balance, President Joko Widodo said on Wednesday.
Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, also reiterated the government may stop allowing exports of bauxite next year and copper ore in 2023.
The president has been making similar remarks during his recent public appearances, arguing that Southeast Asia's largest economy has for too long sold raw commodities, which deprives the country of bigger export earnings and jobs in the manufacturing industry.
Efforts to stop exports of raw commodities and attract investment in downstream industries will improve Indonesia's trade and current account balances, he said, using the example of banning nickel ore exports to attract investment in manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.
""We have started with nickel. Maybe next year, we are calculating, we may stop exports of bauxite. The next year we may be able to stop copper, and the next year tin,"" Jokowi told the central bank's annual gathering with financial stakeholders.
Indonesia, a major exporter of metal ores, stopped exports of nickel ore last year. The move has triggered an influx of investment, mostly from China, into nickel processing.
Under current rules, Indonesia is set to stop exporting bauxite and copper ore, among other metal ores, in 2023.
It was unclear what Jokowi's plans are for tin exports. Since 2018, Indonesia has required tin to be sold in its refined form with at least 95% content.
""We want these resources to be exported as semi-finished goods or as finished goods, because what we want is the added value"" said Jokowi.
The ban on nickel ore exports has led to the European Union lodging a complaint at the World Trade Organization, but the president said such dispute was ""not a problem"" and that Indonesia would continue to welcome foreign investment.",0

The disruption in its online services, including a payments app, is the biggest faced by DBS in about a decade.
Singapore is the biggest retail and wealth management market for DBS, which also has operations in places including Hong Kong, Indonesia and India.
DBS did not elaborate on the cause of the disruption.
DBS' Facebook post attracted more than 2,000 comments, with users saying they were unable to log in onto their digital bank accounts, while some asked for compensation.

Shares of these two companies were up 2.35% and 1.32% respectively, while state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC.NS) was the top gainer on the sub-index, rising as much as 5.32%.
""While there is some easing of crude prices, rising COVID-19 cases is still a worry globally, leading to mixed cues overall,"" said Ajit Mishra, VP research at Religare Broking.
Among domestic factors, he said that continued outflows from foreign investors and underperformance by some sectors will weigh on markets, while the approaching monthly derivatives expiry will keep volatility high.
The Nifty PSU Bank Index (.NIFTYPSU) climbed to 1.74%. Central Bank of India (CBI.NS) and Indian Overseas Bank (IOBK.NS) hit near one-month highs, surging 15%-17.7%, after a report said India planned to privatise the banks.

33,"SYDNEY, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Australia's defence minister won a defamation lawsuit on Wednesday against a refugee advocate who described him as a ""rape apologist"" in a tweet, a small advance in the conservative government's effort to curb damaging commentary on social media.
Peter Dutton, an outspoken cabinet minister, experienced ""hurt and distress"" when shown the Feb. 25 Twitter post by a staff member, although his public profile would have meant most people viewed it as opinion rather than a fact, a federal court judge ruled.
The lawmaker was awarded A$35,000 ($25,000) in damages, a fraction of the maximum amount possible, after the judge found that Dutton had been defamed but his day-to-day life was not impacted by the now-deleted tweet.
The ruling marks another milestone in a campaign by the government to rein in what it has called a ""coward's palace"" of vindictive shared on social media. Earlier this year, former attorney general Christian Porter settled a defamation action against the Australian Broadcasting Corp over Twitter posts about a historic rape allegation which he denied.  read more 
Dutton's lawsuit against activist Shane Bazzi was over a midnight tweet on a day when the politician, who was then immigration minister, defended in media appearances his handling of a complaint about sexual assault inside parliament house.
Bazzi tweeted a link to a 2019 article in which Dutton suggested some refugees claiming to be rape victims were ""trying it on"" to be allowed into Australia, coupled with the sentence ""Peter Dutton is a rape apologist"".
Dutton was accustomed to the ""rough-and-tumble of politics"" but ""deeply offended by the tweet"", noting that Bazzi's account had a blue tick, indicating that he was a verified user, said the judge, Richard White in his published ruling.
The ""description of Mr Dutton as a person who excuses rape was no doubt a serious defamation"" but ""he did not claim to have suffered more serious consequences by reason of the publication of the Tweet or even that his hurt and distress had continued to the date of trial"", the judge added.
A representative for Dutton was not immediately available for comment. Bazzi said in a tweet that was he ""very disappointed with the outcome"" and would consider his options.

The former Atlanta Dream players, now free agents, were involved in a May altercation with other club patrons that was broken up by in-house security personnel.
Marcus Crenshaw, the agent of both players, told Girls Talk Sports TV last month that a group exchanged words with the players and were waiting outside of the club for the players to depart.
On Tuesday, Williams was given a two-game suspension, while Bradford was suspended for one game. Those suspensions also include discipline for related health and safety protocol violations.
The Dream elected to not re-sign either player. Williams led Atlanta in points (16.5), rebounds (6.8) and assists (4.0). Bradford was the team's fifth leading scorer at 8.8 points per game and also averaged 3.8 rebounds with 1.5 assists.
Williams posted a 39-minute video of the incident to YouTube last month before taking it down shortly thereafter. The video showed her and Bradford, along with other club patrons, throwing punches. She later apologized on Twitter.
""I would never want to represent myself or the organization in a negative way,"" Williams said in her Oct. 4 apology Twitter post. ""I'm learning everyday so I ask for grace as I'm growing. Again I apologize to all attached, and I will be better moving forward.""
Both players will have to serve their suspensions starting with he first game they are eligible next season with whatever team(s) they end up joining.

The classification makes it illegal for anyone to be a member of The Base, the white supremacist group formed in 2018, or Hezbollah. Anyone convicted of being a member can be imprisoned for up to 25 years.

Hezbollah is not believed to be active in Australia, though authorities have said The Base has actively sought to develop cells.

39,"2021-11-24 03:28:29 GMT+00:00 - The New York Giants on Tuesday fired Jason Garrett midway through his second season as the team's offensive coordinator.
The move comes one day after the Giants (3-7) again struggled on offense during their 30-10 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Giants head coach Joe Judge was non-committal Tuesday about who would pick up offensive play-calling responsibilities. Reports earlier in the day indicated Freddie Kitchens, the team's senior offensive assistant and former head coach of the Cleveland Browns, would be that coach.
""We're going to handle things collaboratively in-house with the offense and we'll kind of go on as the week goes in terms of specific roles on a game day,"" Judge said Tuesday, adding that ""everything's on the table,"" including the possibility he might call plays.
""Everything's on the table in terms of the offense and how we collectively do things,"" Judge said.
New York's 18.9 points per game this season rank 25th in the NFL, while its 322.8 total yards per game are 23rd in the league. The Giants rank last in red-zone offense with touchdowns on 44.4 percent of drives that reach the opponents' 20.
The sudden midseason ending was ""certainly disappointing,"" Garrett said in a statement in which he also expressed his gratitude to the Mara and Tisch families.
""One of the things that motivated me to accept this position was the opportunity to help rebuild the Giants into a contending team,"" Garrett added. ""We knew there would be many challenges. My expectations for our offense were much greater than what our results have been, and I accept full responsibility for that.""
Judge said a change had to occur for the good of the team.
""I have a lot of respect for Jason as a person and as a coach. He's been a tremendous asset to me as a young head coach,"" Judge said. ""He's done a good job putting the team first. ... With that being said, ultimately, I'll make every decision based on what's best for the team long-term. I feel we have to be more productive as an offense. ... I don't believe we're scoring enough points. It's my job as the head coach to make sure I give our players an opportunity to go out there and make plays.""
The Giants have also seen quarterback Daniel Jones fail to progress in his development since he was selected with the sixth overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft. Jones, 24, has thrown for 2,226 yards with nine touchdowns and seven interceptions in 10 games this season.
""This isn't a blame game. That's not what this is at all. I'm not looking for a head to roll. I'm not worried about external opinions or perception,"" Judge added regarding the decision. ""I'm very appreciative of Jason for a lot of things he's done for us.""
Kitchens and Judge are close friends. But in a test-drive as play-caller against the Browns, Kitchens' offense scored just six points. That cameo came last season when Garrett was out due to COVID protocols and Colt McCoy played for the injured Jones.
Garrett, 55, joined the Giants in 2020 after nine-plus seasons as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.
Garrett went 85-67 in the regular season with the Cowboys, but the squad reached the playoffs just three times. Dallas was 2-3 in those postseason games.
After an 8-8 campaign in 2019, the Cowboys moved on from Garrett, and he was replaced by former Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy.

40,"MELBOURNE, Nov 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Maybe Jamie Dimon learned something about President Xi Jinping’s sense of humour during his recent visit to Hong Kong. The JPMorgan (JPM.N) boss was clearly just looking for a chuckle  read more  on Tuesday when he said he’d wager that his bank would outlast China’s Communist Party, following up with, “I can’t say that in China. They are probably listening anyway.” As others can attest, however, the blowback from Beijing after perceived slights is often no laughing matter.
Dimon is no stranger to impolitic remarks. He harangued regulators including then-Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke about post-financial crisis rules. In 2018, he said he could beat then-President Donald Trump in an election. In 2012, he described a giant JPMorgan trading scandal as a “complete tempest in a teapot.”
UBS (UBSG.S), for one, knows all too well what can happen when a seemingly innocuous comment is blown out of proportion. Back in 2019, one of the Swiss bank’s senior economists landed himself and his employer in hot water after a remark about food inflation and swine fever was misconstrued as a racist slur. He was suspended for three months and UBS lost a plum role on a bond deal for a state-backed client.
Italian fashion giant Dolce and Gabbana’s mainland business suffered heavily after a 2018 series of promotions featured a Chinese model trying to eat pizza and pasta with chopsticks. Qantas (QAN.AX), Zara and Marriott International (MAR.O) are among those who ran into problems after identifying Taiwan as a country in their marketing and websites.
JPMorgan might not be a household brand in China, but it has worked hard to put itself on firm footing there. It was one of the first overseas banks allowed to fully own its domestic investment bank, and last week Dimon was the first Wall Street boss to visit the region since the pandemic began. He was even exempted from Hong Kong’s three-week hotel quarantine.  read more 
Beijing’s reaction, if there is one, might not be immediately obvious. Invitations to pitch for deals can get lost in the post or new approvals sought by the bank could drop to the bottom of a bureaucratic pile. Dimon will know soon enough whether he turned his bank into a Chinese punchline.

41,"MUMBAI, Nov 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The bruising debut  read more  Paytm (PAYT.NS) suffered after last week’s initial public offering stripped it of a stratospheric  valuation. But it’s still looking exuberant with a $13 billion market worth, despite the 31% drop. Buying the super-app is a bet on the company founded by Vijay Shekhar Sharma staying ahead of an onslaught on competition  and regulation. That’s a tough call.
The company that allows users to send money to friends, settle bills, book tickets, take a loan or insurance through its financial partners, and even open a deposit account, tried to calm investors’ nerves on Sunday with an upbeat picture of growth. The gross merchandise value of payments to merchants grew 131% in October, a period usually flattered by festive season sales, compared to the same month last year. That’s four times higher than during each of the previous two full financial years.
Applying this probably inflated growth rate to the current financial year to March 2022 yields a GMV of $71 billion and revenue from operations for Paytm of about $495 million, assuming its so-called take rate stays at last year’s miniscule 0.7%.
That implies Paytm is currently valued at 25 times forward sales. It’s a generous premium to more established payment companies like MasterCard (MA.N) and Visa (V.N) on around 14 times. Fast-growing buy-now-pay-later specialist Afterpay (APT.AX), which Square (SQ.N) is buying, trades at some 17 times. That’s roughly what Prosus (PRX.AS) paid in August for Indian payment processor BillDesk.
Fast growth is a comfort, but masks concerns. Its take rate halved in 2021 compared to 2019, for example, and was low to start with because a big chunk of its payments occur on open digital infrastructure, where the government prohibits fees. Total costs were 1.5 times the top line in the year to March and, while its own payment-processing expenses are falling, they ate up 91% of payment and financial-services revenue.
Paytm’s path to overcoming these, and justifying its rich multiple, is largely out of its hands. It requires officials permitting the industry to charge for peer-to-merchant payments. And it needs regulators to look past the company’s large ownership by China’s Ant and Alibaba (9988.HK) and grant it a licence to lend, which would cut costs. Success on one or both counts would allow it to extract more value from its 22 million registered merchants and make its exuberant valuation look less so.

42,"SYDNEY, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar slipped on Wednesday and bond markets rallied after the country's central bank hiked rates by less than hawks had wagered on, though it also lifted forecasts for how far rates would ultimately have to rise.
The kiwi dollar eased to $0.6917 , from $0.6943, and was testing support around $0.6910/15. A break below would likely see a retreat to the September trough of $0.6860.
The Australian dollar was caught in the downdraught and dipped to $0.7217 , threatening support under $0.7207.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) met most analysts expectations by raising its cash rate 25 basis points to 0.75%, but speculators had been long of the kiwi in hopes of a bigger move to 1.0%.
Minutes of the meeting showed the central bank's committee considered a faster pace of hikes, but chose to be cautious given the continuing pandemic and the very high levels of household debt.  read more 
""The standard move is consistent with the RBNZ's already signalled measured approach to policy tightening, and it is already ahead of most central banks withdrawing policy stimulus,"" said Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr.
That helped bonds rally and two-year swap rates  fell 17 basis points to 2.2150%. Yields on 10-year bonds  dropped 10 basis points to 2.495%.
The RBNZ also revised up the forecast path for rates in the future, seeing it at 1.5% by June compared to a previous call of 1.2%. Rates were seen peaking around 2.6% by the end of 2023, which would be some way above the RBNZ's estimated neutral rate of 2.0% and an outright restrictive stance.
""The new rate track has pulled forward expected hikes and lifted the end point to 2.6%,"" said Kerr. ""We now expect the cash rate to hit 2.5% in 2023, up from 2% previously.""
That is in marked contrast to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has said any hike in its 0.1% cash rate was extremely unlikely next year.
The market is wagering it will have to move much earlier and have 0.25% priced in by June, with rates near 1.0% by year end. .
Domestic data out on Wednesday were fairly upbeat with construction spending dipping by only 0.3% in the third quarter, when analysts had looked for a drop of 3.1%.
That suggests figures for gross domestic product due next week might be a little less dire than feared, though they are still likely to show a sharp contraction given the lockdowns that shut Sydney and Melbourne.",0

48,"SYDNEY, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The dollar paused on Wednesday after a surge that followed the reappointment of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who was seen as the more hawkish choice, while the New Zealand dollar eased after a smaller than expected rate hike.
The euro  held just above a 16-month trough at $1.1238, having found a measure of support from stronger-than-expected European business surveys. The yen  sat just above a four-year low at 115.13 to the dollar.
The kiwi  was the biggest mover in an otherwise quiet Asian session and fell as far as 0.5% to $0.6915 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted rates 25 basis points (bps) and raised its long-term cash rate projection by 50 bps.
Traders had been looking for more on both counts and interest rate swaps reversed sharply after the decision, with benchmark two-year swaps  down 17 bps.  read more 
Westpac strategist Imre Speizer said the unwind of aggressive expectations might be a blueprint for other markets that have become similarly positioned, but in the meantime he reckoned the kiwi could be on the ropes against a rising dollar.
""If it fell below $0.69 I think we're in danger of going below $0.68,"" he said.
The dollar has zoomed to its highest levels of the year as better-than-expected U.S. economic data drives bets the Federal Reserve will hike rates to tame inflation.

The Los Angeles Angels star was selected to the first team as a designated hitter and to the second team as a starting pitcher in honors revealed Tuesday based on voting of fans, media members, ex-players and baseball officials.
Ohtani, previously selected the American League's Most Valuable Player, batted .257 with 46 homers and 100 RBIs. On the mound, he went 9-2 with a 3.18 ERA and 156 strikeouts in 130 1/3 innings.
The Toronto Blue Jays were the lone club to have three players make first-time All-MLB: first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr., second baseman Marcus Semien and starting pitcher Robbie Ray, the AL Cy Young Award winner.

51,"HONG KONG, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Share markets were jittery in early Asia on Wednesday as trading was buffeted by a step-up in U.S. Treasury yields as well as volatile oil prices in the face of price-cooling moves by the United States and other nations.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) slid 0.24%, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock price index (.N225) fell 1.13%, as it returned from holiday and caught up with global falls the day before .
Oil steadied a day after rising 3% to a one-week high, even after the U.S. said it would release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain to try and cool prices after repeated calls for more crude failed to sway OPEC+ producers.  read more 
Brent crude  futures reversed early losses to rise 0.15% to $82.43 a barrel and U.S. crude  futures rose 0.33% to $78.76 a barrel.
""There's a lot going on at the moment,"" said senior Asia economist Carlos Casanova at Swiss private bank UBP.
""10 year yields are rising, and the U.S. dollar is strong, which is a little bit disruptive for Asian markets as a lot of the currencies (apart from the Chinese yuan) will depreciate and there will be some outflows on the back of widening real rate differentials.""
However, ""Chinese asset classes have been holding up relatively well,"" he said, attributing the strength to the People's Bank of China removing several hawkish references from Friday's quarterly monetary policy support, indicating central bank support later this year or early next, ""which will provide a floor for equities.""
Chinese blue chips (.CSI300) were last flat 0.1% and are up about 0.5% so far this week, versus a near 1% fall this week in the Asian regional benchmark. Hong Kong shares (.HSI) lost 0.1%.
Overnight, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  rose more than 5 basis points to as high as 1.684% while yields on 30-year Treasury bond  gained 6 basis points. Two-year  U.S. Treasury yields slipped having touched their highest level since March 2020 on Monday.
""There's a risk that the Fed may speed up tapering (of its bond-buying stimulus programme) and that in turn means the timetable for tightening may be brought forward, contributing to the stronger dollar,"" said currency strategist Sim Moh Siong at Bank of Singapore.

Non-interest bearing gold which had reacted poorly to the rise in Treasury yields, recovered a little. The spot price  was last at $1,794 up 0.2% but still close to Tuesday's two-week low.
Major currencies are largely trading based on market expectations of central banks' interest rate normalisation schedules.
New Zealand's central bank lifted interest rates for the second time in as many months on Wednesday, driven by rising inflationary pressure and as an easing of coronavirus restrictions supported economic activity.

52,"VILLARREAL, Spain Nov 23 (Reuters) - On paper, a Manchester United victory away from home in Europe, especially one that sends them through to the last 16 of the Champions League, is a thing to be celebrated.
But the manner of the 2-0 win in Villarreal on Tuesday night was all too familiar for United fans, with their team below par for much of the contest, before one particular star player bailed them out once more.  read more 
Before Cristiano Ronaldo struck in the 78th minute to break home hearts, however, United keeper David De Gea was forced to make several fine saves to keep Villarreal at bay.
And it was not the first time this season Ronaldo has come to the rescue. United may have reached the last 16 with a group game to spare thanks to their win in the Estadio de la Ceramica, but it has been anything but a smooth ride.
It is the third time this season that the Portuguese forward has scored the decisive goal in the final 15 minutes of a Champions League match.
His stoppage-time winner broke Villarreal hearts in the reverse fixture – a match where De Gea was again needed to keep the Spanish side out on plentiful occasions – before Ronaldo completed a 3-2 comeback victory over Atalanta with another late winner.
Not done there, Ronaldo then fired the pivotal last gasp equaliser in United's last Champions League match at Atalanta – where a loss would have left them up against it to qualify.
In both games against Atalanta and Villarreal, United were second best for long periods of the match. Other poor performances were punished, with United losing seven of their previous 13 in all competitions before Tuesday's trip to Spain – form which saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sacked as coach.
Michael Carrick has come in to take temporary charge, with his first Champions League match following the same pattern as his predecessor's.
""The game panned out as I thought. When you've had results we've had and gone through what we have, it would be very foolish to think it would be freeflowing and everything would be wonderful,"" Carrick said.
""I had a feeling it would be a tight game. I thought we'd be better after half time but it proved to be a little bit tougher at the start of the second half.
""We had players to change it, and in the end it worked out.""
Thanks to Ronaldo - and Jadon Sancho's stoppage-time strike - it did work out for United, but it will take more than the sacking of Solskjaer to lift performance levels at the club.",0
53,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Biden administration has invited Taiwan to its ""Summit for Democracy"" next month, according to a list of participants published on Tuesday, a move likely to infuriate China, which views the democratically governed island as its territory.
The first-of-its-kind gathering is a test of President Joe Biden's assertion, announced in his first foreign policy address in office in February, that he would return the United States to global leadership to face down authoritarian forces led by China and Russia.
There are 110 participants on the State Department's invitation list for the virtual event on Dec. 9 and 10, which aims to help stop democratic backsliding and the erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.  read more  The list does not include China or Russia.
The invite for Taiwan comes as China has stepped up pressure on countries to downgrade or sever relations with the island, which is considered by Beijing to have no right to the trappings of a state.  read more 
Self-ruling Taiwan says Beijing has no right to speak for it.
Sharp differences over Taiwan persisted during a virtual meeting earlier this month between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
While Biden reiterated long-standing U.S. support for the ""One China"" policy under which it officially recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei, he also said he ""strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" the White House said.
Xi said that those in Taiwan who seek independence, and their supporters in the United States, were ""playing with fire,"" according to state news agency Xinhua.
Rights groups question if Biden's Summit for Democracy can push those world leaders who are invited, some accused of harboring authoritarian tendencies, to take meaningful action.
The State Department list shows the event will bring together mature democracies such as France and Sweden but also countries such as the Philippines, India and Poland, where activists say democracy is under threat.

61,"BEIRUT, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Lebanon has yet to give the IMF its estimate of losses in the financial system as discussions on the issue continue, but is working hard to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Fund by year-end, governor Riad Salameh told Reuters on Tuesday.
Disagreements in Lebanon over the size of the losses and how they should be distributed torpedoed IMF talks last year. The central bank, banks and political elite rejected figures set out in a government plan that was endorsed by the IMF at the time.
The issue has obstructed attempts to chart a way out of the crisis that has devastated Lebanon since 2019, sinking the currency by more than 90%, causing poverty to skyrocket and leading many Lebanese to emigrate.
Speaking in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Next conference, Salameh also said the bank had $14 billion of available liquidity in its reserves, and reiterated denials of wrongdoing as judicial authorities in France and Switzerland investigate money laundering allegations against him.
Salameh said an IMF programme was essential for Lebanon to exit the crisis, noting the external financing it would unlock and discipline that would impose reforms.
Therefore the central bank would accept the figures for the losses as decided by the government, he said.
""We are, at this stage, still in the process of gathering the data that is requested by the IMF and the issue of the losses - the number of these losses - are not going to be a hurdle for these negotiations, at least from the side of the central bank,"" he said.
Asked whether there was agreement yet on who will bear the burden of the losses - such as depositors, bank shareholders, the government and the central bank itself - Salameh said no decision had been taken ""because we don't have yet the final figures that are agreed with the IMF for the total losses"".
Last year, several sources said Salameh dug in his heels over the losses which the previous government's plan suggested were in the $70 billion range, although higher figures have been cited. Ruling parties and commercial banks also objected to the figures, saying they were too big.
Asked when the figure would be ready, Salameh said Prime Minister Najib Mikati had set a deadline for signing the IMF memorandum of understanding by the end of 2021, which the government and central bank were working ""very hard to achieve"".
FUNDING NEEDS
Salameh became Banque du Liban (BDL) governor in 1993 and managed a pegged exchange rate that underpinned the import-dependent economy from 1997 until the meltdown.
As Lebanon's currency sunk, the reserves were depleted as BDL provided dollars at heavily subsidised exchange rates to finance imports including fuel, food and medicine.
Salameh noted that this policy had now been largely phased out - the only imports for which dollars are being provided at subsidised rates today are medicines for some chronic illnesses and wheat, while BDL sells dollars for gasoline imports at a small discount to the market exchange rate.
""Our expectation is that if we stay on this model, for the next 12 months ... the BDL will have to fund $2.5 billion,"" he said. BDL might recoup $300-$500 million from its foreign exchange platform, Sayrafa, in that timeframe, he said.
The reserves were recently boosted by the sale of over $1 billion of IMF Special Drawing Rights.
Salameh is being investigated by authorities in four European countries, including the Swiss inquiry over alleged ""aggravated money laundering"" at BDL involving $300 million in gains by a company owned by his brother, Raja Salameh.
Last week, he said he had ordered an audit of transactions and investments that had been the focus of media reports and this had shown no public funds were used to pay fees and commissions to the company owned by his brother. Raja Salameh has not publicly commented on the accusation.
Salameh gave the prime minister a copy of the audit last week but declined to provide Reuters with one. ""In this report, it is clear that there was no embezzlement or money laundering on my side or under my guidance at the central bank,"" he said.

62,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co's (JPM.N) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon joked on Tuesday that his bank would last longer than China's Communist Party.
While reiterating his bank's commitment to doing business in China, Dimon said: ""I made a joke the other day that the Communist Party is celebrating its 100th year - so is JPMorgan. I'd make a bet that we last longer.""
Dimon added: ""I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway."" He was speaking as part of a Boston College series of CEO interviews.
JPMorgan has been operating in China since 1921, the same year the Communist Party was founded there.
It has branches in many Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
In late 2019 the bank received approval to establish a majority-owned securities joint venture, offering brokerage, investment advisory and underwriting services.
In August, the bank won regulatory approval from Beijing to become the first full foreign owner of a securities brokerage in the country.  read more  Its other business interest in China include asset management and futures business.
Global executives typically choose their words carefully when discussing China, where foreign companies have occasionally been subject to backlash for perceived offenses.
In 2019, comments about pigs in China by a senior economist    at UBS (UBSG.S), perceived by some as a racist slur, caused an outcry and prompted one Chinese firm to suspend all business ties with the Swiss bank.
BOOMING ECONOMY
In Boston, Dimon also said he expected inflation from supply chain issues will prove fleeting but that higher oil prices and wages will not go away. He anticipates a percentage point or two of the recent 5% U.S. inflation pace will fade as prices for items such as used cars and lumber stop rising.
""There are other things which are probably not that transitory,"" Dimon said. ""I don't think oil prices are going down.""
Dimon estimated there is about a one-third chance that inflation would be slight enough to bring on moderate increases in market interest rates that do not push the economy into recession.
There's an equal chance that inflation will pick up and push the Federal Reserve to withdraw support for the economy, perhaps causing a mild recession, he said.
Dimon described the U.S. economy as ""booming.""
""Consumers and businesses are in good financial shape and there is still more monetary and fiscal stimulus coming,"" he said.
Asked about cryptocurrencies, Dimon repeated prior warnings to buyers.
""It is not really a currency,"" Dimon said, calling them ""crypto tokens"" with no intrinsic value that have run up in price on speculation fueled by government stimulus payments.
""It is hysteria,"" he said.",0
63,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Four groups of influential Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday to back the issuance of $2 trillion in additional emergency reserves by the International Monetary Fund to help poor countries still struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The chairs of the Congressional Progressive, Black, Hispanic, and Asian Pacific American Caucuses told Yellen in a letter seen by Reuters that U.S. backing for a new allocation of IMF reserves would provide needed support for hundreds of millions of people in developing countries, where vaccination rates lag far behind those in advanced economies, while underpinning global growth.
In the letter the lawmakers welcomed Yellen's support for a $650 billion allocation of IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in August, and asked her to support a measure passed by the House of Representatives in July that called for issuance of 1.5 trillion more SDRs, valued at around $2 trillion.
""A new issuance of 1.5 trillion SDRs remains a vital tool for this administration’s efforts to crush the coronavirus and build back better, both at home and abroad,"" they wrote.
A congressional aide said ""aggressive action"" was needed to address the pandemic's global impacts, particularly for low-income countries, and the caucuses want to ensure support from President Joe Biden's administration for additional SDRs, given ""the potential to advance racial justice.""
The lawmakers' letter said that this year's IMF SDR allocation had been used in full by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, including Chad, Lebanon, Ecuador, Malawi, Tunisia and Ethiopia.
The amount of SDRs used in the three months since the issuance was 21 times greater than what had been used in the first three months after the last issuance in 2009, they said.
Lawmakers are seeking Yellen's support as they work to finalize appropriations for the coming fiscal year. The House  measure must still be passed by the Senate.
The IMF has estimated that developing countries will need some $2.5 trillion to cover their financing needs in the wake of the pandemic and the economic disruption it has caused.
The August issuance was the IMF's largest-ever distribution of monetary reserves, providing additional liquidity for the global economy, supplementing member countries’ foreign exchange reserves and reducing their reliance on external debt.",0
64,"BANGKOK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Thai monetary policy must stay accommodative to support fiscal policy, while fiscal measures introduced must be supportive of business and households, the finance minister said on Wednesday, as the government tries to breathe life into its economy.
Future government measures will be for easing the pandemic  impact and Thailand must shift to focusing on the domestic economy from high external dependence, Finance minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith told a business seminar.
Bank of Thailand Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput also told the seminar that fiscal and monetary policy must coordinate to help the economy, which is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2023.
Fiscal policy will remain key for the economic recovery, which will be slow and uneven, he said.
Southeast Asia's second largest economy bottomed out in the third quarter and will grow close to forecasts, according to minutes of the BOT's last policy meeting released on Wednesday. 
The BOT forecast economic growth of 0.7% this year and 3.9% next year. It has left its benchmark interest rate(THCBIR=ECI) at a record low of 0.50% since May 2020.",0
65,"SINGAPORE, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Singapore's economy is expected to grow about 7% in 2021, at the top of the official forecast range, and will expand at a slower pace next year as an uneven recovery continues across sectors, the government said on Wednesday.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) forecast the economy to grow 3% to 5% next year.
""The recovery of the various sectors of the economy is expected to remain uneven in 2022,"" said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
He expects outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade to remain strong, while activity in aviation- and tourism-related sectors would remain below pre-COVID levels throughout 2022.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.1% year-on-year in the third quarter, the MTI said, higher than the 6.5% expansion seen in the government's advance estimate and analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded 1.3% in the third quarter.
The small and open economy, which has fully vaccinated about 85% of its 5.45 million population, eased some COVID-19 safety measures this week and has opened quarantine-free travel lanes with several countries.
""Recovery has definitely started, the reopening borders and easing of mobility restrictions could help consumer facing sectors,"" Maybank Kim Eng economist Lee Ju Ye. ""But it's still going to be a slow pace of normalisation.""
The MTI said protracted supply disruptions alongside a stronger pickup in demand, as well as rising energy commodity prices, could lead to more persistent inflation.
External inflationary pressures are likely to remain elevated, while wage growth is expected to strengthen as the domestic labour market continues to recover.
Around the world, policymakers have turned their attention to inflationary risks from supply constraints and a recovery in the global economy.
Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy in a surprise move at its last meeting in October. At least five economists expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to act again at its next policy meeting in April.
The MAS will carefully watch inflation dynamics and stay vigilant on price developments when it decides its next policy move, expected in April, Edward Robinson, its deputy managing director, told a media briefing.
Singapore kept its forecast for headline inflation to come in at about 2% this year, and average 1.5-2.5% in 2022.
Data this week showed Singapore's key price gauge rose by the fastest pace in nearly three years in October, mainly driven by higher services and food inflation, while headline inflation rose at the fastest pace since March 2013.  read more

66,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday called on energy companies to explain ""their decisions to export record amounts of natural gas while imposing massive price increases"" on consumers, accusing them of ""corporate greed"" while Americans struggle to pay their bills.
Warren sent letters to 11 energy companies, including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N).
""The cause of rapidly rising energy prices for consumers and manufacturers is clear: some of the nation's largest and most profitable oil and gas companies are putting their massive profits, share prices and dividends for investors, and millions of dollars in CEO pay and bonuses ahead of the needs of American consumers and the nation’s recovery from the pandemic,"" Warren wrote in letters sent to the companies and posted on her website.
Warren said she was concerned about ""the extent to which these price increases are being driven by energy companies’ corporate greed and profiteering.""
She called on the companies to detail, for the past 10 years, their natural gas exports, percentage of total natural gas production exported, average profit margin for exported natural gas, average profit margin for domestic sales of natural gas, and the amount invested in clean, renewable energy. Warren asked for replies by Dec. 7.
Letters were also sent to EQT (EQT.N)                , Coterra                 , BP (BP.L)                , Antero Resources (AR.N)                , Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.O)                , Ascent Resources, Southwestern Energy Co (SWN.N)                and Range Resources Corp (RRC.N)                .

The United States has administered 452,657,967 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Monday morning, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The figure is up from the 451,453,834 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Nov 21.
The agency said 230,732,565 people had received at least one dose, while 196,398,948 people are fully vaccinated, as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday.

68,"TEGUCIGALPA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Honduran presidential candidate Xiomara Castro has not made a final decision on whether to recognize China over Taiwan, a close aide said Tuesday, ahead of Sunday elections in which the question has emerged as a major issue.
Castro, of the leftist Libre party, faces the ruling National Party's Nasry Asfura, in the Nov. 28 presidential vote, with a poll last month showing the opposition contender with a commanding double-digit lead.
""There isn't a definitive decision,"" Hugo Noe, a Castro adviser who leads her platform-writing team, told Reuters.
Two-term Tegucigalpa mayor Asfura has not taken a position on the diplomatic tug-of-war.
Honduras is one of just 15 countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which China claims has no right to state-to-state relations.
Castro, the wife of former President Manuel Zelaya, had previously said if victorious she would switch the Central American country's diplomatic relations to Beijing, over Taipei.
Noe, a former finance minister and central bank head, stressed Castro's final decision would depend on ""the advantages and disadvantages that other sectors might propose,"" noting further consultations will be carried out.
Earlier this month, outgoing President Juan Orlando Hernandez visited the Taiwanese capital, expressing his desire that Honduras would continue its friendship with the island  that China considers a breakaway province.
China's efforts to win over Taiwan's remaining allies have worried the United States, which has been especially concerned about Beijing's growing influence in Central America and the Caribbean.
""That would be one of the elements to be evaluated,"" said Noe, referring to U.S. sensitivities.
""We would have to take those elements into account because other things, like Honduran (migrants) in the United States, our trade ties, would also be at stake,"" he added.",0
69,"SEOUL, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Little known sect led by a pastor who pokes eyes to heal is at the centre of a COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea, as the country reported a new daily record of 4,116 cases for Tuesday and battles a spike in serious cases straining hospitals.
In a tiny rural church in a town of 427 residents in Cheonan city, south of Seoul, at least 241 people linked to the religious community had tested positive for coronavirus, a city official told Reuters on Wednesday.
Many of the congregation were elderly in their 60s and above and were unvaccinated, the official said. Just 17 out of the 241 confirmed cases had been vaccinated.
""I believe it's the church's anti-government beliefs that refrained the believers to get the vaccine,"" the official said, adding that the town was put under a lockdown.
The church opened in the early 1990s and has ever since become larger with communal living facilities of its own.
The religion is not officially registered as a sect, however the ritual act the pastor performs is known as the so called ""imposition of hands on eyes"", a practice of poking two eyes to rid of secular desire, Jung youn-seok, a head of cult information resources think tank told Reuters.
""Such act is extremely dangerous and nonbiblical. It is an outright ban in Korean Christianity,"" Jung said, adding that the pastor's mother was a powerful figure and was ousted from Christian community in the 1990s for practicing identical rituals.
Calls to the church from Reuters went unanswered.
The outbreak is a small portion of the national total, but is an example of a cluster with a high concentration of cases.
Shincheonji was a church at the centre of the first major coronavirus epidemic outside China early 2020, with at least  5,227 people linked to its 310,000 followers infected after attending a service in the city of Daegu.
EMERGENCY PLAN IMMINENT
South Korea this month switched to a ""living with COVID-19"" plan aimed at lifting rigid distancing rules and ultimately reopening after reaching vaccination goals last month.
Looking at the metropolitan Seoul area alone, the situation is critical enough to impose an emergency plan at any time, Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum told a COVID-19 response meeting on Wednesday.
He called on health authorities to classify the patients accordingly based on the severity of the symptoms and make use of self-treatment options for mild or asymptomatic cases.
Less than 20% were treating themselves at home last week, Kim said.
The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) had said the emergency plan may be imposed if and when the nationwide ICU bed capacity surpasses 75% or depending on the risk assessment that reviews medical response shortfalls, surge in number of elderly patients and uptake in booster shots.
Hospitals were treating 586 severe COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday midnight, rapidly filling up limited hospital beds for serious and critical cases. More than 85% of them were aged 60 or above, KDCA data showed.
71% of the ICU beds were filled up nationwide and 83.7% in capital Seoul and neighbouring areas alone, Son Young-rae, a senior health ministry official, told a briefing, stressing ministry efforts to secure more beds with administrative order.
Hundreds were still awaiting for their beds.
Despite the increase in hospitalisation rate, the country's mortality rate remains relatively low at 0.79%.
South Korea was one of the first countries to record novel coronavirus cases after it emerged in China in late 2019. It has since had 425,065 infections, with 3,363 deaths.
The country has fully vaccinated 79.1% of its 52 million people, while just 4.1% have been given a booster dose.",0

Activity in the services sector also accelerated, expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years as economic conditions stabilised after a sharp decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths thanks to soaring vaccinations.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.2, its fastest pace of expansion since January 2018.
The reading, which was lifted by a pickup in overall output and new orders, compared to a final 53.2 in the previous month.

Manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead eased slightly from the previous month, according to the survey, which also showed firms across sectors faced soaring price pressures.
""Input prices across the private sector rose at the fastest pace for over 13 years with businesses attributing the rise to higher raw material, freight and staff costs amid shortages and deteriorating supplier performance,"" Bhatti said.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI Index improved to a seasonally adjusted 52.1 from the previous month's final of 50.7, putting it more firmly into expansion territory.

71,"SINGAPORE, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat rose on Wednesday for a fourth consecutive session to scale its highest level since December 2012 as concerns about global supplies underpinned the market.
Soybeans gained ground after closing lower although worries about world demand kept a lid on prices.
""We don't see a downside for wheat prices as we are still waiting to see what happens to the Northern Hemisphere harvest,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank.
""Global wheat stocks are low and protein levels are a concern.""
The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT)  was up 0.1% at $8.68-3/4 a bushel, as of 0244 GMT, near the session high of $8.71 a bushel, the highest since December 2012.
Soybeans  were up 0.3% at $12.77 a bushel and corn  added a quarter of a cent to $5.88-1/2 a bushel.
Concerns about tightening global supplies have supported wheat prices, as rains stalled harvesting in Australia and threatened grain quality. Flooding has also disrupted shipments from western Canada, while prices in Russia, the world's top wheat exporter, have climbed steadily.
Early harvest results for Australia's near record wheat crop are showing lower-than-expected protein levels, raising concerns over supplies to a market already suffering shortfalls from key Northern Hemisphere exporters. 
Dry conditions in the U.S. winter wheat belt also fuelled early worries about next year's harvest.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Monday that 44% of the U.S. winter wheat crop was in good-to-excellent condition, down from 46% a week earlier. Analysts on average had expected an unchanged score. 
The agency cut on Tuesday its U.S. farm exports forecast for next year, citing weaker soybean demand from China and lower bean prices.  read more

72,"MELBOURNE, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Australia's test cricketers were shocked to learn of Tim Paine's resignation from the captaincy over a 'sexting' scandal but are fully behind him to continue as wicketkeeper for the Ashes, batsman Marcus Harris said.
Opener Harris said players only became aware of Paine's decision half an hour before he went public last Friday to reveal he had been investigated over lewd text messages sent to a female Cricket Tasmania staffer four years ago.
""People were obviously a bit shocked but we’ve got a lot of good leaders around our group,"" Harris told reporters on Wednesday.
""So it’s not ideal but someone’s going to have to step up and lead from the front.
""Painey will still be around and can still show leadership in many different ways but we’re looking forward to getting into camp and getting on with it.""
Paine, who has been playing a domestic match in Tasmania this week while other test players are on the Gold Coast, is the only specialist wicketkeeper in Australia's 15-man Ashes squad.
However, selectors chairman George Bailey has confirmed he is no lock for the first test starting in Brisbane on Dec. 8 while he races to prove himself match-fit after neck surgery.
Harris said Paine was very popular among the playing group, had done a ""really good job"" under tough circumstances over the last few years and deserved to keep his place in the side.
""I think you’d probably still argue that he’s still the best gloveman in the country and he still played a few important innings last summer against India,"" he said.
""I know he’s got all the support of the players and like I said, all that other stuff is up to people above me.""
Paine's resignation and Cricket Australia's handling of the sexting scandal have triggered recriminations, with Cricket Tasmania accusing the national body of hanging the wicketkeeper out to dry having cleared him of any wrongdoing in 2018.  read more

Thompson, who has won three championships with the Warriors and is considered one of the best shooters off all time, said Poole has steadily improved both offensively and defensively because of his willingness to push himself.
""To see his growth as a player, it's incredible,"" Thompson said of Poole, who is averaging 18.4 points per game on 45.8% shooting from the field, including 33.3% from three-point range.
""It makes me proud to see because he reminded me of myself when I was in my younger years. The way he would react emotionally to missing shots or having a bad game, I could tell it really bothered him.
""You like to see that as a vet because that means the guy really cares about his craft.""

The confirmation vote will be held on Wedesday.
Andersson took over as leader of the Social Democrats from outgoing prime minister Stefan Lofven earlier this month, but needs support from outside the ruling minority coalition with the Greens to be confirmed as his successor.

76,"TOKYO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) second-largest shareholder on Wednesday objected to the Japanese conglomerate's plan to split itself into three companies and called on it to instead solicit offers from potential buyers.
Hedge fund 3D Investment Partners, which owns more than 7% of Toshiba, laid out its objections in a three-page letter to the company's board, becoming the first major shareholder to formally oppose the break-up plan outlined this month.
The letter, seen by Reuters, highlights shareholder discomfort over Toshiba's proposal - an unease reflected in the company's recent weak stock performance - and raises the possibility that the break-up may struggle to win approval at a shareholder meeting early next year.
A Toshiba spokesperson said it does not comment on individual exchanges with shareholders. 3D declined to comment.
The proposed break-up is ""extremely unlikely"" to resolve any of Toshiba's current problems and ""is instead very likely to create three underperforming companies in the image of today's Toshiba,"" Singapore-based 3D said in the letter.
Some other hedge fund shareholders have also told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, that they were disappointed Toshiba had turned down the idea of going private.
In its letter, 3D said Toshiba should ""open a formal process, develop a compelling plan for each of the businesses, provide detailed diligence materials and management meetings to interested financial and strategic parties, encourage and enable stretch proposals from those parties and evaluate the best path forward"".
Toshiba launched its strategic review after pressure from investors following a governance scandal over management's alleged collusion with Japan's trade ministry to pressure foreign shareholders.
FIVE-MONTH REVIEW
During the five-month review, Toshiba's review committee held talks with six private equity firms, which sources said included KKR & Co (KKR.N) and Brookfield (BAMa.TO), seeking strategic ideas including going private.
While the review committee never conducted an auction process with due diligence for a possible sale, it has said talks with private equity firms suggested potential offers were ""not compelling relative to market expectations"".
The review committee, which consists of five external board directors, has said it did not receive any bona fide proposals to take the company private. The idea of going private, it has said, raised concerns inside Toshiba.
However, in its letter - which was also addressed to the review committee - 3D criticised the committee for what it said was a failure to ask for proposals for the sale of Toshiba, or the partial disposition of some of its businesses.
""Overly reliant upon an intransigent management team's uninspired projection model and dubious claims of regulatory, employee morale and customer concerns about a different ownership structure, the (committee) appears to have compromised its review and relented,"" the fund said.
3D, founded by former Goldman Sachs banker Kanya Hasegawa in 2015, was one of dozens foreign hedge funds that participated in a $5.4 billion capital injection Toshiba received during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.
In addition to Toshiba, 3D has stakes in a number of smaller Japanese firms including IT company Fuji Soft Inc (9749.T), textile and technology firm Daiwabo Holdings Co Ltd (3107.T) and music publisher Avex Inc (7860.T), according to Refinitiv data based on filings this year.
It also owns a stake U.S.-based biotech MediciNova Inc (MNOV.O), according to Refinitv.
Founded in 1875, Toshiba plans to house its energy and infrastructure divisions in one company while its hard disk drive and power semiconductor businesses will form the backbone of another. A third will manage Toshiba's stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia Holdings and other assets.

""On our pricing model, such a release would be worth less than $2/bbl, significantly less than the $8/bbl sell-off that occurred since late October,"" the bank said in a note titled ""A drop in the ocean"", dated Nov. 23.
Global oil prices rebounded to a one-week high on Tuesday after the move by the United States and other consumer nations to release oil from strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) to try to cool the market fell short of some expectations.  read more 
On Wednesday, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude  was down 35 cents to $78.15 a barrel by 0031 GMT.
""The aggregate size of the release of about 70-80 mb (million barrels) was smaller than the 100+ mb the market had been pricing in, with the swap nature of most of these barrels implying an even smaller, about 40 million barrels net, increase in oil supplies over 2022-23,"" Goldman said.
""That is in the context of a market drawing up to 2mb/d at present.""
Brent crude prices have also priced in an additional hit to global oil demand of 1.5 million barrels per day for the next three months from the impact of COVID-19 in Europe and China, Goldman said.
""We view these as likely excessive concerns over the next three months, leaving the recent sell-off overshooting fundamentals due to the year-end decline in trading activity,"" the bank said.
While the coordinated government stock releases would warrant a $2 a barrel downgrade to the bank's year-end Brent price forecast, it expects the lack of progress on negotiations with Iran to offset risks.
Global powers and Iran will meet on Monday to revive talks on a nuclear deal that could lift U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil, allowing Tehran to increase exports.
""In addition, OPEC could consider halting its production hikes to offset the detrimental SPR impact of lower oil prices on the needed recovery in global oil capex, likely justifying such action as prudent in the face of COVID demand risks,"" the bank said.",0
78,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday it will release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, to try to cool prices after OPEC+ producers repeatedly ignored calls for more crude.
Biden, facing low approval ratings amid rising inflation ahead of next year's congressional elections, has grown frustrated at repeatedly asking the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, to pump more oil without any response.
""I told you before that we're going to take action on these problems. That's exactly what we're doing,"" Biden said in remarks broadcast from the White House.
""It will take time, but before long you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank, and in the longer-term we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy,"" he said.
Crude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs, and consumers are feeling the pain of the increase in fuel costs. Retail gasoline prices are up more than 60% in the last year, the fastest rate of increase since 2000, largely because people have returned to the roads as pandemic-induced restrictions have eased and demand has rebounded.
Under the plan, the United States will release 50 million barrels, the equivalent of about two and a half days of U.S. demand. India, meanwhile, said it would release 5 million barrels, while Britain said it would allow the voluntary release of 1.5 million barrels of oil from privately held reserves.
Japan will hold auctions for about 4.2 million barrels of oil, about 1 or 2 days worth of its demand, out of its national stockpile by the end of the year, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Wednesday.  read more 
Details on the amount and timing of the release of oil from South Korea and China were not announced. Seoul said it would decide after discussions with the United States and other allies. 
The price of oil rebounded on Tuesday, after falling for several days as rumors of the plans made their way into the market. Some analysts also attributed the market's rebound to the lack of firm details out of China, though Reuters reported last week that the country has been working on such a release. Brent crude  futures rose 3.3% on Tuesday to $82.31 a barrel.
It was the first time that the United States had coordinated such a move with some of the world's largest Asian oil consumers, officials said.
OPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the Gulf, as well as Russia, has rebuffed requests to pump more at its monthly meetings. It meets again on Dec. 2 to discuss policy but has so far shown no indication it will change tack.
The group has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month - a pace Washington sees as too slow - and it remains worried that a resurgence of coronavirus cases could again drive down demand. 
Recent high oil prices have been caused by a sharp rebound in global demand, which cratered early in the pandemic in 2021, and analysts have said that releasing reserves may not be enough to curb further rises.
""It's not large enough to bring down prices in a meaningful way and may even backfire if it prompts OPEC+ to slow the pace at which it is raising output,"" said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics Ltd.
The administration has also pointed to a notable gap between the price of unfinished gasoline futures and the retail cost of gasoline, which has widened to about $1.14 a gallon from roughly 78 cents in mid-October. The White House urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the issue last week.
Biden's political opponents, meanwhile, seized on the announcement to criticize his administration's efforts to decarbonize the U.S. economy and discourage new fossil fuel development on federal lands.
""Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will not fix the problem. We are experiencing higher prices because the administration and Democrats in Congress are waging a war on American energy,"" said Senator John Barrasso, the ranking Republican on the Senate energy committee.
The release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be a combination of a loan and a sale to companies, U.S. officials said. The 32 million-barrel loan will take place over the next several months, while the administration would accelerate a sale of 18 million barrels already approved by Congress to raise funds for the budget.
WARNING TO OPEC
The effort by Washington to team up with major Asian economies to lower energy prices acts as a warning to OPEC and other big producers that they need to address concerns about high crude prices, up more than 50% so far this year.
""It sends a signal to OPEC+ that the consuming nations are not going to get pushed around any more by them,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. ""OPEC+ has been stingy with their output for months now.""
Suhail Al-Mazrouei, energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, one of OPEC's biggest producers, said before details of the release of U.S. reserves were announced that he saw ""no logic"" in lifting UAE supply for global markets.
An OPEC+ source said releasing reserves would complicate calculations for OPEC+, as it monitors the market on a monthly basis. However, they and several market analysts said the release was not as big as the headline figure suggested. They said Britain and India were releasing modest amounts and the United States had already announced some releases, and so the additional quantity was less than expected.
The United States historically has worked on coordinated stocks releases with the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), a bloc of 30 industrialised energy consuming nations.
Japan and South Korea are IEA members. China and India are only associate members.",0
79,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - A federal jury in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Tuesday found the organizers of the 2017 ""Unite the Right"" white nationalist rally liable for injuries sustained by counter-protesters and awarded approximately $26 million in damages.
The nine plaintiffs in the case said they suffered physical or emotional trauma at the rally, including four who were struck when a self-described neo-Nazi, James Fields, drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.
After a four-week trial, the jury found in favor of the victims on four of six counts but was unable to come to a unanimous verdict on the other two, according to court filings.
The rally followed months of protests over the city's plan to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Hundreds of white nationalists traveled to Charlottesville in August 2017, with some marching on the University of Virginia campus carrying torches and chanting ""Jews will not replace us!""
Then-President Donald Trump was criticized for initially saying there were ""fine people on both sides"" after the rally devolved into violent clashes.
President Joe Biden has frequently cited the torch-lit march and Trump's response as the event that precipitated his decision to mount another run for the White House, after two previous unsuccessful campaigns.
""We are thrilled that the jury has delivered a verdict in favor of our plaintiffs, finally giving them the justice they deserve after the horrific weekend of violence and intimidation in August 2017,"" the plaintiffs' co-lead lawyers, Roberta Kaplan and Karen Dunn, said in a statement.
The two dozen defendants included Jason Kessler, the main organizer; Richard Spencer, who originated the term ""alt-right,"" a loose network of groups characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics that includes white supremacists and neo-Nazis; and several white nationalist groups.
Joshua Smith, one of the defense lawyers, told reporters he viewed the jury's inability to reach a consensus on two federal conspiracy counts as a ""victory"" given the disparity in resources between the plaintiffs' and defendants' legal teams.
The victims sued for assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of both Virginia and U.S. civil rights laws.
The defendants argued that they were exercising their constitutional rights and had secured a legal permit for the rally, blaming the deadly violence on Fields, the driver who killed Heyer, and others.
Fields was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of murder and hate crimes.
The lawsuit received financial support from a nonprofit civil rights group, Integrity First for America.
In a statement released by the organization, the plaintiffs said, ""Our single greatest hope is that today’s verdict will encourage others to feel safer raising our collective voices in the future to speak up for human dignity and against white supremacy.""",0

81,"WELLINGTON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand will keep its borders closed to most international travellers for a further five months, the government said on Wednesday, outlining a cautious easing of coronavirus border curbs that have been in place for nearly two years.
Along with its geographic isolation, the South Pacific country enforced some of the tightest pandemic restrictions among OECD nations, limiting the spread of COVID-19 and helping its economy bounce back faster than many of its peers.
But an outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant earlier this year has forced a shift in strategy, with the main city of Auckland now only gradually opening up as vaccination rates climb.
Fully vaccinated international travellers will be allowed to enter the country from April 30, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins told a news conference. The travellers will have to self-isolate for seven days on arrival.
Vaccinated New Zealanders and residence visa holders in neighbouring Australia can travel to New Zealand from Jan. 16, while vaccinated New Zealanders and residence visa holders most from other countries will be allowed in from Feb. 13.
""A phased approach to reconnecting with the world is the safest approach to ensure risk is carefully managed,"" Hipkins said.
""This reduces any potential impacts on vulnerable communities and the New Zealand health system.""
Travellers will no longer be required to stay at state quarantine facilities, he said, but other measures will be put in place including self-isolation, a negative pre-departure test, proof of being fully vaccinated, and a COVID-19 test on arrival.
Pressure has been mounting on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to reopen international borders ahead of the Christmas holidays so that expatriate New Zealanders could return home.

82,"(Reuters) - A trio of large law firms said Tuesday that they'll pay year-end associate bonuses on a scale largely matching that of frequent industry pay pacesetter Cravath, Swaine & Moore, amid a highly competitive market for lawyer recruitment.
Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and Boies Schiller Flexner all said they'd pay bonuses this year ranging from $15,000 for first-year associates up to $115,000 for the most senior. Boies Schiller and Cadwalader also said they'd offer additional cash for associates who have clocked extra billable hours.
Cravath kicked off the latest round of bonuses Monday, increasing rates for associates across the board, including by 15% over last year's payouts for the most experienced associates.
Associates at many large firms during the last 18 months have been showered with additional cash from their employers, as demand for their work has surged, especially in transactional practices. Payouts aside from end-of-year bonuses have come in the form of salary raises and ""special bonuses,"" often paid in installments.
Boies Schiller said in its Tuesday bonus memo that it would pay “extraordinary” and “extra-extraordinary” end-of-year bonuses of up to $140,000 for associates billing 2,350 hours this year or more, and up to $150,000 for those billing 2,600 or more.
The litigation firm’s associate headcount has dwindled amid a firmwide restructuring and a slew of partner departures. London-based partner Natasha Harrison, once seen as next in line to run Boies Schiller, is set to leave, two sources close to the firm said last week.
Cadwalader said in its Tuesday bonus announcement that its associates working 2,200 or more billable hours this year will receive 120% of the firm's set year-end bonuses.
In addition to cash, some firms in recent months have offered gift incentives to associates. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom is giving associates a “holiday appreciation gift” that includes an iPad Pro 11, according to a firm memo published by Above the Law on Tuesday.
More large firms are likely to reveal their associate bonus payouts before the end of 2021.
Michelle Fivel, a partner at legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, said she expects most will fall in line with Cravath's bonuses, but wouldn't be “shocked” if another firm ups the ante.

83,"CHICAGO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) cut its U.S. farm exports forecast for next year on Tuesday, citing weaker soybean demand from China and lower bean prices.
USDA's Economic Research Service said it now expects U.S. agricultural exports to hit $175.5 billion in fiscal year 2022, down $2.0 billion from its August forecast.
The agency said soybean exports were expected to be down $3.9 billion, to $28.4 billion, while soybean meal exports were forecast to slump $800 million to $4.9 billion due to lower prices. The fiscal year started on Oct. 1, 2021.
The news comes as China's October soybean imports from the United States have declined sharply this fall during what is normally a boom time, amid poor crush margins and intense price competition from Brazilian beans. 
U.S. grain exports also slumped earlier this fall, as shippers struggled to restart loading operations along the Louisiana Gulf Coast after Hurricane Ida damaged grain terminals and knocked out power across the region.  read more 
China is expected to remain the largest U.S. agricultural market, the agency said. Agricultural exports to China are expected to be $36.0 billion, a $3.0 billion drop from USDA's August projection — but still a record amount, USDA said.
The cooling of soybean exports is expected to be partially offset by increases in livestock, poultry, dairy, cotton, and ethanol exports, USDA said.
""Grain and feed exports are also revised down by $300 million to $41.5 billion, with corn, sorghum, and rice exports each down $100 million,"" USDA said on its website.
Wheat exports are expected to remain steady from the previous forecast at $7.1 billion.",0
84,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - In June, managers at location data startup Mapbox came to employees with alarming news: The company had lost a $150 million investment, and worker organizing was to blame.
Prior to the all-hands meeting over Zoom, roughly two-thirds of the SoftBank-backed startup’s workers had signed cards indicating their desire to unionize, part of a wave of organizing in Silicon Valley.
But after Mapbox management disclosed the botched investment – and said they worried funding trouble would persist if workers formed a union – the tide turned, one current and one former employee said. Workers at Mapbox, which was valued at more than $1 billion in its most recent private funding round and has engaged with so-called blank check companies about going public, voted against unionization in August.
Mapbox's response offers a window into how tech companies are pushing back as unions seek to bring workers into the fold.
In recent years, the Communications Workers of America and the Office and Professional Employees International Union have launched campaigns in Silicon Valley, organizing workers at startups such as Kickstarter and Glitch. The CWA also formed the Alphabet Workers Union, a so-called minority union that does not have collective bargaining rights.
As unions continue engaging with workers, a playbook among tech companies is emerging, according to interviews with tech workers and union organizers: Warn employees about the impact a union would have on the startup’s prospects and, in particular, its ability to raise funds. Remind workers of their privilege to cast doubt on why they need a union. And hire law firms and consultants to help drive the point home.
“Tech firms are willing to do whatever is necessary to keep unions out,” said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University. “They might think unions are fine for food-processing workers or for miners, but not in the tech sector.”
SHIFTING POWER DYNAMIC
The unions’ pushes are at an early stage, and it remains to be seen whether they will catch on widely. But the growing receptiveness in a sector long regarded as indifferent to organized labor speaks to a broader renegotiation of power that is playing out between tech companies and their employees, interviews with workers suggest.
For many tech workers, the promise of a generous payday is no longer enough. They also want sound working conditions and assurances that the products they are building will not harm society, tech employees and organizers say.
Yet workers at high-risk, high-reward startups are loath to jeopardize the value of their stock options, or put their jobs at risk. That is why warnings about funding can be so effective, said Wes McEnany, a senior CWA campaign lead.
In addition to Mapbox, management also said unionization could imperil future funding at Kickstarter and Glitch, according to former employees. Medium Chief Executive Ev Williams told workers that investors might shy away if the union prevailed, McEnany said.
""After considering the benefits and costs, our employees voted overwhelmingly against forming a union,"" Mapbox said in a statement. ""It was their decision to make, and they made it unambiguously. We’re now focused on growing our business and supporting our customers.""
Kickstarter and Glitch declined to comment. Williams did not respond.
Under U.S. law, companies may not threaten workers that they will lose their jobs if they unionize, but they can predict adverse consequences, said Gordon Lafer of the University of Oregon's Labor Education and Research Center.
A VERY SCARY NUMBER
Some investors and financial advisers interviewed by Reuters said they view unions at startups as a drawback because they make it more difficult for companies to lay off workers and introduce more rules around compensation.
Yet Roy Bahat, head of venture capital firm Bloomberg Beta, said he doubted investors would pass up the chance to invest in a hot startup because it had a unionized workforce.
""In the same way that (venture capitalists) overcome lots of obstacles to investing – everything from PR dilemmas to regulatory vulnerabilities to cofounder issues – unions are just another aspect of a company,"" Bahat said. ""They’re not fatal.""
In August, Jackson Lewis, a law firm known for its work in union avoidance, released a podcast episode titled: “The Unlikely Marriage of Unions and Tech Employees.” Jackson Lewis lawyer Laura Pierson-Scheinberg said she was inspired to record the podcast by the increasing number of calls she received from tech companies inquiring about the prospect of union campaigns.
The shift to working from home has weakened ties between companies and workers, creating an opening for unions, Pierson-Scheinberg said.
Mapbox is known for its strong ties to nonprofits. But in recent years, some workers grew worried about how the mapping technology was being used by clients, one current and one former employee said.
Mapbox’s relationship with software company Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR.N) was of particular concern, one former employee said. Workers also wanted to formalize support for colleagues in the event of future layoffs.
Palantir could not immediately be reached for comment.
On their website, members of the Mapbox Workers Union wrote that they banded together ""to build a lasting, accountable, inclusive Mapbox.""
Mapbox management presented a variety of arguments against unionization, but funding concerns were especially resonant with workers. As management mentioned the failed investment over Zoom, several workers could be seen shaking their heads, according to one employee. Afterward, some workers who had supported the union told organizers they had had a change of heart.
The botched $150 million investment ""was a very large and very scary number,"" one employee said. ""The fear that that instilled didn’t go away.""",0

86,"OSLO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The world's first fully electric and self-steering container ship, owned by fertiliser maker Yara (YAR.OL), is preparing to navigate Norway's southern coast and play its part in the country's plans to clean-up its industry.
The Yara Birkeland, an 80-metre-long (87 yards) so-called feeder, is set to replace lorry haulage between Yara's plant in Porsgrunn in southern Norway and its export port in Brevik, about 14 km (8.7 miles) away by road, starting next year.
It will cut 1,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year, equivalent to 40,000 diesel-powered journeys by road, and is expected to be fully autonomous in two years.
For Yara it means reducing CO2 emissions at its plant in Porsgrunn, one of Norway's single largest sources of CO2, Chief Executive Svein Tore Holsether said.
""Now we have taken this technological leap to show it is possible, and I'm thinking there are so many routes in the world where it is possible to implement the same type of ship,"" he told Reuters.
Built by Vard Norway, Kongsberg (KOG.OL) provided key technology including the sensors and integration required for remote and autonomous operations.
""This isn't about replacing the sailors, it's replacing the truck drivers,"" Yara's Jostein Braaten, project manager for the ship, said at the ship's bridge, which will be removed when the vessel is running at full automation.
The ship will load and offload its cargo, recharge its batteries and also navigate without human involvement.
Sensors will be able to quickly detect and understand objects like kayaks in the water so the ship can decide what action to take to avoid hitting anything, Braaten said.
The system should be an improvement over having a manual system, he added.
""We've taken away the human element, which today is also the cause of many of the accidents we see,"" Braaten said.
The ship, which will do two journeys per week to start with,  has capacity to ship 120 20-foot containers of fertiliser at a time.
It is powered by batteries provided by Swiss Leclanche packing 7 megawatt hours over eight battery rooms, the equivalent of 100 Tesla cars, Braaten said.",0
87,"BOGOTA Nov 23 (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday he celebrates the advances made to implement Colombia's 2016 peace deal with the demobilized FARC rebels, but added efforts must be redoubled to sustain economic opportunities for ex-combatants.
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) signed a peace deal with the government in 2016, resulting in the demobilization of some 13,000 members, including 7,000 combatants.
The agreement ended the FARC's role in the Andean country's long-running internal conflict, which has left millions displaced and more than 260,000 dead.
While the Colombian government's measures to further the peace deal have seen progress, more state help is needed to ensure the survival of projects for ex-combatants, Guterres said during a trip to the country.
""We must redouble efforts to guarantee the sustainability of these projects, with financial and technical support, and land and housing,"" Guterres said while visiting a re-integration camp located in Colombia's Antioquia province, with President Ivan Duque
Duque welcomed Guterres' visit as historic, which ""will allow us to see the implementation of Peace with Legality and other programs.""
The accord has been beset with challenges, with several former commanders - who argued the deal was not being fulfilled - returning to arms, while close to 300 ex-FARC have been killed since the deal was signed, according to local advocacy group Indepaz.

88,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has become the world's ""most effective"" human rights organization over its leadership on the Peng Shuai case and willingness to lose money to stand by its principles, said Kelley Eckels Currie, former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues.
The whereabouts of Peng, a former tennis doubles world number one, became a matter of international concern for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that a former top Chinese government official had sexually assaulted her. She re-appeared over the weekend in Beijing.
The WTA, the main organizational body for women's tennis internationally, has called for a transparent investigation and assurances about Peng's safety and well-being, and has threatened to pull out of tournaments in China over the matter.
""If you had told me a week-and-a-half ago that the Women's Tennis Association was going to be the most effective and bravest human rights organization in the world I would have thought you were bananas but here we are,"" Currie told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
""The WTA is essentially putting more than a billion dollars on the line over the life of a single member of the Women's Tennis Association.""
In 25 years of working in human rights, she had never seen any group ""actually put something on the line like this for human rights,"" said Currie, the former U.S. Representative at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, nominated by then-President Donald Trump.
On Sunday, Peng held a video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, but the WTA has said this did not address or alleviate its concerns about her wellbeing.
The United States, France, Britain and prominent tennis players have all expressed concerns over Peng, a former Olympian.
It comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Games over China's human rights record.
""The tennis season goes all year,"" said Currie. ""As long as players continue to express concern for her and this continues to be an issue with the WTA and they continue to raise her case, it will continue to remain in some kind of spotlight.
""It will be an issue at the Olympics and before that the Australian Open, and then Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Every time tennis does something and has an audience she will be there.""",0
89,"DUBAI, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The number of displaced people in camps in Yemen's Marib province has risen nearly 10-fold since September, with over 45,000 people fleeing their homes as Houthi forces press an offensive, the U.N. migration agency IOM said on Wednesday.
Conditions at 137 displacement sites are poor and deteriorating, the IOM said, calling for more funding and warning of a larger exodus should fighting reach Marib city, the capital.
""We've not witnessed this much desperation in  Marib in the last two years as we have in the last two months,"" said IOM Yemen chief representative Christa Rottensteiner.
""Communities are being repeatedly displaced and arriving at our sites in dire need,"" Rottensteiner said, adding that up to 40 people sometimes share one small tent.
The Iran-aligned Houthis have advanced on most districts in energy-rich Marib, which is the internationally recognised government's last stronghold in the country's north.
Marib city is home to three million people, including nearly 1 million who fled other parts of Yemen after the Houthis ousted the government from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in the conflict.
""IOM is extremely concerned about the prospect that hundreds of thousands of people might be forced to move again if violence reaches the city, as well as rising civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure,"" said Rottensteiner.
The war has caused what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis. IOM said this year's $3.85 billion aid response plan is only 57% funded, and that the agency itself has received only half its requested $170 million.

90,"LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC) said on Wednesday the global platinum market would see a much larger surplus this year than it previously forecast and another big oversupply in 2022.
Platinum  is used by automakers to neutralise harmful engine emissions and by jewellers, industries such as glassmakers and for investment. Surpluses imply lower prices and deficits higher prices.
The WPIC, which was set up by platinum mining companies and uses data from consultants Metals Focus and SFA (Oxford), said the roughly 8 million tonne a year platinum market would be oversupplied by 769,000 ounces this year -- the most since its data begins in 2013 -- and 637,000 ounces in 2022.
In September, it predicted a surplus of 190,000 ounces in 2021. In May, it forecast a deficit. 
In the third quarter of this year alone, the platinum market was oversupplied by 592,000 ounces, the biggest quarterly surplus since at least 2013.
Supply from South Africa has increased as inventory that built up during a smelter outage is processed faster than expected, the WPIC said.
Meanwhile, demand from automakers fell as a chip shortage forced them to cut production and stockpiles held in exchange vaults in New York and for investors in exchange traded funds (ETFs) shrank.
The WPIC predicted platinum supply would remain high next year, but its head of research Trevor Raymond said production of the metal should fall in 2022 or 2023 after the built-up inventories in South Africa are spent.
The WPIC said next year it expected demand from automakers and investors in platinum bars and coins to rise but for  industry, ETFs and jewellers to want less platinum.
Platinum prices  rose to a 6-1/2 year high of $1,336.50 an ounce in February but have since sagged to around $1,000.

A subsidiary of Tokens.com, called the Metaverse Group, bought a patch of real estate for 618,000 MANA on Monday, which was around $2,428,740 at the time, a Decentraland spokesman and a statement by Tokens.com said.
Reuters also saw the land's purchase recorded on the NFT marketplace OpenSea.
Decentraland said it was the most expensive purchase of a plot of virtual real estate on the platform.
The land is in the ""Fashion Street"" area of Decentraland's map and Tokens.com said it would be used to host digital fashion events and sell virtual clothing for avatars.  read more 
It is made of 116 smaller parcels, measuring 52.5 square feet each, making the land 6,090 virtual square feet in size.
Andrew Kiguel, CEO of Tokens.com, said the assets would complement the real estate already held by Metaverse Group.
In June, a plot of virtual land in Decentraland sold for 1,295,000 MANA, worth $913,228 at the time. The buyers built a virtual shopping centre to sell digital clothing, but Reuters has visited this site multiple times since and not seen any shoppers.  read more

94,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely expected to raise the official cash rate at Wednesday's meeting to counter rising inflation. The question for markets is whether the bank will deliver a 25-basis-point rate hike or opt for a bold 50 basis points  read more .
Refinitiv's  shows a hike is fully priced - with around a 33% chance the OCR will be raised to 1.00% from the current 0.50%.
The consensus among analysts is that the RBNZ will stick to a more traditional quarter-point hike due to lingering economic uncertainty associated with the coronavirus and the fact the market has already lifted term interest rates.
Yet New Zealand's often unpredictable central bank has surprised the market before and there is a solid case for a 50-basis-point increase. With inflation running hot and unemployment extremely low, there is a risk the economy will overheat.
Recent moves in the New Zealand dollar suggest the foreign exchange market is positioning for a smaller hike. The AUD/NZD is 0.75% higher than its Nov 18 low of 1.0326 and the NZD/USD is trading at a six-week low around 0.6950.
The risk is for the NZD to rise after the decision, as even if the RBNZ decides to ""only"" raise the cash rate by a quarter-point, its OCR forecast is likely to project an aggressive tightening cycle.
The favoured strategy is to sell AUD/NZD with a stop above the 100-day moving average at 1.0466, targeting the Sept 16 low at 1.0280.

95,"SYDNEY, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The dollar paused for breath on Wednesday after surging with bets on higher rates when Jerome Powell was picked for a second term as Federal Reserve chair, while the New Zealand dollar was on edge ahead of a central bank decision on a rate-hike path.
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira  has collapsed and fell more than 11% in one session overnight, setting the scene for further capital outflows and possibly putting pressure on EM currencies globally.
Among majors the market has steadied after the dollar's jump.
The kiwi  has been slipping ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meeting, which is the main focus of traders in the Asia session, even though a hike is expected and pricing suggests a 40% chance it is a big one -- 50 basis points.
""Although markets already price in some risk of a 50 bp hike, such a move would still see NZD gain as the implied risk of more 50 bp moves in the hiking cycle increases,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
""Conversely, a hawkish statement and higher forward guidance should limit the damage if RBNZ opts for the majority expectation of 25 bp.""
The New Zealand currency sat at $0.6951 ahead of the meeting, which is at 0100 GMT, after dropping overnight to a six-week low of $0.6917.
Elsewhere, moves were slight and the dollar clung to hefty gains made as aggressive shifts in rates markets and interest rate expectations flowed into currency trade.
The greenback touched a more-than-four-year high of 115.19 yen  on Tuesday as two-year Treasury yields  surged to their highest levels since March 2020 and Fed funds futures priced in as many as two rate hikes next year.

96,"TOKYO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday his government would release some oil reserves in response to a U.S. request in a way that does not breach a Japanese law that only allows stock releases if there is a risk of supply disruption.
""We have been working with the United States to stabilise the international oil market and we have decided to join the United States in selling part of our national oil reserves in a way that does not contravene existing (Japanese) oil reserve law,"" Kishida told reporters.
Kishida didn't say exactly how the stocks would be released. He said Industry Minister Koichi Hagiuda will announce details later on Wednesday, such as the amount to be sold, adding Japan would continue to lobby oil-producing countries to combat drastic price moves.
The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier that Japan will hold auctions for about 4.2 million barrels of oil out of an overall national stockpile of about 490 million barrels. The auctions for the crude oil, about one or two days' of Japan's national demand, will be held by the end of the year, the Nikkei said, without citing a source for the information.
Kishida's confirmation came after the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday it will release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, to try to cool rising crude prices after major global producers repeatedly ignored calls for more supply.  read more 
Under the coordinated plan, the United States will release 50 million barrels, the equivalent of about two and a half days of U.S. demand. India, meanwhile, said it would release 5 million barrels, while Britain said it would allow the voluntary release of 1.5 million barrels of oil from privately held reserves.
Details on the amount and timing of the release of oil from South Korea and China were not announced. Seoul said it would decide after discussions with the United States and other allies.  read more ",0
97,"(Reuters) - Maryland sued Bayer AG on Tuesday seeking money to clean up environmental contamination in the state's waterways the state says is due to toxic chemicals the company's Monsanto Co unit made decades ago.
In a complaint filed Tuesday in state court in Baltimore, the state said Monsanto, which Bayer acquired in 2018, knew as early as the 1930s that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were toxic and lingered in the environment but continued to produce and sell them.
By the time the chemicals were banned in 1979, they had contaminated the state's waterways, including the Susquehanna River, Baltimore Harbor and the Chesapeake Bay, as well as its fish and wildlife, the state said.
""Monsanto's toxic legacy lives on,"" Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement. ""Until today, Marylanders have borne the cost of cleaning up these poisons. It is time for Monsanto to take full responsibility.""
Bayer said in a statement that the lawsuit was without merit.
""Monsanto voluntarily ceased its lawful manufacturing of PCBs more than 40 years ago, and never manufactured, used, or disposed of PCBs into Maryland's lands or waters, and therefore should not be held liable for the contamination alleged by the state,"" it said.
Bayer has faced numerous lawsuits over PCBs, including a class action led by local governments including Los Angeles County and the cities of San Diego, Baltimore and Portland, Oregon. The company maintained that the plaintiffs could not show a direct causal link between Monsanto's conduct and any damages, but in June 2020 agreed to settle the case for $648 million without admitting wrongdoing.
A federal judge in November 2020 rejected that deal, finding that it appeared overly broad in shielding Bayer from future claims. The company has said it expects a modified version of the settlement addressing those concerns to be approved.
The company is also facing nearly 200 claims by people who say they were harmed by Monsanto-made PCBs at a Washington state school. The two trials in that litigation have resulted in verdicts of $185 million and $62 million.
PCBs were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and were also used in such products as carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. They were outlawed by the U.S. government in 1979 after being linked to cancer and other health problems. Monsanto produced PCBs from 1935 to 1977.
The case is State of Maryland v. Monsanto Co, Circuit Court for Baltimore City.
For Maryland: Assistant Attorney General Adam Snyder; Ari Casper of The Casper Firm; Amy Williams-Derry of Keller Rohrback; and Keith Ketterling of Stoll Berne

98,"(Reuters) - A conservative judge appointed by former Republican President Donald Trump to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday blasted its immigration rulings as ""perpetually embarrassing"" as he objected to giving two Indonesians another shot at winning asylum.
U.S. Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke's comments came in a dissent to a 2-1 decision holding the Board of Immigration Appeals failed to assess the risk the couple faced of persecution in majority-Muslim Indonesia given their status as evangelical Christians.
VanDyke, who has become known for stringent dissents since joining the liberal-leaning court in 2020, said he was often ""baffled why my colleagues strain to prevent removal in some of the cases that come before us.""
That was particularly so when the individuals had ""disturbing"" criminal histories, VanDyke said, citing other recent cases.
He said by contrast, ""it's easy to see why one would want to help"" the two Indonesians in California, Henri Nababan and Harlena Rose Silalahi. But ""following the law and not your heart"" is the hard part of judging, he said in arguing BIA's decision should stand.
""The majority's unwarranted reversal in this case is the latest specimen of our playing BIA-for-a-day instead of genuinely deferring to the agency's decisions,"" VanDyke wrote.
Howard Davis, a Glendale, California-based lawyer for Nababan and Silalahi, and the U.S. Justice Department, which oversees the BIA, did not respond to requests for comment.
The decision was the latest development in years of asylum proceedings beginning in 2003. Nababan and Silalahi, married Seventh Day Adventist Church members, remained in the United States without permission after entering the country on temporary visas.
The appeal stemmed from the BIA's 2018 rejection of their request to reopen their case based on changed conditions in Indonesia.
They cited an ""eruption"" of attacks against Christians starting in 2016 and said their recently attained church leadership positions as deacons exposed them to heightened danger.
U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason of Alaska, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama who sat by designation, said the BIA failed to fully assess the risk of persecution they faced specifically as evangelical Christians.
VanDyke in his dissent argued the BIA had considered their status as Christians generally and no evidence supported finding evangelicals were treated differently.
Gleason disagreed, citing affidavits from experts, a letter from Silalahi's father saying he had been attacked and the blasphemy prosecution of a Christian politician.
She was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Paez, an appointee of former Democratic President Bill Clinton.
The case is Nababan v. Garland, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-72548.

102,"MELBOURNE, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Australia's Viva Energy Group (VEA.AX) said on Wednesday it aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from all its non-refining operations by 2030 and committed to a 10% reduction in emissions intensity from its Geelong refinery by the end of the decade.
Viva operates the Geelong refinery in Victoria, one of two remaining oil refineries in Australia, and is the biggest branded retail fuel supplier through its Shell Coles Express petrol stations.
The fuel supplier said in a strategy briefing that it was targeting net zero on all direct and indirect emissions, otherwise called scope 1 and 2, across its non-refining businesses by 2030, and at all its operations by 2050.
The company aims to expand its annual operating earnings by more than A$50 million ($36.11 million) over the next three to five years through new businesses.
Among those opportunities, Viva is looking to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at the Geelong site, which could help fill a looming gas supply shortfall in southeast Australia from the mid-2020s.
It plans to submit its environmental effects statement to Victoria state regulators by the end of December, with a state ruling expected by June, and aims to make a final investment decision in the third quarter of 2022.
Australia's energy market operator has warned that Victoria faces a gas supply shortfall from 2024 unless an LNG import terminal is built.
""Our view is that gas short is coming on and our project is the best-placed to supply that replacement gas,"" Viva's chief business development officer Lachlan Pfeiffer told analysts at a strategy briefing.
Viva's proposed terminal is closest to where the market need will be - Victoria's capital Melbourne, he said.
Viva is racing against Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest's Squadron Energy to build the first LNG import terminal. Squadron's project is in Port Kembla, in neighbouring New South Wales state.

103,"A New York real estate lawyer who has been accused by creditors of misusing client funds has reached a plea agreement with prosecutors and will surrender for arrest next month, the Manhattan district attorney's office told a federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday.
In a letter to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones, prosecutors said they expect attorney Mitchell Kossoff to surrender on or about Dec. 3 and to enter a guilty plea a week later. The letter did not specify the criminal charges or include details about Kossoff's plea.
Kossoff PLLC was forced into bankruptcy in May after creditors claimed Kossoff, once a fixture in the New York real estate scene, misappropriated more than $8 million from the law firm's escrow accounts.
A lawyer for Kossoff, Walter Mack, declined to comment. Mack has said Kossoff would cooperate in the bankruptcy proceedings if he is granted immunity from prosecution. Kossoff has not responded directly to his creditors' claims in bankruptcy court.
A representative for District Attorney Cyrus Vance's office declined to comment.
The DA's letter asked Jones to extend its deadline to respond to Al Togut, the Chapter 7 trustee overseeing the dissolution of Kossoff PLLC. Togut is seeking grand jury materials relating to prosecutors' investigation of Kossoff and asked Jones to force the district attorney to turn them over.
Once Kossoff has entered his guilty plea, the grand jury's investigation will be complete, rendering the dispute moot, prosecutors said. The office will seek a court order allowing materials to be shared with Togut, the letter added.
""We believe that allowing the criminal process to take its course will be the most efficient means of resolving these issues and will avoid unnecessary expenditure of resources,"" prosecutors said.
Togut has struggled for months to obtain documents he says he needs to administer the defunct law firm's estate. Togut said in an email Tuesday that he is still frustrated that he does not have access to the records prosecutors seized.
On Monday, Jones warned that he would issue a bench warrant for Kossoff's arrest if he did not comply with orders to turn over key documents to Togut by Nov. 30.

105,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - A federal jury on Tuesday found that pharmacy chain operators CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) helped fuel an opioid epidemic in two Ohio counties, in the first trial the companies have faced over the U.S. drug crisis.
Jurors in Cleveland federal court after six days of deliberations concluded that actions by the pharmacy chains helped create a public nuisance that resulted in an oversupply of addictive pain pills and the diversion of those opioids to the black market.
Mark Lanier, a lawyer for Ohio's Lake and Trumbull counties, called the verdict a ""landmark decision"" that paved the way for them to each seek more than $1 billion from the companies to help address the deadly epidemic's toll in their communities.
U.S. District Judge Dan Polster will decide how much the companies owe to abate the epidemic in the counties and is expected to hold a trial on that question in April or May.
The verdict bolstered efforts by state and local governments to negotiate settlements resolving thousands of other cases against the pharmacy chains. Joe Rice, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he looked forward to discussing potential settlements.
""You can be sure the message from this jury is going to be talked about in the boardrooms of every corporation involved in the pharmaceutical chain that's involved in this litigation,"" he said.
Stock prices for the companies briefly fell after the verdict but quickly rebounded and closed up less than 1%.
CVS, Walgreens and Walmart said they would appeal the verdict, arguing it ran contrary to the facts and that it misapplied public nuisance law to hold them liable under a novel legal theory that courts in California and Oklahoma have recently rejected in similar cases against drugmakers.
""We will appeal this flawed verdict, which is a reflection of a trial that was engineered to favor the plaintiffs' attorneys and was riddled with remarkable legal and factual mistakes,"" Walmart said.
U.S. officials have said that by 2019, the health crisis led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
Over 100,000 people died from drug overdoses during the 12-month period ending April 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report last week, a record driven in large part by deaths from opioids like fentanyl. read more

The three largest U.S. distributors that supply pharmacies and hospitals - McKesson Corp (MCK.N), Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) - and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in July proposed paying up to $26 billion to settle most of the lawsuits against them.  read more 
A bankruptcy judge in September approved a settlement by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners that the company values at more than $10 billion.
The pharmacies, however, went to trial despite the urging of the judge to settle.
At trial, lawyers for Lake and Trumbull counties argued that the pharmacies failed to ensure opioid prescriptions were valid and allowed excessive quantities of addictive pain pills to flood their communities.
The pharmacy operators denied the allegations. They said they took steps to guard against diversion of pills and blamed others, including doctors, regulators and drug traffickers, for the epidemic.
The verdict followed recent setbacks for plaintiffs pursuing some of the other opioid cases nationally.

106,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Chelsea claimed a thumping 4-0 victory over Juventus thanks to goals from home-grown trio Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi and a fourth by Timo Werner to top Champions League Group H and cruise into the knockout stage.
European champions Chelsea took control from the outset and never relaxed as they booked their place in the last 16.
Defender Chalobah, 22, smacked the ball into the net past the flailing arms of Wojciech Szczesny in the 25th minute after centre back Toni Rudiger set him up from a Hakim Ziyech corner.
A VAR check dismissed calls for handball against Rudiger when replays showed the ball hit his hand in front of his chest.
James, 21, showed superb technique to angle a shot into the left hand corner of the goal in the 55th and barely three minutes later 21-year-old Hudson-Odoi scored from a layoff by another Academy graduate Ruben Loftus-Cheek.
Juventus had already qualified for the knockout stage but the result dropped them to second place in the group, level with Chelsea on 12 points, with one round of fixtures to play.
Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel was full of praise for his young scorers.
""It’s their biggest dream to perform at Stamford Bridge, to perform in blue, to be part of a strong Chelsea team,"" the German said. ""I strongly believe this is a huge part of the success that we have this mix.""
Werner put the icing on the cake before the final whistle by sending the ball home from a Ziyech cross.
Chelsea, beaten 1-0 in Turin in September, made the Italians look ordinary, running them ragged with intricate passing movements and producing 20 shots on goal to Juve's eight.
Former Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata had the visitors' best chance when he chipped the ball over advancing Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy in the 28th minute, but 37-year-old defender Thiago Silva raced back to superbly hook the ball off the line.
Mendy pulled off a save of his own late in the second half, tipping the ball over the bar from a Weston McKennie shot.
Szczesny saved Juventus from utter humiliation with a series of fine stops, pushing the ball round the post from efforts by Hudson-Odoi and James as well as keeping out Ziyech and Ben Chilwell.
The one downside for the hosts was an injury to wing-back Chilwell, who appeared to twist his knee and was helped off the pitch.",0
107,"(Reuters) - The McGill rule has struck again.
U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam of Oakland on Monday refused to compel arbitration of California state-law claims by a class of consumers who allege that StubHub Inc wrongfully changed its cash refund policies when COVID-19 forced widespread event cancellations. StubHub’s terms of service include a provision requiring individual arbitration of consumer claims, but Gilliam ruled that the company cannot enforce the provision for claims under California law because of state supreme court precedent from 2017’s McGill v. Citibank NA.
The California justices held in McGill that the Federal Arbitration Act does not pre-empt state laws that allow plaintiffs to seek a public injunction to “prohibit unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public.” The 9th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently endorsed the so-called McGill rule in 2019’s Blair v. Rent-A-Center Inc. In combination, the two rulings mean that if corporations try to impose arbitration provisions that effectively bar public injunctive relief, courts will find them invalid.
The StubHub case is a good example of how McGill has empowered plaintiffs to push for class litigation. It also shows  why the California precedent is so bitterly despised by corporate defendants that are now hoping for help from the U.S. Supreme Court.
Class counsel in the StubHub litigation, Ahdoot & Wolfson and Wittels McInturff Palikovic, alleged, among other things, that StubHub continued to tout its FanProtect guarantee of full cash refunds for cancelled events even after it stopped paying cash refunds to all customers. The class complaint sought a public injunction to require StubHub to honor the full cash refund policy or to conduct an advertising campaign to notify consumers that it is not actually promising full refunds to all customers.
StubHub’s lawyers at McDermott Will & Emery said the supposed injunction claim was not at all what it seemed. Plaintiffs weren’t really after an injunction to protect the general public from future injury, the company argued in its motion to compel arbitration. Class counsel merely threw those words into their complaint, in “a thinly veiled maneuver to try to avoid arbitration.”
The company contended that this case is, in fact, a series of private contract disputes between StubHub and dissatisfied customers. Those disputes, the motion said, are governed by the arbitration provision in StubHub’s user agreements – and the judge should not allow class counsel to get away with artfully drafting their complaint to invoke the McGill rule as a tactic to evade individual arbitration. StubHub cited a 2020 ruling by U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer of Los Angeles, who granted the company’s motion to compel arbitration in a refund class action by people who bought tickets to cancelled Major League Baseball games because plaintiffs’ public injunction claim actually would have conferred no public benefit.
“McGill does not apply where individuals seek monetary relief disguised as a public injunction,” StubHub said.
StubHub’s arguments to Gilliam echoed assertions from lots of other corporate defendants over the last few years. In 2020, I told you about U.S. Supreme Court petitions from Comcast Corp and AT&T Mobility LLC that characterized the McGill rule as a mistake that had enabled consumers to weasel out of arbitration. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the rule “a road map marked with an easy-to-follow path” in amicus briefs urging the Supreme Court to come to defendants’ rescue.
The Supreme Court denied the two petitions last year, but the issue is once again before the justices, this time in a petition by Fast Auto Loans Inc. (Another petition challenging the McGill rule was filed by HRB Tax Group Inc, but the company since asked the Supreme Court to delay action pending developments in the underlying California litigation.) Fast Auto told the justices that in the wake of McGill, California courts have adopted such a loose definition for a “public injunction” that hundreds of companies are now facing non-arbitrable claims, subverting the whole point of their mandatory arbitration agreements with consumers.
The corporate pushback has not escaped the attention of the 9th Circuit. Broadly speaking, the court has stuck by its Rent-A-Center holding that the Federal Arbitration Act does not pre-empt the McGill rule, as consumer advocates from Gupta Wessler told the Supreme Court in a brief opposing review in the Fast Auto case. But the circuit court has tightened the definition of a public injunction. Most recently, a divided panel in Hodges v. Comcast Cable Communications LLC ruled that the McGill rule applies only “to forward-looking injunctions that seek to prevent future violations of law for the benefit of the general public as a whole.”
Class counsel in the StubHub MDL said in their brief opposing arbitration that their injunction claim is exactly that: a necessary means to block StubHub from continuing to deceive the public about its refund policy.
Gilliam agreed in Monday’s ruling. The California Supreme Court’s McGill decision, he said, addressed a public injunction claim quite similar to the claim against StubHub, calling for a prohibition on allegedly deceptive advertising. Precluding StubHub from allegedly “misrepresenting to the general public the protections afforded by its FanProtect Guarantee,” Gilliam said, is “a paradigmatic example of public injunctive relief.”
Even if StubHub is right and plaintiffs asserted the injunction claim specifically to evade arbitration through the McGill rule, the judge said, “their motivation for doing so is simply irrelevant to the inquiry.”
StubHub counsel William Donovan and Daniel Campbell of McDermott did not respond to my query on Gilliam’s ruling. Nor did class counsel Tina Wolfson of Ahdoot Wolfson and Tiasha Palikovic of Wittels.
The U.S. Supreme Court hasn’t set a conference date on the Fast Auto petition for certiorari, even though briefing in the case is complete. I told you last week that the court is also delaying without explanation a conference on a petition to review California precedent allowing plaintiffs to evade arbitration of claims under the state’s Private Attorney General Act.
California seems, at the moment, to be confounding the high court.

Crowell had represented Walgreens in 2008 on a prescription drug-savings program that is central to the arbitration.
The firm is now also counsel to major national health insurers in a case in Illinois federal court against Walgreens.
Crowell has denied violating any ethics rules.
The Superior Court case is a rare example of a major U.S. company alleging a big law firm crossed an ethical line based on prior client work.
Walgreens said in its new filing ""Crowell ignored the duty it owed Walgreens, its former client, by acting adversely to Walgreens in matters that were substantially related to Crowell's prior representation of Walgreens.""
The firm said internal records are necessary as part of the company's assessment of damages. Walgreens is seeking, among other things, an order that would require Crowell to return certain legal fees for cases where the firm had lined up against the company.
Crowell has asserted attorney-client and work-product shields should stop Walgreens from acquiring internal records involving other clients.
Lawyers for Crowell have said Walgreens' demands for records on other health clients is ""irrelevant and overbroad — the proverbial discovery 'fishing expedition.'""
Crowell's lawyers at Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis and attorneys for Walgreens did not immediately return messages on Tuesday seeking comment.
The case is Walgreen Co v. Crowell & Moring, Superior Court of the District of Columbia, No. 2021-0861
For Walgreens: Frederick Robinson of Reed Smith; and Courtney Forrest of KaiserDillon
For Crowell: Thomas Mason and Jared Marx of Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis

109,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Wilmington, Delaware on Tuesday dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit that accused a subsidiary of specialty chemicals maker Croda International Plc of knowingly risking people's health from exposure to a carcinogenic chemical.
U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas agreed with Croda's lawyers that ""the mere risk of disease alone is not a compensable tort injury"" under Delaware law. Bibas, a 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge who sat by designation to handle the federal district court case, said the plaintiff can file an amended complaint.
The lawsuit was brought by Catherine Baker of New Castle, Delaware, where Croda Inc operates its Atlas Point manufacturing plant. The plant in 2018 leaked thousands of pounds of ethylene oxide, a carcinogen, into a surrounding neighborhood, her complaint alleges. Croda says that following the leak, it sprayed water to quickly dissolve the chemical.
The substance is an odorless and colorless gas that the Environmental Protection Agency classifies as a hazardous air pollutant because long-term exposure can increase the risks of cancer of the white blood cells and breast cancer. It is used to make chemicals that allow the manufacturing of products including antifreeze and detergents.
Baker in her complaint said residents' exposure to large amounts of ethylene oxide put them at increased risk of falling ill to cancer.
In his ruling, Bibas said that while a few states recognize an increased risk of disease as a legal injury, Delaware does not.
He rejected Baker's argument that New Jersey law should apply because Croda Inc is headquartered there.
Baker's lawsuit would have stood a better chance in New Jersey, where state law allows claims over increased risks of disease if the plaintiffs are ""more likely than not"" to develop a disease, the ruling said.
Croda declined to comment. Attorneys representing Baker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The case is Baker v. Croda Inc, the U.S. District Court of the District of Delaware, No. 1:20-cv-01108.
For Baker: Kimberly Evans and Kyle McGee of Grant & Eisenhofer
For Croda Inc: Kenneth Nachbar and Miranda Gilbert of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell

110,"BERN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Atalanta's Luis Muriel came off the bench to equalise two minutes from time and snatch a 3-3 draw at Young Boys Berne in a frenetic finish to their Champions League clash on Tuesday.
The Italians had been 2-1 up with 10 minutes remaining and looking to move into second place in Group F before the Swiss rallied with two goals in a four-minute spell to go ahead.
But Muriel’s 88th minute strike kept Atalanta in the race for a top two finish and a knockout stage berth - effectively needing to beat Villarreal in their last group game on Dec. 8.
Manchester United lead the group with 10 points, three ahead of Villarreal with Atalanta on six and Young Boys on four.
Atalanta had taken an early lead as Duvan Zapata kept up his goalscoring form, being allowed by the home defence to turn and shoot from close range in the 10th minute.
But Young Boys, who are now out of the Champions League reckoning, fought back to equalise with a 39th minute header from the imposing American international Jordan Pefok.
Atalanta's defender Jose Luis Palomino then hammered home a left footed shot from the edge of the penalty area six minutes into the second half to restore their lead only for the Italian club to implode as the game entered the final 10 minutes.
First substitute Vincent Sierro and then fullback Silvan Hefti scored as Young Boys were suddenly catapulted back into contention before being condemned back to last place in the group standings by Muriel’s late equaliser.",0
111,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it had approved Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's (4502.T) drug for a common type of viral infection occurring in patients after organ transplant.
The infection is caused by a type of herpes virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) and can have a major negative impact on transplant recipients, including loss of the transplanted organ as well as death.
The FDA said it approved Takeda's drug Livtencity for use against CMV disease among patients who do not respond to available antiviral treatments.
""Cytomegalovirus infections that are resistant or do not respond to available drugs are of even greater concern,"" FDA official John Farley said.
""Today's approval helps meet a significant unmet medical need by providing a treatment option for this patient population.""
Livtencity works by preventing the activity of an enzyme involved in virus replication. The drug will be commercially available soon, Takeda said.
CMV is one of the most common infections experienced by transplant recipients, with an estimated incidence rate of around 16%–56% in solid organ transplant recipients, the company said.",0
112,"MALMO, Sweden, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A last-gasp penalty by Yaroslav Rakitskiy earned 10-man Zenit St Petersburg a 1-1 draw at Malmo FF in their Champions League Group H clash on Tuesday, ensuring that the Russians will play in the Europa League in the New Year.
Danish midfielder Soren Rieks netted Malmo's first goal of the group stage in the 28th minute, combining well with Veljko Birmancevic before firing a shot low to the keeper's left to give his side the lead.
Zenit missed a gilt-edged chance to equalise from the penalty spot early in the second half, and the visitors also  had Dmitri Chistyakov sent off for a second yellow card in the 86th minute.
The drama was not over though and Rieks was adjudged to have fouled Artem Dzubya in the box in second-half stoppage time, with Rakitskiy making no mistake from the spot.
The result ensured Zenit, who have four points, cannot finish lower than third in the group behind Chelsea and Juventus, who both have 12 points. Malmo have one point but lost away to Zenit and have a much poorer goal difference.",0
113,"SEVILLE, Spain, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Joan Jordan scored an early goal as Sevilla beat Wolfsburg 2-0 in their Champions League clash at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Tuesday, a result that means all four sides in Group G remain in contention for the knockout round.
Substitute Rafa Mir added a second goal deep into injury-time as Sevilla secured a first victory in the group phase this season and it was just about deserved in a match of few clear-cut chances, with Wolfsburg in particular offering little in attack.
Lille lead the table with one round to play having amassed eight points from their five games, ahead of RB Salzburg (seven points), Sevilla (six) and Wolfsburg (five). Sevilla travel to Salzburg for their final game on Dec. 8, while Wolfsburg host Lille at the same time.
The home side’s bright start was rewarded with a goal as Jordan stooped to head in an inviting cross from Ivan Rakitic after 13 minutes for his first Champions League strike.
Wolfsburg went close to an equaliser midway through the first half when Lukas Nmecha’s shot was palmed onto the crossbar by home goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, but the latter barely had a save to make after that.
Mir had a simple finish from six yards to add a second for the hosts, who inflicted a first defeat on new Wolfsburg coach Florian Kohfeldt. He replaced Mark van Bommel last month and won his first three games in charge before drawing at the weekend.",0
114,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday the vast majority of Americans who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 should receive a booster shot, and that an additional dose could eventually become the country's standard for determining who is fully vaccinated.
Fauci and other disease experts have said they expect that COVID-19 will transition this spring from a pandemic phase in the United States to an endemic disease, meaning that the virus will continue to circulate at a lower level, causing smaller, less disruptive but still significant outbreaks in the coming years.  read more 
But some are expressing new concern over a rise in U.S. infections in recent weeks, a trend that is likely to accelerate as more Americans travel and gather for U.S. Thanksgiving this week and other upcoming holidays.
""We'd like to get as many people who were originally vaccinated with the first regimen boosted,"" Fauci said in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Next conference.
Asked to quantify, he said, the ""overwhelming majority"" of Americans who have been fully vaccinated should now receive a COVID-19 booster shot based on data showing they provide ""substantial"" protection beyond what is seen from the original inoculation.
To date, about 33 million Americans have received a booster dose. The government recently expanded eligibility for an additional shot to all U.S. adults.  read more 
Studies from Israel and other countries have shown that vaccine protection wanes over time. While data first suggested that was mostly a problem in the elderly, there is newer evidence that it occurs among all age groups, Fauci said.
""That's the reason why we're very keen on getting as many people who are originally vaccinated to get a booster ... because they really do work,"" he said.
As experience with COVID-19 vaccines grows, it is conceivable that the definition of a ""full and complete regimen"" in the United States would comprise three doses of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech  and Moderna (MRNA.O) and two doses of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine, he said, similar to what some other countries have done.
""Right now, officially, fully vaccinated equals two shots of the mRNA and one shot of the J&J, but without a doubt that could change,"" he said. ""That's on the table for discussion.""
As for the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, which started with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine earlier this month, Fauci said there is no sign of any new safety issues. ""There is no signal at all,"" Fauci said.
At least 10% of the 28 million eligible children have gotten a first dose, Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus coordinator, said on Monday.
Fauci said people need to realize that no vaccine is completely without side effects. But when you consider the risks of COVID-19 compared to the very rare risk of an adverse event in a child, ""overwhelmingly ... the benefit far, far outweighs the risk.""
Asked whether he might consider retiring any time soon, the 80-year-old immunologist who heads the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, ""I'm not even remotely contemplating that right now.""
Fauci said he still wants to see the end of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and he also wants to see progress on ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to which he has devoted much of his career.
""There's a lot of unfinished business right now, so I'm not even thinking about walking away.""

115,"BARCELONA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Benfica held Barcelona to a scoreless draw in the Champions League at the Camp Nou on Tuesday night, meaning the second team to qualify for the Round of 16 from Group E behind Bayern Munich will be decided in the final game of the group stage.
Barca are two points ahead of Benfica with one game still to play, but they face a daunting task in the last group when they travel to Germany to take on Bayern, who have a perfect winning record so far. Benfica, meanwhile, host winless Dinamo Kyiv at home in Lisbon in their final game.
Benfica's manager had said on Monday that ""a draw would be worse for Barcelona"" and he was true to his word. Benfica defended stoically, closing down attacks with a solid five-man defensive line, leaving Barcelona in control of the ball much of the time - but far away from their goal.
For Barca, however, the match was another disappointing struggle, and they now have just two goals to their name in five games in the group stage of the competition.
Barca defender Ronald Araujo put it simply to reporters afterwards: ""We had a great game, the attitude was good, we defended well - it was only the goal that was missing. We still have the last game. It’s complicated but not impossible against Bayern.""
Barcelona’s first challenge of the day showed up hours before the game, when a storm hit the city, bringing heavy rain with it, but that didn't put off 49,572 fans from making it to the Camp Nou.
While new manager Xavi appeared to have quickly fixed many issues like the team’s intensity, rhythm, ball control and collective effort, scoring remains a problem.
Barca had 61% of the ball but created only a few chances, including a shot across goal from Yusuf Demir in the first half, a header from Frenkie de Jong after the break, and a volley from Araujo that went in only to be disallowed because he was in an offside position.
Benfica had their opportunities too, but Barca keeper Marc Andre ter Stegen kept out a header from Roman Yaremchuk, while Haris Seferovic failed to score what looked like the winner when through on goal in a stoppage-time counterattack, infuriating his coach.
""In my 30 years as a coach, I have never seen a player miss an opportunity like this. Unfortunately, it happened to us,"" Jorge Jesus told reporters.",0

117,"(Reuters) - When Miranda Devlin’s identity fraud scheme first began to unravel in late 2019, she insisted she was a legitimate criminal defense lawyer.
“I can swear on a stack of Bibles that I have taken the bar exam, I have passed the bar exam,” she told a local California newspaper, the Marin Independent Journal, after her arrest at the county courthouse.
To her credit, that was actually true – not that it seemed to make much difference last week when Devlin, 37, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for fraud by U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco.
Passing the bar exam alone doesn’t make you a lawyer. Would-be attorneys must also be deemed fit on moral character grounds.
For most people, it's a formality. Less than 1% of California state bar applicants are denied admission each year for failing the fitness and character assessment, a bar spokesman told me.
Devlin, who passed the Golden State’s notoriously difficult bar exam in 2013, was one of the few to be rejected on moral grounds.
According to court papers, she had prior theft and fraud-related convictions in state court, including a felony about 10 years before she finished her legal training via the Law Office Study Program, a California apprenticeship-based alternative to law school, under the supervision of her then-husband in 2010.
Deemed unfit by the bar, Devlin practiced law without a license, admitting in court papers to stealing the identities – and in one case, even paying the bar dues for – two other lawyers who shared her first name Miranda. Her clients included two men facing child molestation charges and one found guilty of attempted rape, according to the Marin Independent Journal.
It’s not clear what will happen in the cases where she was counsel of record, nor how many matters she handled. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California did not respond to a request for comment.
Devlin pleaded guilty to mail fraud (she submitted an online change-of-address form for one of the Mirandas so that her bar card would forward to Devlin), as well as fraudulently obtaining a $32,700 paycheck protection program loan in one of the other Miranda's name. She was also ordered to pay $565,355 in restitution.
“Ms. Devlin has no valid excuse to offer the court for her criminal conduct. She made terrible decisions that caused serious harm to many persons and entities,” her lawyer, San Francisco solo Mark Goldrosen, wrote in her sentencing memorandum. He also noted that she has started mental health counseling and is a devoted mother to four daughters, ages 16, 15, 9 and 5.
Devlin, who is in custody, could not be reached for comment. Goldrosen did not respond to a request for comment.
The case has unfolded in my backyard. The courthouse in San Rafael, California where a sharp-eyed superior court judge noticed a discrepancy in Devlin’s bar number is just eight miles away from my home.
But the questions it raises are broader. Are moral character and fitness rules for bar admission fair? Do they in fact serve to make the legal profession more upstanding?
In some ways, Devlin is a poster child for why state bars should perform such a gate-keeping function. Her application was rejected on moral character grounds and then look: She went on to get busted for fraud. You might say the bar examiners called it.
On the other hand, it’s not as if the rest of the legal profession is comprised entirely of angels.
According to the most recent report by the American Bar Association, more than 5,000 lawyers in 2019 were subject to some form of public discipline or sanctions, and another 5,000 were privately admonished. My Reuters colleagues regularly chronicle lawyers accused of malfeasance.
Clearly, the character and fitness requirement fails to weed out all the bad apples. But it also raises some basic questions: Do prior misdeeds accurately predict future transgressions? Is someone’s character set in stone, or does it evolve based on circumstances?
Moreover, the character requirement has the potential to adversely impact certain groups. For example, the U.S. Justice Department in 2014 entered into a settlement with the Louisiana Supreme Court for denying bar admission based on ""mental health diagnosis and treatment rather than conduct that would warrant denial of admission to the bar,"" a potential violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
I asked Amy Nuñez, the director of the State Bar of California’s Office of Admissions, how her organization approaches the task of evaluating character and why it’s a worthy exercise.
“Lawyers occupy a unique position of power and trust with clients, may have access to significant funds that are due to clients and are considered officers of the court,” she said via email. “It is important that bars assess, based on the available information at the time, whether there are any issues that suggest a potential lawyer may not be fit to meet these responsibilities.”
Every bar association in the country conducts character reviews, Nuñez said, noting that California in 2020 published revised guidelines for its moral character determinations with the aim of providing greater uniformity, consistency and transparency.
The goal is to “ensure that the State Bar gives appropriate consideration for rehabilitative efforts undertaken by applicants,” she said.
To its credit, the bar seems to have been prescient in denying admission to Devlin. Still, I also can’t help but think that if she’d been admitted in her own right, perhaps she wouldn’t have felt compelled to steal the identities of licensed lawyers in the first place.

118,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's historic move to release oil from strategic reserves in coordination with big nations including China represents a unique bet that finding common ground with the United States' biggest economic rival can help dampen fuel prices for middle class Americans.
The move, announced by the U.S. on Tuesday, underscores the complicated relationship Biden is trying to craft with China as he seeks agreement on key issues like climate change and trade, while linked in an economic arms race. The rare moment of cooperation comes as inflation, and especially high gasoline prices, eat at Biden's popularity at home.
""This is a new era of oil diplomacy for the U.S. to coordinate with India and China"" said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and the vice chairman of IHS Markit. Cooperation with China is likely to stick to energy and environment.
""Climate and energy are in a separate category from all the tough issues that need to be dealt with between the two countries,"" Yergin said.
The Biden administration's diplomatic inroads with China first surfaced in Glasgow, Scotland this month where the two countries hammered out a surprise deal on boosting action on climate change including reducing emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
""Glasgow showed that there is some level of common interest and diplomacy that can be successful between the United States and China,"" said Amy Myers Jaffee, a research professor at Tufts University and expert on global energy markets and climate.
Jaffee said both countries recognized the importance of a global climate agreement. ""I would say 'Ditto' on the oil market,"" Jaffee said.
Washington has stark differences with Beijing on trade issues and human rights concerns related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan. But the world's top two economies would benefit from energy cooperation given their adversarial relations with Saudi Arabia and Russia in terms of keeping oil prices low for consumers.
Combined, the United States and China consume nearly 35 million barrels of oil a day, more than a third of global demand. Even though the United States has become one of the world's largest oil producers, it is still the second-largest importer of crude, trailing only China.
China now imports more than 10 million barrels of oil a day, The United States imports about 6 million barrels per day, though in recent years it has sharply reduced its dependency on OPEC producers, with most of its imports now from Canada.
While China did not announce an oil tap on Tuesday, Biden spoke earlier with China's President Xi Jinping about opening their reserves and Chinese officials said on Nov. 18 they are working on a release. China held the first ever release of oil from its reserve in September, which aimed to stabilize prices.
The broader group of countries that have elected to work with the United States and release oil from their reserves include other large importers, including India, Japan and South Korea, which rank third, fourth and fifth, respectively.
U.S. oil prices hit a seven-year high in late October driving inflation and hitting Biden's approval rating ahead of midterm elections next year. With razor thin majorities in both chambers of Congress, Biden's fellow Democrats can ill afford to lose seats in 2022.
REPEAT DEAL TRICKY
Biden could take additional action in coordinating with other countries to maintain supply as the COVID-19 pandemic eases, the White House in a statement Tuesday.
Actually doing so may not be easy.
""Not only could U.S.-China tensions complicate further cooperation, but the U.S. stands apart from other strategic reserve holders in that its legislature has ordered the
selling off of strategic stockpiles"" to finance government programs, ClearView Energy Partners, a nonpartisan research group, said in a note to clients.
Some 18 million barrels of the U.S. release was simply a front-loading of required sales that were mandated by Congress in recent years.
There's a risk that consumer countries and producing countries could keep upping the ante with opposing announcements on global oil supplies, a prospect that would likely make oil prices even more volatile, or what Yergin calls a ""bloc versus bloc,"" scenario.
But in the short term, the action by consuming countries is likely to put pressure on oil prices, Yergin said.
""This also comes at a time when the supply/demand balance is on a course to improve over the next few months, and this oil deal will add to that. What it means at least for now is you’ll hear a lot fewer predictions about $100 oil.""",0
119,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A 19-year-old man has been arrested and charged with assault and other counts related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol for allegedly attacking police officers with bear spray and breaking through a U.S. Capitol window with a baseball bat, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.
A criminal complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., accused Aiden Bilyard of Cary, North Carolina, with seven riot-related criminal offenses, including felony charges of civil disorder and assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon.
Bilyard was arrested Monday in Raleigh, North Carolina, and released after an initial court appearance in federal court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Court records on Tuesday afternoon did not list a defense lawyer for Bilyard.
A mob of supporters of Republican former President Donald Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
According to a statement of facts by prosecutors, video shot by a Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police officer's body-worn camera on Jan. 6 shows Bilyard, wearing a gray Harvard sweatshirt and spraying a line of uniformed police outside the Capitol with an orange-colored liquid spray that investigators believe was bear spray.
Investigators said video taken later that day shows Bilyard with a group of rioters in front of a large Capitol window. After being handed a baseball bat by a fellow demonstrator, Bilyard shatters the window and ""then turns to face the crowd and appears to clap and shout"" to encourage rioters to enter the Capitol building.
Investigators said Bilyard then entered a Senate room through the broken window.
Nearly 700 people have been charged with participating in the Jan. 6 riot, and around 210 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers or employees during the attack.",0
120,"LILLE, France, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Jonathan David netted the only goal as Lille brushed aside their dismal domestic form to beat RB Salzburg 1-0 at home on Tuesday and take control of their Champions League group.
The French champions are without a win in five Ligue 1 games but took the lead in the 31st minute when prolific Canadian striker David finished from close range after a mazy dribble from strike partner Burak Yilmaz.
David is the top scorer in Ligue 1 with 10 goals and struck for the second Champions League game in a row after bagging a penalty in a 2-1 win at Sevilla earlier this month.
Lille top a tightly-poised Group G with eight points after five games while Salzburg are second with seven, Sevilla are third on six and Wolfsburg bottom with five, with all four teams still standing a chance of qualifying for the knockout stage.
Salzburg would have clinched their place in the last 16 with victory but now have to avoid defeat in their final game at home to Sevilla to advance. Lille visit Wolfsburg knowing a draw would be enough to go through.
While the Austrians are 15 points clear in their division, Lille are floundering this season after staging a huge shock last season in pipping Paris St Germain to lift a first domestic crown in a decade.
Jocelyn Gourvennec's side are 12th in Ligue 1, 20 points off leaders PSG and only four above the relegation zone.
They went into Tuesday's game reeling from throwing away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw with 10-man AS Monaco.
But against Salzburg they produced a gritty, disciplined performance, allowing the visitors most of the ball but limiting them to only half chances.
The closest the Austrians came to levelling in the second half was when Karim Adeyemi was felled right on the edge of the area by Lille's Tiago Djalo but they were denied a penalty, with a free kick inches away from the area awarded instead.",0

122,"(Reuters) - E-cigarette giant Juul Labs Inc has agreed to pay $14.5 million to settle a lawsuit by the state of Arizona accusing it of fueling a vaping epidemic by marketing its products to minors.
The settlement, announced Tuesday by the office of Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, provides for $12.5 million to be set aside for anti-addiction programs. The remaining $2 million will go to a general consumer protection fund and litigation expenses.
""Today's settlement holds Juul accountable for its irresponsible marketing efforts that pushed Arizona minors toward nicotine and the addiction that follows,"" Brnovich said in a statement.
Under pressure from regulators, Juul in 2018 pulled popular flavors such as mango and cucumber from retail store shelves and shut down its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook. The company on Tuesday said it supported the anti-addiction provisions of the deal.
""This settlement is another step in our ongoing effort to reset our company and we applaud the Attorney General's plan to deploy resources to address underage use,"" Juul said in a statement. ""We will continue working with federal and state stakeholders to advance a fully regulated, science-based marketplace for vapor products.""
Arizona is the second state to reach an agreement with Juul over its marketing practices. The company previously agreed to pay $40 million to resolve a similar lawsuit by North Carolina.
Juul's e-cigarettes resemble USB flash drives and work by vaporizing a nicotine-laced liquid.
In its 2020 lawsuit, Arizona accused the company of using fruit-flavored liquid pods, social media campaigns and free giveaways to appeal to young customers, leading to a spike in addiction among teens.
The company still faces more than 2,000 lawsuits, including from state and local governments, making similar claims. Marlboro cigarette maker Altria Group Inc, which in 2018 acquired a 35% stake in Juul, is also named as a defendant in many of the lawsuits.
Along with other e-cigarette makers, Juul was required to apply for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its products under a 2016 federal rule, though it was allowed to continuing marketing them in the meantime. The agency has not yet acted on the application, saying in September that it needed more time.
The case is Arizona v. Juul Labs Inc, Superior Court of the State of Arizona, Maricopa County, No. CV2020-000371.

Four of the five people killed by an SUV racing through a Wisconsin Christmas parade on Sunday were affiliated with the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, a beloved pompom-thrusting dance troupe, according to a local newspaper.
Ginny Sorenson, 79, LeAnna Owen, 71, and Tamara Durand, 52, were members, while Wilhelm Hospel, 81, helped the group, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The fifth victim, Jane Kulich, 52, worked at Citizens Bank, according to her Facebook profile. Her page included posts about the birth of a granddaughter, as well as pictures of family, nature and cats.
The five were killed when a man out on bail from a domestic abuse case and suspected in another violent altercation earlier that Sunday rammed a red SUV through the parade in the city of Waukesha, roughly 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee.
Tributes began to flow in for the victims on Monday, with the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies paying homage on Facebook.
""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies. Their eyes gleamed.....[with the] joy of being a Grannie,"" read the message. ""Our hearts are heavy at this most difficult time.""
Sorenson, a registered nurse, was the group choreographer and had been working with Grannies for some 19 years, according to a feature on the group published by CBS 58 over the summer.
""She's like the heart and soul, honest to God,"" one dancer said of the grandmother of six. ""She keeps us on our toes.""
In a photo posted in 2019, Sorenson, decked out in a fluffy white hat and thick blue winter skirt and coat, grins as she thrusts pompoms to one side and walks down a street.

125,"WAUKESHA, Wis., Nov 23 (Reuters) - The man accused of driving his vehicle into a traditional Christmas parade near Milwaukee made his first court appearance on Tuesday since the weekend rampage and was charged with homicide, as the death toll rose to six.
The death toll was raised after prosecutors said an 8-year-old boy had died, marking the first death of a child in the incident.
Darrell Brooks, 39, appeared in Waukesha County Circuit Court and the court commissioner set bail at $5 million. Authorities said Brooks deliberately drove an SUV through police barricades on Sunday and the annual parade in the city of Waukesha, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee.
The high bail comes after Brooks was released from custody in another case after posting $1,000 cash bond on Nov. 11, an amount that the Milwaukee County district attorney's office now says was ""inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges"" against him.
Brooks on Tuesday was charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, according to prosecutors, who said he has a criminal history in three states. The charges were set before the death of the 8-year-old was disclosed. Prosecutors said more charges were pending.
In addition to those killed, more than 60 people were injured.
Brooks, a Milwaukee resident, was arrested near the scene of the carnage on Sunday. Police have ruled out terrorism as a motive and said Brooks, who was out on bail from a domestic abuse case, acted alone.
Police were not pursuing Brooks when he drove his car through the parade route, but one officer fired shots to try to stop the sport utility vehicle, Waukesha police Chief Daniel Thompson said.
The victims killed ranged in age from 8 to 81, and included some members of the ""Milwaukee Dancing Grannies"" parade group.
The injured included at least 18 children, who suffered facial abrasions, broken bones and serious head injuries and were taken to Wisconsin Children's hospital in Milwaukee. Some were listed in critical condition, officials said. At least two of the children have been discharged from the hospital.
""Our hearts are heavy over the loss of our grannies and volunteer,"" the Dancing Grannies said on Facebook on Tuesday, adding that some of the injured members were in stable condition and one has been released from a hospital.
The incident drew the attention of President Joe Biden, who called the attack  ""horrific,"" and Pope Francis. The Vatican sent a condolence message to the Roman Catholic bishop of Milwaukee on Tuesday.
""The pope ""commends the souls of those who died to almighty God's loving mercy and implores the divine gifts of healing and consolation upon the injured and bereaved,"" the message said.  read more 
At one of several vigils and services on Monday, Jeremy Wittig, 39, an information technology professional, said,  ""Waukesha is strong. That’s why we are out here.”
Video of the incident posted on social media showed a red SUV racing alongside the parade route and then into the procession, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before bystanders raced from sidewalks to help.
""I saw children who were run over,"" Brian Hoffman, 33, a Waukesha resident, recounted on Monday. ""I am still totally shocked.""
The $1,000 bail in the previous case was set after Brooks was charged on Nov. 5 with obstructing an officer, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct and felony bail jumping in a domestic abuse case, prosecutors and state court records show.
Shortly before Sunday's attack on the parade, police received a domestic disturbance complaint involving Brooks and a knife, Thompson said.",0
126,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Weeknd's hit single ""Blinding Lights"" has ousted Chubby Checkers 1960s hit ""The Twist"" as the all-time No. 1 song on the Billboard single charts.
Billboard said on Tuesday that the Canadian artist's single had spent 90 weeks on its Hot 100 chart. It was also a top 5 hit for 43 weeks and a top 10 hit for 57 weeks.
Billboard said the long chart run had earned ""Blinding Lights"" the title of No. 1 song on its Greatest Songs of All Time Hot 100 Chart.
Checker's ""The Twist,"" which launched a new dance craze, was awarded the title in 2008 after separate chart runs in 1960 and again in 1962. The decision is reached by factoring in total weeks on the chart as well as exact chart positions.
The American singer's website has for years highlighted the honor of ""The Twist"" being the No.1 song of all time. Checker, now 80, still performs around the United States.",0
127,"BRUNSWICK, Ga., Nov 23 (Reuters) - A Georgia jury deliberated for more than six hours on Tuesday without reaching a verdict on murder and other charges against three white men who chased and shot Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who ran through their mostly white neighborhood.
Jurors are weighing evidence from the more than two dozen witnesses called since the panel was sworn in two weeks ago. These included Travis McMichael, the only defendant to take the witness stand, who said he fired his shotgun at Arbery in self defense.
McMichael, 35, his father Gregory McMichael, 65, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment for the killing in the coastal suburb of Satilla Shores on Feb. 23, 2020.
The jurors worked through lunch as they deliberated then asked to break for the night soon after 6 p.m. ET. The judge said they would resume on Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.
Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley instructed the jury of 11 white men and women and one Black man in the law governing the case after lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski delivered a final two-hour rebuttal to defense lawyers' closing arguments.
Before deliberations began, Dunikoski asked jurors to find the defendants guilty of all charges and argued that the defense was seeking to blame the 25-year-old Arbery for his own death.
""Standard stuff: Malign the victim. It's the victim's fault,"" Dunikoski told the jury. ""I know you're not going to buy into that. It's offensive.""
Explaining the citizen's-arrest law at the heart of the defense, Walmsley told jurors that someone can make a citizen's arrest of a person only if a crime has occurred ""in his presence or within his immediate knowledge.""
The judge said such a warrantless arrest must occur ""immediately after the perpetration of the offense or, in the case of felonies, during escape."" Outside that timeframe, the citizen's ""power to do so is extinguished,"" Walmsley said.
The defense has argued that the defendants had a right and a neighborly obligation to jump in their pickup trucks and chase Arbery to detain him because they had reason to believe he may have been connected to previous property crimes that had left the neighborhood on edge.
The law was repealed after Bryan's cellphone video of the shooting caused outrage. No evidence emerged that Arbery ever stole anything on his frequent runs through Satilla Shores, a leafy cluster of homes outside Brunswick. He was killed with nothing on him besides his jogging clothes and sneakers.
Dunikoski said the men simply did not have reasonable suspicion of a crime necessary to detain Arbery, and that Arbery had a constitutional right not to answer the questions the men shouted from their trucks.
""You can't hold somebody so the police can show up, and go,  'Well he must have done something,'"" Dunikoski said.
Dunikoski read from Gregory McMichael's interviews with police in which he said he had no idea what Arbery had been doing before running past the McMichaels' driveway.
Outside the courthouse, Arbery's parents said they expected jurors to convict the defendants. ""God has brought us this far and he's not going to fail us now,"" his mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told reporters.
The trial has underscored divisions among Americans over guns. A jury's acquittal in an unrelated case last week of a teenager who fatally shot two men during 2020 racial-justice protests in Wisconsin threw these differences into stark relief. In both trials, defendants claimed self-defense in fatal shootings.
'DIRTY TOENAILS'
In closing arguments, Laura Hogue, the elder McMichael's lawyer, sought to paint Arbery as a frightening, disgusting criminal with ""long dirty toenails."" The comments upset Arbery's parents, who said they were gratuitously rude, and angered scores of Arbery supporters who have rallied beneath the grand oak trees outside the courthouse.
Travis McMichael testified last week that Arbery tried to fight him by grabbing his pump-action shotgun. McMichael said he was in fear of his life.
Prosecutors noted that he told the police on the afternoon of the shooting he could not say for sure whether Arbery actually grabbed his gun. Dunikoski told the jury that inconsistencies in his accounts and with video evidence showed he lied on the witness stand.
She said McMichael's pointing a shotgun at Arbery amounted to aggravated assault, and someone cannot claim self defense if they are committing a felony, nor can anyone use excessive force in their own defense.",0
128,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - A Nordstrom (JWN.N) department store in a Los Angeles mall on Monday night became the latest target in a string of ""smash-and-grab"" robberies that have hit luxury retailers in California and Illinois as the holiday shopping season approaches.
The Los Angeles Police Department said it had taken three suspects into custody. Local reports said as many as 20 people may have been involved in the break-in and theft.
Law enforcement authorities say they are alarmed by the brazen nature of the burglaries -- some involving dozens of people -- which have targeted high-end stores in the two states in the past week.
Videos from the chaotic burglaries, called ""smash-and-grabs"", have flooded social media in recent days, showing masked figures breaking into stores, running out with bags of merchandise, and fleeing in cars idling outside.
The San Francisco Bay Area has been particularly hard hit given the high density of luxury retailers. The area is one of the most affluent in the country, with a median household income nearly double the national rate, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
About 80 people entered a Nordstrom department store in the East Bay Area city of Walnut Creek on Saturday night, stealing merchandise until police arrived and arrested three people, according to a Walnut Creek Police Department news release.
""Police are investigating what was clearly a planned event,"" the release said.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has directed the California Highway Patrol to increase their presence near major retail areas.
Nordstrom said that it is heightening security by positioning guards both inside and outside stores and increasing training.
Stores operated by Louis Vuitton, part of French luxury giant LVMH (LVMH.PA), and Burberry (BRBY.L) were also subject to burglaries by groups of people over the weekend, according to media reports.
Best Buy Co Inc's (BBY.N) CEO Corie Barry said on Tuesday that stores had seen a large increase in organized theft in recent weeks.
""Sometimes it's with some kind of potentially menacing device like a gun or sometimes crowbars. Sometimes it's just literally run in, grab and leave,"" Barry said on a media call.
Barry said she was taking steps to prevent more robberies by locking up display products and hiring security.
Experts on retail crime say the rise of organized crime before the holiday season is not a new phenomenon, but it has gotten more aggressive in recent years, in part because retailers have enhanced their security measures.
""Retail crime groups need to stock up for the holidays just like legitimate retailers do,"" said Joseph LaRocca, a Los Angeles-based theft-prevention consultant and former vice president of loss prevention at the National Retail Federation.
The groups behind the recent robberies are sophisticated organizations, ""not your normal shoplifter that's in and out stealing little items,"" he said. But that can make it easier for investigators to follow the money to the leaders of such operations.
LaRocca also said criminals may have been emboldened by the passage of laws lessening penalties for some crimes, such as California's Proposition 47, which reclassified certain felony offenses as misdemeanors in 2014.
But Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California-Irvine, said she has conducted studies showing that increases in violent crime are not linked to criminal justice reform measures like Proposition 47.
Kubrin said it was difficult to explain the source of the current organized retail crime wave in California and other states.
""Between the pandemic and economic challenges and issues between the police and communities, there are a lot of factors happening at the same time that make it difficult to single out one factor,"" Kubrin said.",0
129,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Laptop maker Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N) on Tuesday forecast current-quarter revenue above estimates, highlighting strong demand for its personal computers and servers from companies moving toward a hybrid work model.
The company said it was expecting fourth-quarter revenue from continuing operations in the range of $27 billion to $28 billion, above analyst estimates of $26.23 billion, according to Refinitv IBES.
Revenue at Dell's client solutions business, home to its hardware devices, rose 35% in the quarter on booming demand from companies upgrading their computer systems to meet work-from-home challenges.
Dell benefits from having a diverse portfolio of software and hardware revenue streams, and it is now trying to tap into high-growth markets, such as edge computing, cloud and telecoms, that have gained traction since the pandemic began.
Revenue from its infrastructure solutions group, which includes the data center business, was up 5% at $8.4 billion in the quarter.
Total revenue jumped 21% to $28.39 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $26.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's net income surged more than four-fold to $3.89 billion, or $4.87 per share, in the third quarter ended Oct. 29, from $881 million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier.
Meanwhile, rival PC-maker HP Inc (HPQ.N) also reported a quarterly profit that more than quadrupled to $3.09 billion, and said its personal systems unit posted a 13% rise in revenue.

130,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The former finance minister tapped to be the next head of Mexico's central bank said on Tuesday that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had changed his mind about choosing him, casting doubt over the future leadership of the Bank of Mexico.
After a senior lawmaker said Arturo Herrera's name had been withdrawn, the former minister issued a statement saying he could ""confirm"" that Lopez Obrador told him last week he had ""decided to reconsider"" his nomination to head the bank.
While still serving as finance minister, Herrera was picked in June to succeed Bank of Mexico Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon, whose term concludes at the end of 2021.
Neither Lopez Obrador's office nor the Finance Ministry immediately responded to requests for comment.
Ricardo Monreal, the Senate leader of Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), said the president's decision to pull the nomination was made in August, and that Herrera might still be a candidate for the bank's top job.
But after the unusual withdrawal announcement, one Mexican official said that prospect now appeared unlikely.
Neither Monreal nor Herrera explained why the former finance minister's name had been withdrawn.
Monreal said there was still time this year for the Senate to ratify whoever is proposed to take the top job.
The head of Mexico's traditionally autonomous central bank holds sway over borrowing costs in Latin America's second-biggest economy as well as managing inflation, which has been rising steadily this year beyond the bank's 3% target.
The unexpected turn of events over the central bank succession could rattle investors wary of politicization of the monetary authority, whose governor has straddled the terms of presidents from rival administrations in the past.
In July, Rogelio Ramirez de la O took over as finance minister following Herrera's nomination, in what had been seen as an orderly transition of the top economic policymakers.

The top-of-the-line ""Edition 1"" of the Hummer will have an electric driving range of 329 miles, Duncan Aldred told reporters on a conference call. GM is launching the vehicle with that model, with a starting price above $100,000, and subsequent models, with higher EV driving ranges and lower starting prices, will be added in 2023, he said.
Aldred said more than 80% of the reservations for the Hummer pickup were for the Edition 1 model and nearly half of the more than 125,000 people who have expressed interest in the Hummer have put down $100 to reserve the truck.
The Hummer EV will join the electric pickup made by Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O) in the market. Ford Motor Co (F.N) will introduce its electric F150 Lightning next year. Tesla (TSLA.O) is building a plant in Austin, Texas, to assemble the Cybertruck pickup.

133,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Gap Inc (GPS.N) lowered its full-year forecast on Tuesday, with the apparel retailer expecting an up to $650 million hit to revenue amid supply chain disruptions that include factory closures in Vietnam and pricey air freight to ship goods.
Shares were down 19% in after-market trading.
Extended factory closures in Vietnam, Gap's top country for sourcing which accounts for 30% of its production, have led to delays in the shipping of inventory and forced the retailer to invest about $450 million to lift freight by air and ensure shelves are not empty during the crucial holiday season.
""While we had planned into the known supply chain constraints as we entered the quarter, including COVID-related closures in Vietnam, the shock to our business persisted longer than anticipated,"" Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said.
Inventory shortages due to port and airport congestion, surging shipping costs and labor crunches have been plaguing retailers globally, with companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF.N) and Nike (NKE.N) having to deal with the prospect of empty shelves.
Gap, which ended the third quarter with inventory down 1%, said shortages dented quarterly sales by about $300 million, as brands were unable to meet the strong demand stemming from eased restrictions and a return to social gatherings.
However, Syngal remained optimistic over plans to invest into air freight due to continued strong demand for Gap's Yeezy hoodies and Old Navy clothing.
The Banana Republic owner expects annual net sales of about 20%, compared with its prior forecast for growth of 30%. Analysts expect a 28.4% growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Hamdok's comments came during a meeting on Tuesday evening with a group from the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), the main civilian coalition opposing military rule. FFC had previously said on Sunday that it does not recognize any political agreement with the military leadership.
The group stressed during the meeting the importance of laying out a roadmap to implementing the political agreement, reversing all political appointments that took place after the military takeover and reinstating all those who were fired during that period, according to the statement.
Last week, protesters and a Reuters witness said they saw security forces chase protesters into neighbourhoods and homes to carry out arrests. At least 15 people were shot dead during the anti-coup protests, according to medics. read more 
Hamdok and the group called for political prisoners to be released as soon as possible and for the right to peacefully protest to be respected.
Under the agreement signed with military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Hamdok, first appointed after the overthrow of former President Omar al-Bashir in a 2019 uprising, will lead a civilian government of technocrats for a transitional period.
The deal faces opposition from pro-democracy groups that have demanded full civilian rule since Bashir's ouster and have been angered by the deaths of dozens of protesters since the Oct. 25 coup.",0

U.S. STOCKS END MIXED AS VALUE POPS, GROWTH SAGS (1605 EST/2105 GMT)
Major U.S. indexes ended mixed as rising Treasury yields prompted investors to sell stocks that are sensitive to higher interest rates and buy stocks in sectors such as energy and financials.
Indeed, there was a clear tilt in favor of value (.IVX) sectors vs growth (.IGX) within the S&P 500. This as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield  has popped more than 10 basis points so far this week, putting in the 1.68% area.
Energy (.SPNY) and financials (.SPSY) posted the biggest gains among major S&P 500 sectors, while consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), communication services (.SPLRCL), and tech (.SPLRCT) took the biggest hits.
Under the surface, banks (.SPXBK) surged, and transports (.DJT) gained, while chips (.SOX) and FANGs (.NYFANG) were pressured.
A late rally lifted stocks well off their lowest levels of the day, but S&P 500 value is still on track for its best weekly performance relative to S&P 500 growth in more than six months.

BE WARY OF THE BUBBLE (1345 EST/1845 GMT)
Barry B. Bannister, market strategist at Stifel, is out with a note this week with a warning: ""Beware the Bubble.""
Bannister believes that Fed wariness of asset bubbles coupled with the concerns of President Biden and Treasury Secretary Yellen about inflation have changed the ""market risk calculus.""
According to Bannister's calculations, a ""bubble driven by current central bank yield repression may take the S&P 500 to 5,500 mid-2022 and 6,750 mid-2023, creating a systemic risk when it bursts.""
The solution to this dilemma, as Bannister sees it, is for the Fed to adopt a moderately hawkish tilt which lifts the real 10-year (TIPS) yield, bolsters the dollar, ""lowers inflation, tightens financial conditions and reduces valuation for this over-extended market.""
In any event, Bannister says global money supply growth is already slowing, furthering the equity correction case.
And past policy tightening by China has already put the writing on the wall for a U.S. cyclical slowdown in the first half of 2022, according to the strategist. Therefore, he prefers S&P 500 defensive stocks for the next few months.

EARNINGS SEASON WRAPPING UP AFTER BLAST FROM RETAILERS (1230 EST/1730 GMT)
After a week filled with retailer earnings, the third-quarter U.S. earnings season is close to wrapping up.
While reports last week were not all positive, with retail giant Target (TGT.N) warning about higher costs and several companies including Walmart (WMT.N) citing supply chain disruptions, many retailers gave investors reason to feel optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.
And estimated earnings growth for the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (.SPLRCD), which includes many retailers, was up Friday from the week before. The estimate for the sector is now seen at 18.9% compared with 14.5% a week ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday.
With results in from some 95% of the S&P 500 (.SPX) companies, overall S&P 500 earnings growth is seen at 42.3% compared with 41.5% a week ago and well above the 29.4% seen at the start of October, per Refinitiv data.

JUNK-RATED CORPORATE DEBT GROWTH OUTPACES INVESTMENT GRADE (1210 EST/1710 GMT)
Corporate debt rated BB-plus or lower by S&P Global Ratings grew by 7.9% to $5.58 trillion in the first half of 2021, outpacing growth of 1.6% for investment-grade debt, the credit rating agency reported this week.
Overall growth of S&P-rated global financial and nonfinancial corporate debt, including bonds, notes, loans, revolving credit facilities, and preferred securities, slowed to 3.1% from 3.8% in 2020's first half ""when issuers raised unprecedented funding to bolster liquidity and bridge operations in response to COVID-19,"" the report said.
The amount of corporate debt S&P rates grew by more than $684 billion at $22.8 trillion by July 1 with 76% rated in the investment-grade category at BBB-minus or higher.
The largest increases were for debt rated in the BBB and B categories, which jumped by $384.5 billion and $265 billion respectively, due in part to rating upgrades.
Growth in B-rated debt was fueled by a surge in leveraged finance issuance, as well as rating upgrades of more than 80 issuers to the B level from the CCC level in the first half of 2021, S&P reported.

A GREEN FUTURE: PRIVATE FINANCE AND GETTING RETAIL INVESTORS INVOLVED (1118 EST/1618 GMT)
As the dust settles on COP26, there is a lot that has been said on what it means for governments, companies and investors, but the consensus view was that trillions of dollars worth of funding need to be mobilized to have meaningful hope of averting the worst of climate change, and that the private sector is key.
It stands to reason that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is looking to beef up the amount of private capital it can help put to work on its projects.
Ludger Schuknecht, vice president and corporate secretary of the AIIB, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) the AIIB's securitization program was ""well subscribed"", adding that about a third of participation was from outside Asia itself.
""If you look at the spreads, over six months liable for the Class A, the AAA-rated one, in the 120-125 basis point range...So, a good return for those investors who wanted high rated bonds and a good amount.""
Schuknecht said the bank was even ""trying to create an environment for retail investors to also invest in the climate space,"" which he added would be a first in Asia.
While climate finance was earlier closely linked with debt markets and more specifically green bonds earlier, COP26 seems to have cemented the belief among many investors across the capital structure that money needs to be allocated in a more environmentally aware manner.
""Interest is across the range of solutions – discretionary portfolios, liquid and illiquid funds, structured products, direct deals,"" Damian Payiatakis, Head of Sustainable & Impact Investing at Barclays Private Bank, told the GMF.
""For many investors, the entry points tend to be into investments where they are already active and familiar. If I take a step back, sustainability is the next stage of investing, not simply the latest product or trend,"" Payiatakis added.

A SMALLER PIECE OF PUMPKIN PIE: MARKIT SHOWS EXPANSION SLOWDOWN (1054 EST/1554 GMT)
A lone economic indicator released on Tuesday suggests the growth of business activity in the United States has lost some momentum.
While the manufacturing sector's (USMPMP=ECI) expansion accelerated slightly, growth in services (USMPSP=ECI) - which accounts for a larger slice of the total pie - unexpectedly applied the brakes, according to global information firm HIS Markit.
Markit's preliminary ""flash"" purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November delivered 59.1 reading for goods makers, a 0.7 point increase over October. But the services print defied consensus by dropping 1.7 points to an even 57, two points lower than expected.
Taken together, the composite number shed 0.9 points to 56.9.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates monthly expansion.
While the U.S. economy has essentially re-opened for business, with see-sawing demand for goods versus customer facing services approaching some semblance of equanimity, the supply side of the equation remains in intensive care as shortages of materials and workers continue to constrain activity.
""The slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints"" writes Chris Williamson, Markit's chief business economist. ""Input cost inflation spiked sharply higher in November to reach a new survey high, adding to pressure for firms to pass the recent surge in costs on to customers in order to protect margins.""
""Average prices charged for goods and services continued to rise at an unprecedented rate,” Williamson adds.
Compared with global rivals, U.S. and European factory activity expansion is essentially neck-and-neck, with merchandise producers across the pond outpacing the U.S. in output and headcount, but stateside producers enjoying faster growth in new orders.
And since the end of the pandemic recession - the deepest and shortest economic contraction on record - China has been a clear laggard.
On Wednesday, investors will be treated to a veritable traffic jam of indicators as the markets hightail it out of town to accommodate the Thanksgiving holiday.
On tap for tomorrow are (deep breath), mortgage demand, corporate profits, durable goods, GDP, consumer spending, PCE inflation, jobless claims, inventories, new home sales and consumer sentiment.
As for Wall Street, a lack of meaningful market-moving catalysts exerted its gravitational pull on the major stock indexes, with the benchmark S&P 500 on the road to its third straight day in the red.
Energy (.SPNY) is the outlier on the upside, with spiking crude prices  boosting the sector sharply higher.

The energy sector (.SPNY) is the benchmark's biggest percentage gainer as oil gained ground to steady near $80 a barrel after the United States announced plans to release up to 50 million barrels of oil from its reserves to cool the market.

After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

136,"BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Employees at Tesla's (TSLA.O) huge new factory near Berlin will elect a works council to represent their interests, a German trade union said on Tuesday.
The IG Metall trade union said seven employees had taken the first step towards setting up a works council, planning to choose an election committee on Nov. 29.
""A works council ensures that the interests of the workforce have a voice and a weight. This is in line with the democratic work culture in Germany,"" said Birgit Dietze, IG Metall district leader in Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony.
The Tesla plant near Berlin will employ 12,000 workers, although only about a sixth of that have been hired so far, meaning the election of a works council will not take place soon, IG Metall said.
IG Metall has said applicants have told it that Tesla, whose CEO Elon Must is known for his rocky relationship with organised labour, is offering pay 20% below the collectively bargained wages offered at other German automakers.
Tesla is also shaking up conventional German contracts by offering packages with stock options and bonuses rather than predetermined holiday pay.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a phone call or email request for comment.
Earlier this year, Musk was ordered to delete a 2018 tweet threatening that U.S. employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union.
Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.",0
137,"BERLIN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - NATO allies will be scouring the policies of Germany's next federal government for one crucial detail: Will Berlin remain part of NATO's nuclear sharing agreement?
Or will it drop out and ask the United States to remove its nuclear bombs from German soil?
While such a move might be popular among some Germans, it would reveal a rift within NATO at a time when the alliance's relations with Russia are at their lowest since the end of the Cold War.
WHAT IS NATO'S NUCLEAR SHARING?
As part of NATO's deterrence, the United States has deployed nuclear weapons in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey - all NATO allies that do not have their own nuclear weapons. In the case of a conflict, the air forces of these countries are meant to carry the American nuclear bombs.
WHAT EXACTLY IS GERMANY'S ROLE?
Around 20 U.S. nuclear bombs are estimated to be stored at the German air base of Buechel, in a remote area of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The base is also home to a squadron of Tornado fighter jets belonging to the German air force, the only German jets fitted to carry the nuclear bombs.
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE TORNADO FIGHTER JETS?
The German air force has been flying the Tornado jets since the 1980s, and it has become increasingly expensive to maintain them and difficult to find spare parts to keep the plane in the air. The German defence ministry plans to phase out the jet between 2025 and 2030. Should Berlin not purchase new jets fitted for the task of carrying U.S. nuclear weapons, Germany would simply drop out of nuclear sharing when the last Tornado retires around 2030.
WHAT CHANGES MAY THE NEW GERMAN GOVERNMENT BRING?
In spring 2020, Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, proposed replacing the Tornado jets in Buechel with F-18s made by Boeing (BA.N), but the decision was later pushed into 2022.
Now, the likely new German government will be led by the Social Democrats, a party that has some lawmakers who would like to get rid of U.S. nuclear weapons on German soil. The Greens, who are expected to be part of the coalition, also have some lawmakers who take that view.
WHAT IF GERMANY DROPS OUT OF NUCLEAR SHARING?
""I count on Germany to remain committed to NATO's nuclear sharing. It is our ultimate security guarantee,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on a visit to Berlin last week.
Nuclear sharing also gives a country like Germany a seat at the top table, in the form of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, where relevant issues are discussed in the alliance.
""Germany can, of course, decide whether there will be nuclear weapons in (its) country, but the alternative is that we easily end up with nuclear weapons in other countries in Europe, also to the east of Germany,"" Stoltenberg said.
Should NATO decide to move U.S. nuclear weapons to Poland, for example, that would likely be seen as a step towards angering Moscow by bringing them closer to the Russian border.

138,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) said labor costs pinched its quarterly profit and warned of product shortages at its off-price stores heading into the holiday season, sending its shares down 23% in extended trading on Tuesday.
The Seattle-based company, like other retailers, is under tremendous pressure to keep its shelves stocked for the holiday season as shipping logjams, shuttered factories in Asia and a scarcity of raw materials rip through global supply chains and result in product shortages.
Nordstrom Rack off-price stores have especially suffered from severe shortages of women's apparel and shoes.
The company said third-quarter net sales at Nordstrom Rack stores fell 8% from 2019 levels, at a time when rivals Macy's Inc (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) have returned to above pre-pandemic sales levels.
Chief Executive Officer Erik Nordstrom said the business' underperformance was due to internal decisions as much as the broader supply-chain issues.
""We have not responded as quickly and as aggressively as we needed to, with Rack in particular... we've been significantly under inventory plans all year,"" Nordstrom said on a call with analysts.
The company also reported a jump in costs in the quarter as it spent more on staffing its stores amid labor shortages in the United States that have forced retailers to increase wages and hand out hefty bonuses.
Nordstrom said in October it would hire more than 28,000 workers for the holiday season, offering new store employees up to $650 in incentive pay.
Nordstrom maintained its annual revenue growth forecast of more than 35%, while rival Macy's last week raised its sales expectations to as much as 40%.
The company posted a quarterly profit of $64 million, or 39 cents per share, missing estimates of 56 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Shares were trading at $24.60 and were set to post their worst day ever.",0
139,"MILAN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Tempest and Future Combat Air System (FCAS), two European programmes designed to build new fighter jets, will eventually merge, Italy's Air Force Chief of Staff said on Tuesday.
At a time when European Union members weigh closer cooperation on defence without weakening the ties that some countries have with NATO, General Luca Goretti said that Rome could act as a bridge between NATO and Europe.
Italy joined the Tempest programme because it felt it could play a bigger role than in the FCAS programme, he added.
Goretti said that with the two programmes currently in their ""conceptual phase"" it was normal that, in this initial period, each country assessed options on technology.
""But it is natural that these two realities will merge into one, because investing huge financial resources in two equivalent programmes is unthinkable,"" Goretti told members of parliamentary defence committees.
The Tempest project -- which includes BAE Systems (BAES.L), Rolls-Royce (RR.L), European missile maker MBDA and the British arm of Italian defence group Leonardo (LDOF.MI) -- has a budget of 2 billion pounds from the British government to 2025, plus 800 million pounds from the companies over the same period.
As Britain works on Tempest with a view to replacing its Eurofighter Typhoon jets from 2040, France, Germany and Spain are working on the rival FCAS project to replace France's Rafale and German and Spanish Eurofighters.
European military and industry officials have frequently speculated that Europe would end up with one programme to pool constrained budgets and to avoid repeating the damaging effects of competition in the past.
But experts have cautioned that any agreement to combine such strategic combat systems remains far off as companies cement their positions in the existing programmes and Brexit remains a fresh political and diplomatic wound.
The recent new trilateral security pact between Australia, the United States and Britain, known as AUKUS, is seen by analysts as another hurdle to significant cooperation on defence projects.",0
140,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended lower for a second straight session on Tuesday, while much of the rest of Wall Street was mixed, as rising Treasury yields prompted investors to sell Tesla and other Big Tech names.
The S&P 500 growth index (.IGX) dipped and the value index (.IVX) climbed as investors sold stocks that are sensitive to higher interest rates and bought stocks in sectors such as energy and financials.
Treasury yields extended gains as investors ramped up expectations of interest rate hikes next year after Jerome Powell was nominated by President Joe Biden as fed chair for a second term.
Tesla (TSLA.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) fell for much of the session, and the companies were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
“The market is being whipsawed by a holiday shortened week, and it’s taking its cue from the recent uptick in interest rates, giving investors additional reasons to take profits in an overvalued market,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.
With banks benefiting from higher interest rates, the S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK)jumped, with Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) all rallying.
The S&P 500 energy index (.SPNY) also rallied and was the best-performing sector.

141,"SINGAPORE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Singapore is aiming to realise at least 2 million tonnes of carbon capture potential by 2030 as part of a broader effort to make its Jurong Island oil refinery hub more sustainable, its Economic Development Board said on Tuesday.
Many industries are looking at the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions through storage or for reuse, as a way to reach green goals. But the process is still in development.
Singapore is aiming to create a testbed for the technology on Jurong Island, where the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) own petrochemical plants.
Both Shell and Exxon have flagged their interest in building carbon capture and storage facilities in Southeast Asia.
Singapore's EDB also set a 2030 target for the energy and chemicals sector to increase the output of sustainable products by 1.5 times from 2019 levels.
By 2050, Singapore is aiming to increase the output by four times from 2019 levels.
Governments and companies are accelerating the hunt for ways to cut emissions and curb global warming by mid-century, by shifting away from fossil fuels and rapidly ramping up investment in renewables.
Shell said on Tuesday it plans to build a pyrolysis oil upgrader to turn plastic waste into chemical feedstock at its petrochemical complex in Singapore, part of its shift from oil and gas to renewables and low-carbon energy.  read more ",0
142,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Jon Batiste led the Grammy nominations on Tuesday in a best album field that spanned rap to jazz music and embraced newcomers like teen sensation Olivia Rodrigo and veteran Tony Bennett alike.

The Grammys, the highest honors in the music industry, will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Jan. 31.
Nominees in each of the top three categories - album, song and record of the year - were increased to 10 from eight for the first time.
""Adding more nominees is a way to cast a wider net for more music, more artists and more genres,"" Recording Academy chief executive Harvey Mason Jr. said, announcing the change on Tuesday.
Eilish (""Happier Than Ever""), Rodrigo (""Drivers License""), Bieber (""Peaches"") and Batiste (""Freedom"") were among the 10 nominees for record of the year, along with Swedish band Abba's new comeback single, ""I Still Have Faith in You.""
Swift, an 11-time Grammy winner, snagged a best album nod for her best-selling ""Evermore"" but was shut out of the other races, disappointing fans who felt she had been snubbed.
""NO PROBLEMS TODAY JUST CHAMPAGNE,"" Swift tweeted. ""SO stoked evermore has been honored like this.""
Rodrigo, 18, who burst onto the U.S. charts in January when her single ""Drivers License"" went viral, got seven nods, including best new artist and album (""Sour"").
Batiste, who also leads the band on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" scored nominations across the board, ranging from classical composition and American roots to his music video ""Freedom"" and album ""We Are,"" which was inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020.
""WOW!! Thank you God!! I love EVERYBODY! I’m so grateful to my collaborators and to my ancestors,"" Batiste wrote on Twitter.

The Recording Academy earlier this year changed the way nominations and winners are chosen after allegations that the process was open to rigging and Canadian artist The Weeknd received zero nods.
Nominees this time were selected by all 11,000 voting members of the Recording Academy, instead of smaller committees whose names were not revealed. Winners are also chosen by the musicians, producers and songwriters who belong to the academy.
K-pop band BTS, which has yet to win a Grammy despite dominating the U.S. music charts for almost two years, scored a single nod on Tuesday for the performance of their top-selling single ""Butter"" in the pop group field.
West, who's had a contentious relationship with the Grammys, got five nods from his hit album ""Donda,"" which was dedicated to his late mother.
Bennett, 95, who has Alzheimer's disease, and Gaga got five  nods for their Cole Porter duets album ""Love for Sale,"" which is expected to be Bennett's last.

144,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Tuesday urged U.S. energy companies to increase oil supply amid ""enormous profits"" as President Joe Biden seeks to bring down the price of gasoline for American families.
Granholm said the oil and gas industry had leases on 23 million acres of public lands on and offshore and thousands of permits that were not being used.
""At the same time the energy industry is making enormous profits. They're back up ... above where they were before the pandemic started. So they have taken advantage of that moment,"" Granholm told reporters.
The Biden administration announced on Tuesday it will release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with other countries after OPEC+ producers declined to heed calls from Washington to increase supply.  read more 
Granholm made clear that the administration also wanted domestic producers to do their part to add oil to the market, especially given high profits, which Granholm said the companies had used to engage in shareholder buybacks.
""We want to encourage them to increase supply. We want supply to be increased both inside the United States and around the world so that we can reduce the pressures at the pump,"" she said.
Granholm said energy companies had not rehired people who were let go because of the pandemic, had not turned on rigs and failed to take advantage of permits at their disposal.
Biden is under pressure to tackle inflation, which has dented his poll numbers. Granholm said the president did not have control over gasoline prices but reiterated that the administration was looking at every tool it could to shield families from the rising costs of fuel.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the administration did not rule out future releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and said officials had been in touch with OPEC countries.",0
145,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol issued five subpoenas on Tuesday to far-right extremist groups that have backed former President Donald Trump and to individuals associated with those groups.
The Select Committee said it sent subpoenas seeking testimony and documents to the Proud Boys group and to Henry ""Enrique"" Tarrio, who was its chairman, as well as to the Oath Keepers and its president, Elmer Stewart Rhodes.
The Democratic-led committee also issued a subpoena to Robert Patrick Lewis, chairman of 1st Amendment Praetorian, a lower-profile organization known for wearing black shirts and providing security at pro-Trump events.
""We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the panel's chairman, said in a statement.
The committee ordered the groups and individuals subpoenaed to produce documents and appear for testimony by mid-December.
The groups and individuals sent the subpoenas did not respond or could not be reached for requests for comment.
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The committee is scrutinizing Trump's actions relating to those events.
Nearly 700 people have been charged with taking part in the riot at the Capitol. It was the worst attack on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812. The Jan. 6 Select Committee has sent subpoenas to at least 45 people linked to the attack.
The committee said at least 34 individuals associated with the Proud Boys have been indicted by the Department of Justice in relation to the Jan. 6 attack. A federal grand jury indicted 18 members of the Oath Keepers for allegedly planning a coordinated attack to storm the Capitol, including by traveling to Washington with paramilitary gear and supplies.
The 1st Amendment Praetorian group provided security at multiple rallies leading up to Jan. 6 that the committee said amplified Trump's unsupported claim that his defeat by Biden was the result of fraud. It said Lewis tweeted on Jan. 6: ""Today is the day that true battles begin.""
Tarrio is serving a five-month sentence at a jail in Washington. He pleaded guilty in July to two crimes, including setting fire to a stolen Black Lives Matter banner late last year during a tumultuous demonstration after Trump’s election defeat.",0
146,"OUAGADOUGOU, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Burkina Faso on Tuesday buried many of the 49 gendarmes killed in a recent strike on a security outpost, even as the government reported the killing of around 20 more military police and civilians in a separate attack.
The escalating bloodshed has provoked protests and calls for President Roch Kabore to resign over the authorities' failure to curb a four-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands and forced more than a million people to flee their homes.
The Nov. 14 attack near the northern Burkinabe town of Inata, which also killed four civilians in addition to the 49 gendarmes, was the worst loss suffered by state security forces in recent years.  read more 
Hundreds of mourners watched in silence as flat-bed trucks delivered around 30 coffins, each wrapped in a Burkinabe flag, to a cemetery in the capital Ouagadougou for a mass funeral.
Reports that the gendarmes had run out of food before the attack, and had been forced to scavenge and hunt near the outpost, have stoked additional resentment.
""Our brothers alerted us the last time on Saturday night: 'we don't have food,' they were saying,"" relative Okiri Mien told reporters angrily at the cemetery.
He and others also objected to the manner of the burials, which involved some mourners helping security forces lower the caskets into the graves that were then piled with earth.
""After starving our brothers for more than two weeks on the front lines they can't bury them like dogs. We refuse,"" said Cheick Adama Tiendrebeogo, whose friend was among the dead.
Underscoring the extent of the insecurity, the government on Monday said a further nine gendarmes and around 10 civilians had been killed in an attack in the Central-North region. No further details were given.

149,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The bodies of six people were found hanged from a bridge and a tree on Tuesday in a region of central Mexico ravaged by criminal gang violence, the second such incident in the area in less than a week, authorities said.
Three of the victims were hanged from an overpass and three others from a tree, according to a statement by the Secretary of Public Security of Zacatecas state said. Another two bodies were found on the ground of a property in a nearby community.
The killings followed the discovery of 10 bodies in Zacatecas on Nov. 18, nine of them hanging from a bridge, in apparent gang-related killings.
The recent uptick in deadly violence is a result of disputes between two criminal groups fighting for control of drug trafficking in the area, according to a state government official who declined to be identified.
At least 948 people were killed by violence in Zacatecas in the first 10 months of this year, according to official data, some 342 more than in the same period a year earlier.",0
150,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Dan Tronchetti received a letter in August that alarmed him: Summit Carbon Solutions, a company he'd never heard of, wanted his permission to conduct survey work for a 2,000-mile pipeline it planned to route through his Iowa corn and soybean fields.
The project, dubbed the Midwest Carbon Express, had ambitions to become the world's largest carbon dioxide pipeline, moving climate-warming greenhouse gases from Midwest biofuels plants to North Dakota for permanent storage underground.
But Tronchetti's first concern was for his livelihood. ""It would go more than half a mile through prime farmland,"" he said.
The 65-year-old is among dozens of landowners along the route who are refusing to cede their property to the project, according to Reuters interviews with five landowners, four community groups organizing opposition, several academics and industry sources plus a review of filings with state regulators.
The impasse could escalate into potential court battles if Summit tries to seize the land by claiming eminent domain. Such legal fights contributed to the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline this year.
The outcome of the dispute poses huge stakes for Summit's $4.5 billion project, and for the Midwest ethanol producers it would serve who are hoping to wipe away their carbon footprints and burnish their green credentials.
It also represents what could be the biggest test yet for the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry, which has struggled for years but which advocates say could become a powerful tool in the global fight against climate change.
Underground geological formations in the United States have the potential to store 2.6 trillion tons of planet-warming CO2, enough to cover all of America's historical emissions and those to come for centuries, according to the Department of Energy.
But there are open questions about whether CCS can ever fill them. Despite billions of dollars of public investment over the past decade, the technology remains relatively untested.
The United States boasts just 12 operational commercial CCS facilities that together have an annual capacity to store away 19.64 million tons of carbon, about 0.4% of national emissions.
Many other projects have been proposed but have either failed to reach startup or have been suspended because of financial or operational issues, including the $1 billion Petra Nova plant in Texas last year.
Health issues are also a concern. A 2020 liquid CO2 pipeline rupture in Yazoo County, Mississippi, for example, sickened dozens of people.
Jerald Schnoor, a professor at the University of Iowa’s engineering school and former chair of the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council, said his ""high hopes"" for CCS had flagged in recent years after the string of project failures.
But he added that ethanol plants were theoretically prime sites for carbon capture, as they produce a highly concentrated stream of CO2.
""If you accept that climate change is a serious problem, and I do, then this large opportunity of CO2 to capture makes sense,"" he added.
Summit told Reuters its pipeline project would work, be safe, and help the agriculture industry by providing a critical new revenue stream for the 31 corn ethanol plants that have signed on with the company.
""This is a pretty transformative project for ethanol to compete in a lower carbon world,"" said Justin Kirchhoff, the president of Summit Ag Investors, the parent company of Summit Carbon Solutions.
The Biden administration is also encouraging the technology in its bid to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050, and has proposed a big hike in tax credits for its use that is now being debated in Congress. Summit would be a big beneficiary.
FEAR OF CROP DAMAGE
Summit first proposed the Midwest Carbon Express in February and has been working to get its route approved in the five states it will pass through.
Iowa, where state law has required Summit to hold public hearings in nearly every county, has emerged as the most contentious.
The state's farmers have been outspoken opponents to the project at these meetings, and several – including Tronchetti – are petitioning the Iowa Utilities Board to release the names of other landowners along the route so they can organize.
Summit is fighting that effort, according to a Reuters review of the docket, arguing that publishing the list would give advantage to its competitors.
The farmers in the path of the pipeline are mainly concerned about damage to their crops during and after installation of the line, when soil will be disturbed and compacted.
Research published by Iowa State University this month found that first and second-year yields in the right-of-way of the nearby Dakota Access crude oil pipeline were 25% lower for soybeans and 15% lower for corn.
Summit said in a filing with Iowa regulators that it plans to compensate farmers for potential damage by paying them the full value of the crops typically grown on the affected tract in the first year of construction and operation, with diminishing payments over the following two years.
Landowners fear that if they refuse to sign voluntary agreements for Summit to use their land for the pipeline, they could take it under eminent domain laws, as has happened with some oil and gas pipeline projects.
Despite that risk, Tronchetti and Bev Kutz, a Nebraska cattle farmer in the path of the pipeline, told Reuters that they and their neighbors had refused to let Summit surveyors onto their property.
""This is a private company seeking something that isn't in the best interest of the public,"" Kutz said.
The project also faces opposition from some local green groups, like the Iowa chapters of the Sierra Club and Food & Water Watch, who have expressed safety fears and concerns that the project will be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
Most existing CCS projects employ EOR, where the captured carbon is used to raise pressure in oil fields to boost crude production, something that climate activists say undermines the technology's green goals.
Summit said it hadn't ruled out EOR, but that its main focus was permanent storage.
The company declined to tell Reuters how much of the pipeline route it had been able to secure from landowners, but said it was optimistic.
""We are encouraged by the response we have received from landowners and look forward to continuing those conversations,"" said spokesperson Jesse Harris.
SUBSIDIES AND CREDITS
CCS has been slow going around the world. There are just 27 operational commercial CCS facilities globally, according to the Global CCS Institute, with capacity in top emitter China at around 2 million tons a year.
The Midwest Carbon Express, with the capacity to carry away 12 million tonnes of CO2 a year, would outstrip the current biggest project, the natural gas Century Plant in Texas, which can capture some 8 million tons of CO2 per year.
Summit's financial model relies on federal subsidies for CCS, as well as the proceeds from low carbon fuel credits generated by biofuels from the plants it serves.
The Biden administration’s federal budget reconciliation bill would, if passed, hike tax credits for carbon sequestration from $50 per ton of carbon to $85 per ton.
Summit has estimated the pipeline will eventually carry 12 million tons of CO2 each year from ethanol facilities, enough to generate $1 billion annually in tax credits at the higher rate.
The fuel from the plants could then be sold into states like California or Washington which have or are developing low carbon fuel markets, generating lucrative tradable credits.
All of this money could become an important revenue stream for the ethanol sector, which has plateaued in recent years.
But the pipeline’s support for the ethanol industry falls flat with some environmentalists, who criticize the business for shifting millions of acres of pastureland, idle croplands, and forests into corn crop production.
“We’re wedding two highly polluting forms of energy in this macabre dance,"" Mitch Jones, policy director of Food & Water Watch, said of ethanol and crude oil obtained through EOR.",0

The board of British mutual life insurer LV= on Monday said it ""urged"" all its members to vote in favour of a proposed 530 million pound ($712.37 million) takeover by private equity giant Bain Capital.
The deal has faced resistance from many of the 1.2 million members who currently own LV=, who argue they are not being sufficiently compensated for the loss of the insurer's mutual status. Rival mutual insurer Royal London offered this month to work with Bain on the deal, but LV= said it was sticking to its current plan which would give its members 100 pounds each if it goes ahead.
LV=, which was founded in 1843 and formerly known as Liverpool Victoria, set out on Monday a more detailed analysis of why it believed the Bain deal was best, saying to remain a standalone business would require significant investment from its members.
""We all came to the firm conclusion it would not be fair for us to ask our with-profit members to finance a future that requires significant investment, which many would not benefit from,"" said David Barral, Senior Independent Director of LV=.
""It was a decision we didn’t take lightly given our mutual heritage, but we know it is the right choice because it saves the future of LV=.""
Royal London is planning to propose a merger with LV= which would keep LV= as a mutual insurer -- owned by its members -- if members vote against the Bain takeover, according to a report in the Mail on Sunday.
Royal London declined to comment on Monday.
LV= members are due to vote on the takeover on Dec. 10.

The cocaine and the labs, which belonged to leftist rebels the National Liberation Army (ELN), were found in a rural zone of the Samaniego municipality, located in Colombia's Narino province near the border with Ecuador, Molano said.
""This is the most important blow in terms of cocaine seizures this year,"" Molano said in a recorded message. ""Ten tonnes would have seen the ELN receive more than $300 million.""
Despite decades of fighting against drug trafficking, Colombia remains a top global producer of cocaine and faces constant pressure from the United States to lower the size of coca crops, the drug's main ingredient, as well as production of cocaine.
Drug trafficking helps finance illegal armed groups in Colombia amid a long-running internal armed conflict, which has left more than 260,000 dead.
Aside from the ELN, ex-members of the demobilized FARC guerrillas who reject a 2016 peace deal are involved in drug trafficking, as well as criminal gangs, according to security sources.

158,"VILLARREAL, Spain, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho were enough to earn an underwhelming Manchester United a 2-0 victory at Villarreal on Tuesday that guarantees them a spot in the Champions League knockout stages.
United came into the contest knowing victory would see them through to the last 16 with one group match left to play, but in Michael Carrick's first game as interim manager, United looked shorn of ideas in attack in the Estadio de la Ceramica.
The home side had much the better chances, with United goalkeeper David de Gea bailing his team out with several fine saves, the best of which denied Manu Trigueros a goal.
Out of nowhere, however, a poor pass from Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli that was miscontrolled by Etienne Capoue was then seized upon by Ronaldo, who lofted the ball over the stranded Rulli to give United the lead in the 78th minute.
Ronaldo's goals have been crucial for United in Europe this season. He scored late winners against Atalanta and Villarreal in the reverse fixture, while also netting a leveller in stoppage time at Atalanta in the last match.
The Portuguese forward got more than a helping hand for this important strike, but his finish was clinical. He also played a role in the second and clinching goal, laying the ball into substitute Bruno Fernandes, who fed Sancho to put the result beyond doubt.
The performance may have been disappointing, but United got the job done, moving top of Group F with 10 points, three ahead of Villarreal, who can no longer catch Carrick's side due to their inferior head-to-head record.
""It's massive for our season,"" United captain Harry Maguire told BT Sport. ""The last couple of months have been nowhere near good enough. We needed the result for our season and for our fans – we know how tough it’s been for them in recent weeks. We have to make sure this is just the start.”
With the travelling United fans singing the name of the man Carrick replaced – Ole Gunnar Solskjaer – in the first half, there was little other action of note to get them too excited.
A Ronaldo header, straight at the goalkeeper, was United's only shot on target in the half, with De Gea forced into two good saves to deny Trigueros and Yeremi Pino down the other end.
As United continued to sit back, Trigueros forced an even better save from De Gea at the start of the second half, with Villarreal sensing a beleaguered United might be there for the taking.
It took until the 72nd minute for United to put together a real attack of note with Sancho denied by a smart save, before the home goalkeeper's error changed the course of the match.
""It's a similar feeling to the Old Trafford game,"" Trigueros said. ""Their goalkeeper was in great form again.
""They’ve got a load of good players and if you give gifts away at the back they’ll punish you. Ronaldo creates goals from nothing and we made it easy to him. We played well, but once again we lost.""
Sancho picked an opportune moment to score his first of the season in all competitions, hammering the ball in off the underside of the crossbar to seal an important victory for the visitors in an otherwise disappointing season.",0
159,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Americans with incomes over $1 million would see their taxes rise under President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" bill, the U.S. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation said on Tuesday, correcting an earlier analysis that their taxes would fall.
Under the bill passed last week by the House of Representatives and now being considered by the Senate, those with incomes of $1 million and more would be taxed at an average rate of 33.1%, up from the current 29.9%, the committee said.
A previous analysis pegged the proposed average tax rate dropping to 28.2%.
For those earning $500,000 to $1 million a year, taxes would fall to 27.2% under the bill, from the current $28.1%, instead of the previously reported reduction to 26.8%.
Some Democrats have criticized the $1.75 trillion bill expanding social programs and attacking climate change because it would reduce taxes on some wealthy Americans, even as it would raise them for other high-income earners and corporations to cover the cost of the measure.
Representative Jared Golden, the lone Democrat to vote against the House bill, expressed his opposition even with the corrected scoring.
""I objected and continue to object to the fact that the single largest part of this bill is a $275 billion tax giveaway to millionaires and the wealthy. Regardless of the net tax change, there’s no excuse for that provision being in this bill,"" Golden said on Twitter.
The Democratic bill, which is expected to be opposed by all Republicans in Congress, would loosen a $10,000 cap on the deduction of state and local taxes, known as SALT. The change would mainly benefit wealthy taxpayers in coastal states that are heavily Democratic.
The SALT cap was imposed under a tax reform law enacted in 2017 when Republicans controlled Congress and fellow Republican Donald Trump was president.

Las Bambas and Chumbivilcas reached a landmark deal in September, with the mine agreeing in principle to hire local residents to fill transportation jobs.
In exchange, residents agreed not to block the road pending the implementation of the agreement. But the Observatory said on Tuesday that residents were unhappy because Las Bambas had yet to present an ""economic proposal for the communities.""

166,"ORLANDO, Fla., Nov 23 (Reuters) - Remember when twin deficits were a thing for the dollar?
It's been a long time since dollar watchers had the U.S.  current account and budget gaps on their radar, but that could change next year, particularly if the global economy runs hot and the U.S. economy continues to outperform its peers.
The U.S. balance of payments position vis-à-vis the rest of the world is deteriorating. In the three months to June it was in the red to the tune of $190 billion, worth 3.4% of gross domestic product.
That may only be around half the record shortfalls of more than 6% in 2005 and 2006, but it is still the largest U.S. current account imbalance since 2007. The deficit has exceeded 3% of GDP for five consecutive quarters.
According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget deficit next year is seen exceeding $1 trillion, at least 4.7% of GDP, down substantially from a record 14.9% of GDP last year and this year's forecast 13.4%.
That shrinkage is huge. But again, it is still historically large, and, together with the current account shortfall, will require a hell of a lot of dollars flowing into the United States just to prevent the currency from weakening.
This comes as the Federal Reserve is about to unwind its $120 billion monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. By the middle of next year, it will have ceased bond-buying all together, save for reinvestments.
To be sure, deficits will not be the dollar's main driver next year. That will be the widening interest rate differential in its favor as the Fed prepares to raise rates, while other central banks - notably the ECB and BOJ - keep their powder dry.
There are two other important reasons why structural issues are unlikely to suddenly torpedo the dollar.
One is U.S. ""exceptionalism"" - the dollar's reserve status, Treasuries' position as global interest rate benchmark, and Wall Street's global market leadership role. The U.S. current account deficit is unlike a current account deficit anywhere else.
Second, ""fair value"" models for exchange rates in which balance of payment flows factor heavily may work over the long term, but are less reliable for shorter periods.
But dollar bulls would be wise not to be complacent about the twin deficit issue.
""You can rest assured it will be the first port of call if the dollar starts to consistently weaken,"" reckons Deutsche Bank strategist Alan Ruskin.
He suggests that a current account deficit of 4% or more of GDP be a warning sign for the dollar, and a more significant downdraft for the currency would follow in the unlikely event that it reaches 5% or more.
DOLLAR OVER-VALUED?
The dollar is paying no heed to the widening imbalance. Supported by the Fed gearing up for interest rate liftoff in 2022, it is up 7% so far this year against a basket of major currencies, on track for its biggest rise in six years.  read more 
But analysts at Goldman Sachs argue that the wide U.S. current account deficit implies that the dollar is over-valued by as much as 13%. They calculate that a deficit of around 2.5% of GDP is a sustainable norm, so the current level is a headwind to the dollar.
""If the current account deficit remains wide even as fiscal stimulus fades, dollar weakness may eventually be required to achieve external balance,"" they write, forecasting an average deficit next year of 3.2% of GDP.
Where are the inflows going to come from? Wall Street's relentless rally this year has attracted worldwide demand for U.S. stocks, creating a virtuous cycle of rising asset prices and inflows.
The S&P 500 is up 25% so year to date, and could make a new record for fresh all-time highs in a calendar year. Alex Etra at Exante Data calculates that financing of the current account deficit is increasingly coming from European equity investors in the place of overseas reserves managers.
If imbalances continue to grow, pressure on the dollar will surely intensify, he warns.
But Daragh Maher, head of research Americas at HSBC, counters that the U.S. twin deficits have been a constant feature for the past 50 years, and that the dominant narrative for the dollar has either been risk appetite or relative rates.
""Right now, it's relative rates, and the structural story is story is secondary, at best,"" he notes.",0
167,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - As the Biden administration and allies scramble to deliver more oil to market through stockpile releases, shale producers are tapping the brakes on reinvestment, according to new data, a sign of the widening split between U.S. oil companies and Washington.
That restraint has become the latest friction point between oil producers and the White House. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden launched coordinated oil stockpile releases with China, India, Japan and South Korea after efforts to cajole OPEC and U.S. producers to speed up production failed.  read more 
The rate at which U.S. shale producers put cash from operations into drilling for oil and gas fell to a record low last quarter, data from consultancy Rystad Energy showed, as those firms returned cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
The third-quarter reinvestment rate was 46%, below the historical average of 130%, Rystad said in a report this week. Reinvestment could fall further, its analysts said.
LIMITED NEW OIL
U.S. shale companies are targeting flat to 5% production growth next year, while private companies and oil majors combined could add up to 500,000 bpd by December 2022, said Rystad.
The rate of growth has kept U.S. oil production below the peak. The United States in October pumped around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) fewer than the 12.97 million bpd peak two years ago, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Next year, output is forecast to average 11.9 million bpd.
Shale companies contacted by Reuters, including EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) and Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O), declined to comment on the coordinated release of petroleum reserves, which could drive down oil prices. But their modest spending from rising profit shows they are not falling back on old habits.
""Prolific shale production was a buffer to market perturbations and it isn't there any more,"" said Kevin Book, managing director at research firm Clearview Energy. He attributes the limited gains to ""a more cautious shale patch.""
It has not helped that Biden has criticized oil companies for putting shareholders ahead of the economy and has called on regulators to probe whether oil firms drove gasoline prices to a 7-year high.
The administration wants more supply from U.S. oil producers to reduce pump prices, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Tuesday, pointing to rising industry profit.  read more 
""Biden is getting rid of pipelines and messing with permits and making it difficult to operate,” said Harris Kupperman, chief investment officer at Praetorian Capital. Talk about excess profits only aggravates producers, he said.
'BANDAGE' FOR CONSUMERS
""The release of the SPR is strictly a bandage and the only way to create a sustainable lower price and stability is encourage drilling in North America and create a regulatory environment that makes it economical and sustainable,” said Paul Mosvold, president and COO of oil drilling firm Scandrill.
The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's top lobby group, also blamed the reluctance to invest more on Biden's rejection of new oil pipelines and pause on leasing federal land.
“When the administration signals they want to move wholly off of fossil fuels within a foreseeable time period, that makes financing more difficult,"" said Dean Foreman, the API's chief economist.
Oil companies are having to spend more to keep output flat. This year's outlays rose 15% over 2020 to get to modest increases, estimates investment firm Cowen. Next year's outlays will rise between 20% and 25%, with some of the gains chewed up by inflation.
Higher costs for oilfield services will consume 10% to 15% of next year's outlays, estimates Jonathan Godwin of energy tech firm Enverus.
Contributing to the weaker growth are declines in the number of wells drilled and waiting to be turned on. They fell to a 4-year low this fall.  read more ",0
168,"SOFIA/SKOPJE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A bus carrying tourists from North Macedonia crashed in flames on a highway in western Bulgaria before daybreak on Tuesday, killing at least 45 people, including 12 children, Bulgarian officials said.
The cause of the accident was unclear but the bus appeared to have hit a highway barrier either before or after it caught fire, authorities said.
Seven people who leapt from the burning bus were rushed to  the Pirogov emergency hospital in the Bulgarian capital Sofia and were in a stable condition, hospital staff said. They had burns and one had a leg injury.
Bulgaria's interior ministry said 45 people had died, making it the deadliest bus accident in the Balkan country's history.
Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov said bodies were ""clustered inside and are burnt to ash"".
""The picture is terrifying, terrifying. I have never seen anything like that before,"" he told reporters at the site.
The accident happened on the Struma highway about 30 km (19 miles) west of Sofia around 2 a.m. (0000 GMT).
The coach party had been returning to Skopje, capital of  North Macedonia, after a weekend holiday trip to Istanbul in Turkey, a trip of about 800 km (500 miles). A passenger list released by media in Skopje carried 51 names suggesting most  victims were from North Macedonia's ethnic Albanian minority.
Bulgarian investigative service chief Borislav Sarafov said four buses from a North Macedonian travel agency had entered Bulgaria late on Monday from Turkey.
""Human error by the driver or a technical malfunction are the two initial versions for the accident,"" Sarafov told reporters.
""THERE WAS A BLAST""
""There was a blast. The question is whether this blast was caused from a blast in the bus, or was caused by the collision of the bus in the road barrier.""
Officials said they would look at the condition of the highway, where accidents have often been reported.
North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said one of the seven survivors had told him the passengers were sleeping when they were woken by the sound of an explosion.
""This is a huge tragedy,"" he told reporters in Sofia.
He said people sitting at the back of the bus were able to break a window and jump out.
Chamuran Feizulovski, 35, a relative of one of the injured travellers, told Reuters another of the survivors said he had first felt the bus hit an obstacle and then a blast.
At daybreak the bus was standing upright but charred and gutted by fire in the middle of the highway, which was wet from rain.

""Ergin was my friend. He was a very good boy. Very nice. I am so sorry that they died,"" Blerim Bushi, 11, told Reuters.
In Sofia, Adnan Yasharovski, 45, said his 16-year-old daughter Zuleikha called him to say she had survived the crash, and he travelled to see her in hospital.
""She was crying. Her hands were burnt but otherwise fine,"" he told Reuters outside the hospital. ""She didn't say much, she was crying and she was in shock. I only saw her through the door as due to COVID, they did not let me into the room.""
Some relatives gathered outside the Besa Trans agency in Skopje, whose Facebook page advertised trips to Istanbul. ""Deepest condolences to relatives of those who died and speedy recovery for those injured,"" Besa said in a statement.
Zaev said the passengers were all from North Macedonia but appeared to include a Serbian citizen and a Belgian citizen. It was unclear whether the two were among the victims or injured.
Zaev said the passengers were from various communities in North Macedonia, a country of 2 million that borders Bulgaria.
In Skopje, ethnic Albanian Osman, 31, told Reuters he had come to the office of the travel agency with his brother and sister seeking information about their parents.
""We do not know if they were on the bus that crashed or not. We have no information about them. The agency is not answering the phone. Perhaps we will need to go to Bulgaria,"" he said.
Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka said the passengers were from the ethnic Albanian community. ""Great grief for the 45 lost lives of Albanians from Northern Macedonia during the tragic accident in Bulgaria,"" he said on Twitter.
Flags flew at half-mast in Skopje and the North Macedonian government said it was declaring three days of mourning. Bulgaria declared a day of mourning for Wednesday to remember the victims of the crash as well as nine people killed in a fire at a nursing home.",0
169,"STRASBOURG, France, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The European Parliament approved the biggest reform of farm subsidies in decades on Tuesday, in a vote that switches cash to smaller farms and rewards sustainable farming methods.
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has long been criticised for handing the bulk of the subsidies to big landowners and agro-industrial firms.
The reform will change that, its backers say, even though green groups say it does not do enough to protect the environment and fight climate change.
""Farming will be fairer and more sustainable,"" said Norbert Lins, who chairs the European Parliament's agriculture committee, calling it the biggest reform since 1992.
The CAP, worth around a third of the EU's 2021-2027 budget, will spend 387 billion euros ($436 billion) on payments to farmers and support for rural development.
The new CAP rules, which will apply from 2023, aim to shift money from intensive farming practices to protecting nature, and reduce the 10% of EU greenhouse gases emitted by agriculture.
The reform will require that 20% of payments to farmers from 2023-2024 being spent on ""eco-schemes"", rising to 25% of payments in 2025-2027. It does not define an eco-scheme, but examples could include restoring wetlands to absorb CO2, or organic farming.
At least 10% of CAP funds will go to smaller farms and all farmers' payments would be tied to complying with environmental rules.
The reform also creates a 450-million-euro crisis fund in case agricultural markets are disrupted by an emergency such as a pandemic.
Peter Jahr, an EU lawmaker who helped foster the deal, said it was far from perfect, but that at some point compromises had to be reached so it could get a green light.
""I'm urging you, please, in the interest of the European farmers, in the interest of the climate, to vote in favour,"" he told the European Parliament earlier in the day.

170,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. banks must seek and obtain written permission from their bank supervisors before engaging in certain activities involving cryptocurrency, a major regulator said on Tuesday.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said banks must be able to demonstrate they have appropriate risk management tools before taking on activities like providing custody services for customers' crypto holdings.
“Because many of these technologies and products present novel risks, banks must be able to demonstrate that they have appropriate risk management systems and controls in place to conduct them safely,"" said acting Comptroller Michael Hsu in a statement.
The new stance from the regulator places a higher bar on banks considering some crypto activities, after the agency under former President Donald Trump cleared the way for banks to engage in some crypto work.
Under the new interpretive letter, banks are not allowed to engage in several crypto-related activities, such as providing custody for crypto assets and using dollar deposits and reserves to back ""stablecoins,"" without first notifying their bank supervisors of their intention to engage in that activity.
Supervisors will then review the bank's risk management tools and systems, and allow the activity only if banks demonstrate they can do so in a safe and sound manner.
A separate joint statement from the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the OCC issued on Tuesday said banking regulators intend to clarify in 2022 what role traditional banks can legally play in the cryptocurrency market. L1N2SE1RJ",0

BE WARY OF THE BUBBLE (1345 EST/1845 GMT)
Barry B. Bannister, market strategist at Stifel, is out with a note this week with a warning: ""Beware the Bubble.""
Bannister believes that Fed wariness of asset bubbles coupled with the concerns of President Biden and Treasury Secretary Yellen about inflation have changed the ""market risk calculus.""
According to Bannister's calculations, a ""bubble driven by current central bank yield repression may take the S&P 500 to 5,500 mid-2022 and 6,750 mid-2023, creating a systemic risk when it bursts.""
The solution to this dilemma, as Bannister sees it, is for the Fed to adopt a moderately hawkish tilt which lifts the real 10-year (TIPS) yield, bolsters the dollar, ""lowers inflation, tightens financial conditions and reduces valuation for this over-extended market.""
In any event, Bannister says global money supply growth is already slowing, furthering the equity correction case.
And past policy tightening by China has already put the writing on the wall for a U.S. cyclical slowdown in the first half of 2022, according to the strategist. Therefore, he prefers S&P 500 defensive stocks for the next few months.

EARNINGS SEASON WRAPPING UP AFTER BLAST FROM RETAILERS (1230 EST/1730 GMT)
After a week filled with retailer earnings, the third-quarter U.S. earnings season is close to wrapping up.
While reports last week were not all positive, with retail giant Target (TGT.N) warning about higher costs and several companies including Walmart (WMT.N) citing supply chain disruptions, many retailers gave investors reason to feel optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.
And estimated earnings growth for the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (.SPLRCD), which includes many retailers, was up Friday from the week before. The estimate for the sector is now seen at 18.9% compared with 14.5% a week ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday.
With results in from some 95% of the S&P 500 (.SPX) companies, overall S&P 500 earnings growth is seen at 42.3% compared with 41.5% a week ago and well above the 29.4% seen at the start of October, per Refinitiv data.
The percentage of companies beating earnings estimates has remained high as well, and was at 80.8% as of Friday.

JUNK-RATED CORPORATE DEBT GROWTH OUTPACES INVESTMENT GRADE (1210 EST/1710 GMT)
Corporate debt rated BB-plus or lower by S&P Global Ratings grew by 7.9% to $5.58 trillion in the first half of 2021, outpacing growth of 1.6% for investment-grade debt, the credit rating agency reported this week.
Overall growth of S&P-rated global financial and nonfinancial corporate debt, including bonds, notes, loans, revolving credit facilities, and preferred securities, slowed to 3.1% from 3.8% in 2020's first half ""when issuers raised unprecedented funding to bolster liquidity and bridge operations in response to COVID-19,"" the report said.
The amount of corporate debt S&P rates grew by more than $684 billion at $22.8 trillion by July 1 with 76% rated in the investment-grade category at BBB-minus or higher.
The largest increases were for debt rated in the BBB and B categories, which jumped by $384.5 billion and $265 billion respectively, due in part to rating upgrades.
Growth in B-rated debt was fueled by a surge in leveraged finance issuance, as well as rating upgrades of more than 80 issuers to the B level from the CCC level in the first half of 2021, S&P reported.

A GREEN FUTURE: PRIVATE FINANCE AND GETTING RETAIL INVESTORS INVOLVED (1118 EST/1618 GMT)
As the dust settles on COP26, there is a lot that has been said on what it means for governments, companies and investors, but the consensus view was that trillions of dollars worth of funding need to be mobilized to have meaningful hope of averting the worst of climate change, and that the private sector is key.
It stands to reason that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is looking to beef up the amount of private capital it can help put to work on its projects.
Ludger Schuknecht, vice president and corporate secretary of the AIIB, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) the AIIB's securitization program was ""well subscribed"", adding that about a third of participation was from outside Asia itself.
""If you look at the spreads, over six months liable for the Class A, the AAA-rated one, in the 120-125 basis point range...So, a good return for those investors who wanted high rated bonds and a good amount.""
Schuknecht said the bank was even ""trying to create an environment for retail investors to also invest in the climate space,"" which he added would be a first in Asia.
While climate finance was earlier closely linked with debt markets and more specifically green bonds earlier, COP26 seems to have cemented the belief among many investors across the capital structure that money needs to be allocated in a more environmentally aware manner.
""Interest is across the range of solutions – discretionary portfolios, liquid and illiquid funds, structured products, direct deals,"" Damian Payiatakis, Head of Sustainable & Impact Investing at Barclays Private Bank, told the GMF.
""For many investors, the entry points tend to be into investments where they are already active and familiar. If I take a step back, sustainability is the next stage of investing, not simply the latest product or trend,"" Payiatakis added.

A SMALLER PIECE OF PUMPKIN PIE: MARKIT SHOWS EXPANSION SLOWDOWN (1054 EST/1554 GMT)
A lone economic indicator released on Tuesday suggests the growth of business activity in the United States has lost some momentum.
While the manufacturing sector's (USMPMP=ECI) expansion accelerated slightly, growth in services (USMPSP=ECI) - which accounts for a larger slice of the total pie - unexpectedly applied the brakes, according to global information firm HIS Markit.
Markit's preliminary ""flash"" purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November delivered 59.1 reading for goods makers, a 0.7 point increase over October. But the services print defied consensus by dropping 1.7 points to an even 57, two points lower than expected.
Taken together, the composite number shed 0.9 points to 56.9.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates monthly expansion.
While the U.S. economy has essentially re-opened for business, with see-sawing demand for goods versus customer facing services approaching some semblance of equanimity, the supply side of the equation remains in intensive care as shortages of materials and workers continue to constrain activity.
""The slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints"" writes Chris Williamson, Markit's chief business economist. ""Input cost inflation spiked sharply higher in November to reach a new survey high, adding to pressure for firms to pass the recent surge in costs on to customers in order to protect margins.""
""Average prices charged for goods and services continued to rise at an unprecedented rate,” Williamson adds.
Compared with global rivals, U.S. and European factory activity expansion is essentially neck-and-neck, with merchandise producers across the pond outpacing the U.S. in output and headcount, but stateside producers enjoying faster growth in new orders.
And since the end of the pandemic recession - the deepest and shortest economic contraction on record - China has been a clear laggard.
On Wednesday, investors will be treated to a veritable traffic jam of indicators as the markets hightail it out of town to accommodate the Thanksgiving holiday.
On tap for tomorrow are (deep breath), mortgage demand, corporate profits, durable goods, GDP, consumer spending, PCE inflation, jobless claims, inventories, new home sales and consumer sentiment.
As for Wall Street, a lack of meaningful market-moving catalysts exerted its gravitational pull on the major stock indexes, with the benchmark S&P 500 on the road to its third straight day in the red.
Energy (.SPNY) is the outlier on the upside, with spiking crude prices  boosting the sector sharply higher.

CAN WALL STREET STAGE A COMEBACK? (1015 EST/1515 GMT)
After opening as a mixed bag Wall Street's three major averages managed to turn positive in Tuesday's early trading after U.S. HIS Markit data showed U.S. business activity slowed moderately in November amid labor shortages and raw material delays, contributing to soaring prices halfway through the fourth quarter.  read more 
However, the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) were less sure of themselves, and have quickly dipped back into the red.
At last glance there were four modestly declining sectors with tech (.SPLRCT) off most. Communications services (.SPLRCL), consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and healthcare (.SPXHC) are down.
The energy sector (.SPNY) is the benchmark's biggest percentage gainer as oil gained ground to steady near $80 a barrel after the United States announced plans to release up to 50 million barrels of oil from its reserves to cool the market.
Markets are also still digesting Monday's news that Jerome Powell was nominated for a second term as Fed Chair and the fact that expectations were pushed forward on Monday for an interest rate hike by as soon as June 2022 compared with the previous expectation for July.  read more

LIRA IN CRISIS AGAIN, BUT NOT A GLOBAL CONTAGION JUST YET (0917 EST/1417 GMT)
After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

172,"SANTIAGO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Chile's lower house approved on Tuesday a bill that would permit same-sex marriage in the South American country of 19 million, sending the measure back to the Senate where it appears to have the support needed to become law.
The measure, which originated in the upper house, was approved in the nation's Chamber of Deputies with 97 votes in favor and 35 against. As the lower house made some changes to the bill, it will need to be re-approved by the upper house before being sent to center-right President Sebastian Pinera, who has already announced his support.
Chile has long had a conservative reputation, even compared to its deeply religious Latin American peers. In the first round of its presidential election on Tuesday, a hard-right candidate who has praised aspects of dictator Augusto Pinochet's legacy came out on top, and appears to have the momentum heading into a December runoff.
Even so, Chile has shown signs of moving left on social and cultural issues in recent years, and a strong majority of Chileans now support same-sex marriage.
Civil unions have been permitted in Chile since 2015, which affords same-sex partners many but not all the benefits of married couples, like the right to adoption.
Among the changes that the lower house made was adopting more gender-neutral terminology, such as changing the words ""husband"" and ""wife"" to spouse.
If the Senate approves the lower house version without changes, it will then go to Pinera. If signed, as expected, it would then become law 90 days after the bill is published in the government's official bulletin.",0
173,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Mexico will analyze administering booster vaccine doses against COVID-19, especially for older people, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday, softening his previous stance on the need for a third shot.
Less than two months ago, Lopez Obrador had rejected suggestions that Mexico should administer a third vaccine shot, saying experts deemed it to be unnecessary.
But his government has gradually opened the door to giving more people shots, including teenagers.
""The booster vaccine will be analyzed in some cases, especially for older adults, but that still has to be decided by the doctors, the specialists,"" he told a news conference.
Several countries, including the United States, are already administering booster shots given data showing that protection from the original inoculations wanes over time, and with rising breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated driven by the easily transmitted Delta variant of the virus.
Nearly 76 million of Mexico's 126 million inhabitants have had at least one vaccine dose, according to government data.
The Pan American Health Organization earlier this month recommended booster shots for people who received vaccines by China's Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O) and Sinopharm (1099.HK), which have been used in Mexico.
Mexico has recorded 3,864,278 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 292,524 related deaths, according to government data.",0
174,"BOGOTA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Venezuelan regional and local elections last weekend were held under better conditions than those of previous contests, the head of a European Union's observation mission said on Tuesday, while declining to say whether the vote was free and fair.
The Sunday vote was the first time in four years the country's opposition has run candidates, though it suffered a resounding defeat with the ruling party winning at least 18 out of 23 governorships.
The socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro has long faced accusations of anti-democratic practices from the United States and other critics, although the presence of the EU observers was seen by some as conferring a modicum of legitimacy on the process.
Maduro has said the observers carried out their mission ""very well"" so far, while other senior members of the ruling party referred to observers as ""peepers"" and accused them of arriving in the country with a pre-written report.
""The elections were implemented in better conditions in comparison with previous electoral processes,"" Isabel Santos, the head of the mission, told journalists, while still faulting aspects of the way they were carried out.
""There have been arbitrary bans on candidates for administrative reasons, there have been suspensions, or the most recognized leaders or members of some parties have been withdrawn,"" Santos said.
Observers witnessed the use of banned ""control points,"" meant to track which government supporters cast ballots, she said, and structural deficiencies remain.
Santos declined multiple times to say whether the vote was free and fair and called for the observers' eventual final report not to be used as a political instrument.
Some polling places suffered delays in opening and closing times, she said, though voting machines were trustworthy.
The national electoral authority is more politically balanced than it has been in 20 years, Santos said, and balance is key to building public trust.
""The campaign was also marked by the extended use of state resources,"" Santos said, and ""unequal access to media outlets.""
Opposition figures had questioned the fairness of constant coverage of government candidates on state television and sales of subsidized food ahead of voting.
Santos lamented the murder of one voter in Zulia state who was killed while waiting in line and said one electoral observer and two human rights workers had suffered ""aggressions"" in Lara state.
More than 1,000 polling places in 23 states were visited by 136 observers, Santos said, and her team will release a final report in late January or early February.",0
175,"(Reuters) - Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd has lost a bid to avoid facing a trial over allegations that an Indian drugmaker it acquired  engaged in an anticompetitive scheme to delay the launch of generic drugs by rivals.
U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston on Monday ruled Sun failed to compellingly rebut claims by generic drug buyers that they were overcharged for medications as a result of a fraud Ranbaxy Laboratories perpetrated on U.S. regulators.
The ruling clears the way for a Jan. 10 jury trial in class action lawsuits by direct purchasers of the drugs, including drug wholesalers, and indirect purchasers, such as health plans, accusing the company of racketeering and antitrust violations.
""We look forward to trying the classes' racketeering and antitrust claims to a jury,"" Kristen Johnson, a lawyer for the direct purchasers at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, said in a statement.
Neither Sun, which acquired Ranbaxy in 2014, nor its lead attorney, Jay Lefkowitz of Kirkland & Ellis, responded to requests for comment.
In lawsuits consolidated before Gorton in 2019, drug buyers accused Ranbaxy of wrongly obtaining tentative approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007 and 2008 to produce generic versions of Novartis AG's blood pressure drug Diovan, Pfizer Inc's acid reflux medication Nexium and Genentech Inc's antiviral drug Valcyte.
Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act, the first company to apply to make a generic drug enjoys a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity.
But the plaintiffs said Ranbaxy locked in those exclusive periods by misleading the FDA about its compliance with current good manufacturing practices, when its processes were grossly inadequate.
The FDA granted final approval to the Diovan generic in 2014. But following regulatory scrutiny, the FDA revoked its tentative approval for the generic Nexium and Valcyte.
Ranbaxy's lawyers argued the plaintiffs failed to show the FDA was induced to tentatively approve the drugs through fraud.
But Gorton, in denying Ranbaxy summary judgment, said the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence showing the FDA had not assessed all the evidence of the company's wrongdoing for a jury to assess the fraud question.
He also rejected Ranbaxy's contention that because it never sold Valcyte and Nexium, it lacked monopoly power over those medications. Gorton cited the effect of its first-filer status as an issue a jury could assess in determining whether it had monopoly power.
The case is In re Ranbaxy Generic Drug Application Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, No. 19-md-02878.

177,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - British supermarket group Asda has appointed Stuart Rose, the former boss of Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), as its new chairman, tasking him with leading the board's recruitment of a new chief executive, it said on Tuesday.
Rose, 72, also a former chairman of online supermarket Ocado , will take up the chairman role at Asda on Dec. 1, the group said.
Asda, Britain's third largest grocer after market leader Tesco (TSCO.L) and Sainsbury's (SBRY.L), is owned by Mohsin and Zuber Issa and private equity group TDR Capital.
The brothers and TDR also own petrol forecourt business EG Group, which is also chaired by Rose.
Asda has been without a CEO since Roger Burnley abruptly left the group in August.  read more 
""The process to appoint a new Chief Executive Officer for Asda, who has the vision to take this great business forward over the coming years, is a priority for the Board and we will be supporting the shareholders in this process,"" Rose said.
Asda also named Alison Carnwath, a former chair of Land Securities (LAND.L), as a non-executive director, effective Dec. 1. She also sits on the EG board.",0
178,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street banks are planning for a sustained period of higher inflation, running internal health checks, monitoring whether clients in exposed sectors could pay back loans, devising hedging strategies and counseling caution when it comes to deals.
U.S. consumer prices this month posted their biggest annual gain in 31 years, driven by surges in the cost of gasoline and other goods.  read more 
Senior bank executives have become less convinced by central bankers' arguments that the spike is a temporary blip caused by supply chain disruption and are stepping up risk management.
Higher inflation is generally seen as a positive for banks, raising net interest income and boosting profitability. But if it jumps high too quickly, inflation could become a headwind, top bankers warn.
Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer John Waldron last month identified inflation as the No. 1 risk that could derail the global economy and stock markets. 
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts last month that banks ""should be worried"" that high inflation and high interest rates increase the risk of extreme price movements.
A sustained period of higher inflation would pose both credit and market risk to banks, and they are assessing that risk in internal stress tests, said one senior banker at a European bank with large U.S. operations.
Risk teams are also monitoring credit exposures in sectors most affected by inflation, another banker said. They include firms in the consumer discretionary, industrial and manufacturing sectors.
""We are very active with those clients, offering hedging protections,"" said the banker, who asked not to be named as client discussions are confidential.
Clients that may need extra funding to get them through a period of higher inflation are being advised to raise capital while interest rates remain relatively low, the banker said.
""It's still a very beneficial environment to be in if you need funding, but that won't last forever.""
Investment bankers are also assessing whether higher inflation and monetary tightening could disrupt record deals and public offering pipelines.
""We expect a sustained period of higher inflation, and monetary tightening could slow the momentum in the M&A market,"" said Paul Colone, U.S.-based managing partner at Alantra, a global mid-market investment bank.
Alantra is advising clients in the early stages of M&A discussions ""to review the risks sustained inflation could bring to both valuation and business results,"" Colone said.
Sales and trading teams, meanwhile, are taking more calls from clients looking to reposition portfolios, which are vulnerable to a loss in value. When inflation ran out of control in the 1970s, U.S. stock indices were hit hard.
""We're seeing more interest from clients in finding some manner of inflation protection,"" said Chris McReynolds, Barclays' head of U.S. inflation trading.
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which are issued and backed by the U.S. government, are proving popular, he said. The securities are similar to Treasury bonds but come with protection against inflation.
Traders are also seeing demand for derivatives that offer inflation protection such as zero-coupon inflation swaps, in which a fixed rate payment on an investment is exchanged for a payment at the rate of inflation.
""People are realizing they have inflation exposure and it makes sense for them to hedge their assets and liabilities,"" McReynolds said.
Banks with diversified businesses are likely to fare best during a sustained period of inflation, most analysts say.
They expect that a steepening yield curve will boost overall profit margins, while trading businesses can benefit from increased volatility and the strength of deals, and initial public offering pipelines mean investment banking activity will remain healthy.
But Dick Bove, a prominent independent banking analyst, takes a different view. He anticipates the yield curve will flatten as higher rates reduce inflation expectations, crimping profit margins.
""Perhaps for as long as 12 to 18 months, bank stock prices will rise,"" he said. ""At some point, however, if inflation continues to rise, the multiples on bank stocks will collapse and so will bank stock prices.""",0
179,"(Reuters) - A Dechert litigation partner has left the firm’s London office to join a disputes boutique in the UK capital.
Simon Fawell starts work at Signature Litigation on Nov. 29 as a structured finance and financial services disputes partner, his new firm said Tuesday.
Fawell spent two years as a partner on Dechert’s commercial litigation team and 12 years before that at Sidley Austin. He specializes in banking and structured finance dispute resolution with a focus on derivatives, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset financing and leasing, according to Signature.
Signature bills itself as a firm operating without constraints caused by client conflicts of interest.
“Conflict-free litigation platforms have strong appeal to both practitioners and clients alike, and I am excited at the prospect of building on Signature’s increasingly recognised position in the market,” Fawell said in a statement.
The UK boutique now comprises 18 partners and over 100 members in offices across London, Paris and Gibraltar.

181,"PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A manuscript co-authored by Albert Einstein, offering a rare insight into the legendary physicist's thinking leading up to his general theory of relativity, was sold in an auction on Tuesday for 11.7 million euros ($13.17 million).
Auction house Christie's had estimated the value of the manuscript at between 2 million and 3 million euros.
The 54 pages of paper, around half filled with Einstein's handwriting, are one of only two working documents known in which the thinker approaches his famous theory that laid the groundwork for modern cosmology and technology such as GPS navigation.
They had been kept in the custody of the Swiss physicist Michele Besso, a close friend and academic partner of Einstein's, who co-authored the work between 1913 and 1914.
""That's also what makes it particularly important given that working documents by Einstein before 1919 are extremely rare,"" said Vincent Belloy, an expert at Christie's who hosted the auction in Paris.
""Einstein is someone who kept very few notes, so the mere fact that the manuscript survived and made its way to us already makes it absolutely extraordinary,"" he added.
Made up mainly of endless calculations in black ink on wrinkled, lightly yellowed paper, the manuscript challenges Einstein's popular image as an absolute genius, because it shows that even he - at least sometimes - made mistakes.
""Einstein makes errors in this manuscript, and that I think makes it even greater in a way, because we see the persistence, the thought that was in the process of being built, that is being corrected and redirected,"" Belloy said.
In May, a handwritten letter in which Einstein mentioned his famous E=mc² equation, a part of his earlier theory of special relativity, was sold at roughly one million euros in the United States, more than three times its estimated price.
With his general theory of relativity that was published in 1915, Einstein revolutionised modern physics when he first described gravitation as a geometric warping of space and time, a finding that remains valid.
Christie's did not reveal the name of the buyer.

182,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Nasser Al Dawsari scored the fastest goal ever in an Asian Champions League final on Tuesday as Al Hilal won a record fourth continental crown with a 2-0 victory over South Korea's Pohang Steelers in Riyadh.
Al Dawsari's 25 metre drive flew into the top corner of Lee Jun's goal with 16 seconds on the clock to break Mohamed Kallon's 16-year-old record and put the Saudis on track for a fourth title after successes in 1991, 2000 and 2019.
Moussa Marega added a second 18 minutes into the second half as the Riyadh-based club won the title for the second time in three seasons, having defeated Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds in the final two years ago.
""This success is for the group,"" Al Hilal captain Salman Al Faraj told SSC 7.
""A group that works and strives, a group that loves each other, a group together for a long time, and this is the result...two titles in the Asian Champions League, but we deserve it.""
Al Hilal went into the final, played in front of more than 50,000 fans at the King Fahd International Stadium, as favourites and made an explosive start through Al Dawsari.
The 22-year-old Saudi Arabia international's goal broke the record set by Kallon, when the former Inter Milan forward scored in the second minute of Al Ittihad's 4-2 second leg win over Al Ain in 2005.
But Pohang, who were also looking for a fourth Asian crown after the club claimed wins in 1997, 1998 and 2009, steadied themselves and almost hit back through Sin Jin-ho, whose dipping effort struck the woodwork 12 minutes into the game.
Marega threatened without success in the 31st minute while Pohang's Kwon Wan-kyu headed into the arms of Al Hilal goalkeeper Abdullah Al Muaiouf as neither side were able to add to the scoreline before the interval.
Thirteen minutes into the second half though, Al Hilal effectively sealed the title when Marega held off the attention of Jeon Min-gwang to reach Bafetimbi Gomis' through ball and score across Lee.
Al Hilal pick up a first prize of $4 million for winning the title and will now represent Asia at the FIFA Club World Cup when it is played in the United Arab Emirates in January.",0
183,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - T-Mobile USA (TMUS.O) agreed to settle a U.S. probe for $19.5 million after a massive 2020 outage led to more than 20,000 failed 911 emergency calls.
The settlement was prompted by a Federal Communications Commission investigation into a more than 12-hour outage in June 2020 that led to congestion across No. 3 wireless carrier T-Mobile’s networks, and caused ""the complete failure of more than 23,000 911 calls.""
T-Mobile as part of the consent decree with the FCC has also agreed to make new commitments to improve 911 outage notices.
An October 2020 FCC report found the T-Mobile outage disrupted calling and texting services nationwide and access to data service in some areas. It resulted in at least 250 million total calls failing.
The FCC estimated ""over 250 million calls ... from other service providers’ subscribers to T-Mobile subscribers failed due to the outage"" and ""at least 41% of all calls that attempted to use T-Mobile’s network during the outage did not complete successfully.""
T-Mobile said Tuesday it has ""built resiliency into our emergency systems to ensure that our 911 elements are available when they’re needed. Following this outage, we immediately took additional steps to further enhance our network to prevent this type of event from happening in the future.""
Then-FCC chairman Ajit Pai said the FCC staff report showed the company did not follow established network reliability best practices that could have potentially prevented or mitigated the outage.
The FCC report said the outage was caused ""by an equipment failure and then exacerbated by a network routing misconfiguration that occurred when T-Mobile introduced a new router into its network.""
T-Mobile said earlier its network experienced an 18% reduction in completed calls during the outage but in the report acknowledged network congestion ""likely required many of its subscribers to make 2-3 call attempts before successfully connecting.""",0
184,"OTTAWA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A rush of investors into Canada's housing market has likely helped fuel the belief prices will keep rising and that could increase the chance of market correction, a deputy governor of the Bank of Canada said on Tuesday.
Paul Beaudry, in a virtual speech to a provincial regulator, also said Canada's main financial system vulnerabilities - housing market imbalances and high levels of household debt - had been intensified by the pandemic.
""A sudden influx of investors in the housing market likely contributed to the rapid price increases we saw earlier this year. In such a case, expectations of future price increases can become self-fulfilling, at least for a while,"" he said.
""That can expose the market to a higher chance of a correction.""
Beaudry later added that while house price gains can be expected when interest rates are low, the central bank becomes concerned when it starts seeing signs of ""panic buying or ... extrapolative expectations"".
That type of dynamic is unhealthy and can drive the market further away from fundamentals, which can lead to corrections, he said.
Still, Beaudry noted ""somewhat slower"" house price growth over the summer should lower the chances of undesirable extrapolative price dynamics. When asked if foreign investors were fueling the exuberance, he said bank data showed the push was from domestic investors.
""These are Canadians buying these investment properties... and potentially putting them on the market to rent or just holding them,"" he said.
Housing prices soared through early 2021, surging to a peak in March before slipping over the summer months. They have again picked up steam, nearing that record in October, according to realtor data.
At the same time, the central bank has seen an increase of riskier high loan-to-income ratio mortgages, leaving people more vulnerable to rising rates. It signaled last month that it could start hiking rates as soon as April 2022.
""Vulnerabilities linked to elevated household debt appear to be rising again after a slight pause,"" said Beaudry.
He made clear that Canada's financial system was sound, but said a drop in housing prices could affect household spending and that could impact employment.",0
185,"TRIPOLI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Almost 100 Libyans, including a parade of divisive politicians and warlords from the past decade of violence, have registered as presidential candidates for an election that poses the biggest challenge yet to a U.N.-backed peace initiative.
Libya's electoral commission said on Tuesday it would take about two weeks to finalise the list of eligible candidates after any legal challenges to the 98 who have registered for the Dec. 24 vote.
Arguments over the rules, including who can run, threaten to derail efforts to bring myriad warring factions to accept the legitimacy of a newly unified political leadership.
Three of the most prominent candidates may be accused of disqualifying violations.
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was convicted in absentia by a Libyan court in 2015 of war crimes for his part in fighting the 2011 uprising that ended his father's 42-year rule, and is wanted by the International Criminal Court.
Khalifa Haftar, head of the eastern-based Libyan National Army, is accused of war crimes and other abuses, including during his 14-month assault on Tripoli, which was foiled last year. Diplomats say he also holds U.S. citizenship despite a ban on dual nationals running for the presidency.
Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah made a public vow not to take part in the election when he was chosen in March to be the interim prime minister in order to prevent him using the offices of state for electioneering.
He also did not step down from his role three months before the vote as demanded by an electoral law issued by the parliament speaker in September.
Both Gaddafi and Haftar deny war crimes. Haftar has denied being a dual national. Dbeibah has said the people want him to run and that the electoral law is flawed.
The electoral commission, a technical rather than political body, has said most questions about candidates' eligibility should be resolved by Libyan courts.
Ruling out one of the major candidates but not all of them would probably trigger an angry reaction among their supporters and attacks on the integrity of the election.
Other prominent candidates include former prime ministers, ministers and legislators from previous transitional governments and from breakaway administrations established during the past 10 years of turmoil.
There will be two rounds of voting if no one receives at least 50% of the vote plus one in the first round.",0
186,"(Reuters) - Hogan Lovells said on Tuesday it has hired partner Chris Green from Pinsent Masons to expand its corporate and finance practice in Johannesburg.
At Pinsent Masons, Green led the firm's South African transactional services practice. He focused on cross-border deals and advised local, pan-African and international clients on growth plans in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to Hogan Lovells.
The firm said Green's clients have included Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, brewer AB InBev and chemicals maker BASF.
Hogan Lovells gained a foothold in Africa when it said in November 2013 it would combine with South African firm Routledge Modise. Hogan Lovells in August 2019 peeled off from its South Africa group, which it said had remained financially and operationally separate post-merger, and opened up a new fully integrated outpost.

187,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Tuesday it has filed a lawsuit against Israeli cyber firm NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies for alleged surveillance and targeting of U.S. Apple users with its Pegasus spyware.
The iPhone maker said it is also seeking to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services or devices to prevent further abuse.
Apple is the latest in a string of companies and governments to come after NSO, the maker of the Pegasus hacking tool that watchdog groups say targeted human rights workers and journalists. Earlier this month, U.S. officials placed the company on a trade blacklist. NSO has also faced either legal action or criticism from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O).
NSO is allegedly involved in circumventing security for products made by these companies and selling that circumvention in the form of hacking tools to foreign governments.
In a statement, NSO, which says it sells its tools only to governments and law enforcement agencies and has safeguards in place to prevent misuse, said that ""thousands of lives"" have been saved through the use of its tools.
“Pedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments the lawful tools to fight it. NSO Group will continue to advocate for the truth,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.
In its complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Apple said NSO's tools were used in ""concerted efforts in 2021 to target and attack Apple customers"" and that ""U.S. citizens have been surveilled by NSO’s spyware on mobile devices that can and do cross international borders.""
Apple alleged that NSO Group created more than 100 fake Apple ID user credentials to carry out its attacks. Apple said that its servers were not hacked, but that NSO misused and manipulated the servers to deliver the attacks on Apple users.
Apple also alleged that NSO Group was directly involved in providing consulting services for the attacks, which is noteworthy because NSO has maintained that it sells its tools to clients.
""Defendants force Apple to engage in a continual arms race: Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple’s own security upgrades,"" Apple said.
Apple said it has so far seen no evidence of NSO's tools being used against Apple devices using iOS 15, the latest version of its mobile operating system.
The iPhone maker said that it will donate $10 million, as well as any damages recovered in the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups including Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto group that first discovered NSO's attacks.",0
188,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is preparing to remove Colombian rebel group FARC from the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, five years after the rebels signed a peace agreement with Bogota, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The U.S. State Department notified Congress on Tuesday of its planned delisting of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the Spanish acronym FARC, and an announcement is expected in coming days, one of the sources told Reuters.
Dropping the terrorism designation could help free up U.S. aid to projects that involve former rebels and bolster the agreement overall with a further demonstration of U.S. support.
""We have started the process of consulting with Congress on actions that we are taking with regards to the FARC,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told a daily briefing, adding that there would be more details in coming days.
He declined to specify whether that would mean removing  FARC from the terrorism blacklist, but said the Biden administration was committed to the ""implementation and preservation"" of the Colombia peace accord.
FARC reached a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016, ending its part in the Andean country's decades-old internal armed conflict, which has left millions displaced and more than 260,000 dead.
The deal was negotiated with the support of then-U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, in which Joe Biden served as vice president.
FARC was first designated as a terrorist organization by the United States in October 1997.
Following demobilization, the guerrillas entered politics, initially calling themselves the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, keeping the FARC acronym, then later rebranded as Comunes. The party's leadership received 10 congressional seats after the peace deal was signed.
The peace deal has been beset with challenges, including the decision of several former commanders - who argued the pact was not being fulfilled - to return to arms, as well as the killings of around 300 former members of FARC across the country, according to local advocacy group Indepaz.
The Colombian government, one of Washington's closest allies in Latin America, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Biden met Colombian President Ivan Duque for the first time on the sidelines of an international climate summit in Scotland earlier this month. It was not known if they discussed the  prospects for FARC's delisting.
The Biden administration's decision was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed to Reuters by two sources familiar with the matter, including a congressional aide.
Among the arguments for the delisting was that former FARC members are now involved in so many aspects of Colombian political and economic life that it was hard to provide certain types of U.S. aid due to restrictions imposed by the blacklist, one of the U.S. sources said.
Groups on the list face the freezing of U.S. assets and prohibition on Americans providing aid or doing business with them.",0

190,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's pick for a seat on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will get a Dec. 1 confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, as will Biden's nominee for another key telecommunications post, committee officials said.
The committee will consider the nomination of Gigi Sohn - a former senior aide to Tom Wheeler who served as an FCC chairman under President Barack Obama - to an open seat and Alan Davidson, a senior adviser at Mozilla, to head the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
In October, Biden nominated FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel for a new term on the five-member commission and designated her chair. The Commerce Committee also plans to vote on her nomination on Dec. 1 after holding a hearing last week.
Biden waited more than nine months to make nominations for the FCC, which has not been able to address some key issues because it currently has one vacancy and is split 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans.
The FCC under Obama, Donald Trump's predecessor, adopted net neutrality rules in 2015 barring internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes.
""Now more than ever, Americans actually need net neutrality,"" Democratic Senator Ed Markey said.
Without being confirmed to a new term, Rosenworcel would need to leave the FCC next month.
Last week, Rosenworcel told senators she backed net neutrality rules, but offered few details on how she might move to reverse their 2017 rollback.

Shares in the world's biggest manufacturer of wind turbines, already down 25% this year before the cyber attack, dropped by about 3% in early trade on Monday.
In addition to concerns over the nature of any data breach, near-term market focus will also be on production delays and related costs, including the cost of resolving the issue, Citi analysts said in a research note.
The cyber security incident on Nov. 19 forced Vestas to shut down IT systems across multiple business units and locations to contain the issue, but the Danish company said it has been able to continue operations.  read more

In October, Biden nominated FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel for a new term on the five-member commission and designated her chair. The Commerce Committee also plans to vote on her nomination on Dec. 1 after holding a hearing last week.
Biden waited more than nine months to make nominations for the FCC, which has not been able to address some key issues because it currently has one vacancy and is split 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans.
The FCC under Obama, Donald Trump's predecessor, adopted net neutrality rules in 2015 barring internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes.
""Now more than ever, Americans actually need net neutrality,"" Democratic Senator Ed Markey said.
Without being confirmed to a new term, Rosenworcel would need to leave the FCC next month.
Last week, Rosenworcel told senators she backed net neutrality rules, but offered few details on how she might move to reverse their 2017 rollback.
The NTIA, the executive branch agency principally responsible for advising the White House on telecommunications and information policy issues, will oversee more than $42 billion in funding approved this month by Congress to expand internet access.",0
193,"COPENHAGEN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Vestas (VWS.CO) on Monday said the cyber attack it reported at the weekend has affected parts of its internal IT infrastructure and that data has been ""compromised"".
The incident, the financial implications of which are as yet unclear, comes as Vestas juggles record demand for green power against supply constraints and high raw material costs that are pressuring profit margins.
Shares in the world's biggest manufacturer of wind turbines, already down 25% this year before the cyber attack, dropped by about 3% in early trade on Monday.
In addition to concerns over the nature of any data breach, near-term market focus will also be on production delays and related costs, including the cost of resolving the issue, Citi analysts said in a research note.
The cyber security incident on Nov. 19 forced Vestas to shut down IT systems across multiple business units and locations to contain the issue, but the Danish company said it has been able to continue operations.  read more 
The preliminary findings of its investigation into the matter also found that its customers were unaffected by the incident.
""There is no indication that the incident has impacted third party operations, including customer and supply chain operations,"" its statement said on Monday, adding that it had started a gradual reopening of all IT systems.
Vestas is already under pressure from supply chain woes but said that its manufacturing, construction and service teams had been able to continue operations despite the cyber attack.
The company this month cut its 2021 outlook for a second time this year and posted forecast-lagging quarterly profit, sending its shares tumbling as much as 14%.  read more ",0
194,"WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Nov 23 (Reuters) - A New York trial judge on Tuesday extended a ban keeping the New York Times from publishing some materials concerning the conservative activist group Project Veritas, a restriction the newspaper said violated decades of First Amendment protections.
Justice Charles Wood of the Westchester County Supreme Court said his temporary ban imposed on Nov. 18 will run at least until Dec. 1, a deadline for Project Veritas to respond in writing to the Times' bid to end it.
The judge granted the extension at a 1-3/4-hour hearing in White Plains, which was part of a defamation lawsuit that Project Veritas filed against the Times last year.
Project Veritas, led by James O'Keefe, has used what critics view as deceptive tactics to expose what it describes as liberal media bias.
It has objected to a Nov. 11 Times article that drew from memos from a Project Veritas lawyer, and purported to reveal how the group worked with its lawyers to ""gauge how far its deceptive reporting practices can go before running afoul of federal laws.""
Wood said as the hearing began that the case involved a clash between two ""bedrock principles"" of law: ""freedom of the speech and freedom of the press, and attorney-client privilege.""
Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said the newspaper was disappointed but will press its First Amendment concerns. ""No libel plaintiffs should be permitted to use their litigation as a tool to silence press coverage about them,"" she said.
Project Veritas and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The group had been suing over a Sept. 2020 Times article describing a video it released that alleged voter fraud connected to the campaign of U.S. congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat.
Dean Baquet, the Times' executive editor, has said Wood's Nov. 18 order set a ""dangerous precedent,"" while the newspaper has said courts might find prior restraints acceptable only ""rarely,"" such as to protect national security.
Joel Kurtzberg, a lawyer for the Times, told Wood a longer ban would have broad, negative ramifications for journalists.
""What Project Veritas is seeking here is not about the continued use of information within this litigation, but limiting what journalists report and do outside this litigation,"" Kurtzberg said.
Libby Locke, a lawyer for Project Veritas, countered that the Times' use of memos by the group's lawyer Benjamin Barr ""compromises the uninhibited, robust communication between a client and lawyer.""
Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement called the extended ban ""deeply troubling,"" reflecting how prior restraints are ""among the most grievous threats to the First Amendment.""
Project Veritas is also the subject of a Justice Department probe into its possible role in the theft of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley, pages of which were published on National File, a right-wing website.
The Times had not faced any prior restraint since 1971, when the Nixon administration unsuccessfully sought to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers detailing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.",0
195,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - London’s late arrival at the special-purpose acquisition company party may be healthier for investors. Investment firm Hambro Perks on Tuesday unveiled plans to launch the UK’s first blank-cheque vehicle since regulators tweaked listing rules to compete with the SPAC boom in the United States  read more . Hambro Perks Acquisition Company will initially raise up to 150 million pounds and pursue private technology companies worth between 800 million pounds and about 1.5 billion pounds.
Chief Executive Dominic Perks has mimicked many features common to the SPACs that have flocked to Wall Street, and more recently Amsterdam and Paris. HPAC’s founders will receive up to a fifth of the equity for their efforts, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, they’ll only get 40% of those shares when investors agree a deal. Two remaining 30% chunks are contingent on the shares – initially priced at 10 pounds – reaching 12 pounds and 14 pounds, respectively. For outside investors, there are advantages to being a late arrival. (By Peter Thal Larsen)

196,"SYDNEY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Australia's weather bureau said on Tuesday a La Nina weather phenomenon had developed in the Pacific Ocean for the second year in a row that could bring above average rainfall across the country's centre, north and east.
La Nina is typically associated with greater rainfall, more tropical cyclones and cooler-than-average temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
The weather event could boost Australia's wheat yields. In September, the country lifted its wheat forecast for this season by 17% to near record levels citing favourable weather. 
A wetter than usual end to the year could also result in a less severe bushfire season.
""Back-to-back La Nina events are not unusual, with around half of all past events returning for a second year,"" Andrew Watkins, the Bureau of Meteorology's Head of Operational Climate Services, said in a statement.
La Nina events normally last about a year but climate models suggest this year's pattern will be short-lived, persisting until the late southern hemisphere summer or early autumn 2022, Watkins said.
""Every La Nina has different impacts, as it is not the only climate driver to affect Australia at any one time,"" he said.
The United States weather forecaster last month said La Nina conditions had developed and there was an 87% chance of the weather pattern continuing through the December-February period.  read more 
In Australia, a low-pressure system early this month dumped 50 to 150 millimetres (2-6 inches) of rain in some parts of the southeast, the highest in years, triggering floods across parts of Queensland and inland New South Wales states.  read more 
""A La Nina should translate into a lower risk of bushfires and extreme heatwaves over the eastern states this summer ... however, we can expect an increased likelihood of flooding rains and tropical cyclones,"" said Matthew England, a professor from the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre.",0
197,"BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats, who are negotiating to form a new government, have agreed to commit to a coal phase-out by 2030 in a coalition deal, sources involved in the talks told Reuters on Tuesday.
The three parties are in the final stages of clinching a coalition agreement and hope to present the deal on Wednesday, one source close to the talks said.
Climate policy is one of the closest-watched areas for the new government as Europe's biggest economy shifts towards carbon neutrality.
The three parties have also agreed to end power generation from gas by 2040, sources involved in the coalition talks told Reuters. In addition, gas heating systems would be banned in new buildings and replaced in existing buildings, they said.
An end to sales of new combustion engine cars would come by 2035, coinciding with European Commission plans, said the sources. The Greens had wanted an earlier date.
The parties also want to allow ""blue"" hydrogen, or the production of hydrogen using natural gas with CO2 emissions captured in underground or subsea storage.
They have also agreed to form a beefed-up climate ministry to include industry and energy policy, the sources said.
If the parties finalise a deal, the SPD's Olaf Scholz would take over as chancellor from the conservative Angela Merkel, who did not stand for a fifth term in a Sept. 26 election.
Three sources involved in the negotiations told Reuters that Christian Lindner, head of the fiscally conservative FDP, was set to become finance minister in the planned new government.
""That has been certain for a long time,"" said one source. Another echoed that view while a third said although nothing had been finally agreed, anything else would be a surprise.
The party leaders were due to meet on Tuesday in Berlin to discuss outstanding areas of disagreement and hoped to conclude the negotiations on Wednesday, although they could run into Thursday, a source with knowledge of the talks said.
While the Greens and SPD are widely seen as natural centre-left partners, the FDP have historically been closer to the conservatives.",0

199,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch on Tuesday accused the International Olympic Committee of being complicit in China's rights abuses ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Games after the IOC president's call with Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, who supporters say may be under political duress.
Foreign governments and rights advocates stepped up criticism of China's human rights practices when Peng disappeared for nearly three weeks after alleging on social media that China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.  read more 
A former doubles world No. 1, Peng re-appeared over the weekend in Beijing and held a video call with IOC President Thomas Bach on Sunday. But the Women's Tennis Association and top current and former tennis players have called for reassurance that Peng is safe, and rights groups have labeled efforts by Chinese state media to allay concerns about her well-being as unconvincing.  read more 
HRW's China director Sophie Richardson told a news briefing the IOC had shown a ""remarkable lack of judgment"" in its handling of the Peng case and ""active complicity"" in Beijing's abuses. She said its interest seemed to be to keep the Games on track, not the welfare of athletes.
She criticized Bach for failing to make clear publicly whether he had asked Peng if she had access to a lawyer or wanted to file charges around serious sexual assault claims, and encouraged governments to boycott diplomatically the Beijing Games, set for February.
""The IOC has shown in the last few days just how desperate it is to keep the Games on the rails, no matter the human costs,"" Richardson said, while also slamming corporate sponsors of the Games for staying silent on Peng.
The IOC did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
HRW China researcher Yaqiu Wang said the IOC had participated in Beijing's ""government-created narrative.""
""It's very, very hard to imagine they can just reach out to Peng Shuai without going through the Chinese government,"" Wang said.
Peng's case has increased calls for a diplomatic boycott of the Games from rights groups and others already critical of Beijing over its policies in Hong Kong and treatment of minority Muslims, which the United States says amounts to genocide.
U.S. President Joe Biden has said Washington is considering such a boycott, under which U.S. officials would not attend the opening or closing ceremonies.  read more ",0

MARKET REACTION
Brent crude  futures rose $2.29, or 2.9%, to $81.99 a barrel by 11:37 a.m. EST (1637 GMT), after news of the releases came out.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  futures rose $1.68, or 2.2%, to $78.43 a barrel.
Brent and WTI fell last week by the most since the week ending Aug. 20. Both are rising this week.
COMMENTS:
ANDREW LIPOW, PRESIDENT AT LIPOW OIL ASSOCIATES:
""The market is not impressed with the Biden Administration's announcement that it will release 50 million barrels of crude oil because the majority of the release is actually a loan to the market and the volume that is going to be sold was already approved by Congress as part of the deficit reduction legislation.""
AMRITA SEN, ENERGY ASPECTS CHIEF OIL ANALYST
""A lot will depend on how much of this is new oil versus repackaged oil that was being released as SPR anyways. Moreover a lot of this oil will need to be refilled later in 2022.""
""At the same time, this may lead OPEC+ to pause their January production increases, netting off a lot of the SPR release.""
CARSTEN FRITSCH, COMMERZBANK ANALYST
""Some delegates said that OPEC+ might rethink its strategy to increase output by another 400,000 bpd at next week's meeting. To put things into perspective, 50 million barrels is equivalent to a production hike by 1.6 million bpd for one month or by 1 million bpd for seven weeks. This is quite significant.""
GIOVANNI STAUNOVO, UBS ANALYST
""SPR releases are a tool used to cover temporary production disruptions and are not useful to fix imbalances caused by lack of investment and still rising demand.""
""The amount being so far mentioned from other countries joining the U.S. looks more symbolic.""
He said in the United States, the figure of 50 million barrels was above market expectations, but the effective volume was only 32 million as 18 million had been already planned to be sold next year.
""Big headline number but details provide a less strong narrative.""
HENNING GLOYSTEIN, EURASIA GROUP
""The developments point to a period of heightened political tensions between the world’s biggest consumers and OPEC+, which implies increased oil price volatility.""
CRAIG ERLAM, ANALYST AT OANDA:
""The move is more than symbolic, but it's not a game changer as far as the market outlook is concerned.""
""What's having have a greater impact arguably on suppressing the oil prices is the COVID situation in Europe which will ultimately affect demand.""
JOHN KILDUFF, PARTNER AT AGAIN CAPITAL LLC:
""I know people are parsing the volumes. This is a decent amount of crude oil to bridge the gap, and it sends a signal to OPEC+ that the consuming nations are not going to get pushed around any more by them.""
""OPEC+ has been stingy with their output for months now. Supplies have tightened up and they've achieved their objective.""
""The last thing the global economy needs right now is high oil prices.""
EVERCORE ISI:
""While our balances (and consensus) continue to point towards loosening in 1H22, policy makers are attempting to build an inventory cushion, reducing product pricing pressure, and insuring against an externality (weather, geopolitics) event that could spike price while the market awaits rebalancing in 2022.""
""While jawboning can have implications for price (and open interest) in the near-term, the fundamental picture here remains constructive with many of the same drivers that have contributed to tightening balances (measured supply adds from OPEC+ and a muted response from short-cycle supply sources, latent demand upswing lead by gasoline and naphtha). We maintain our 2022 forecast of $72/bbl Brent while suggesting falling OPEC spare capacity into 2022 should remain supportive for deferred price.""
ROB THUMMEL, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT TORTOISE
""The president of the United States talking about lowering oil prices had a bigger impact than the actual release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  U.S. oil prices have declined by 10% almost $9 per barrel since the White House began discussing its options.""
JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT AT RITTERBUSCH AND ASSOCIATES
""Although the indicated 50 million barrel U.S. release is a bit larger than prior expectations, the timing and duration of a release could prove key as far as near-term price response is concerned. An additional unexpected development has been comments out of OPEC suggesting a possible reduction in planned output increases to negate a portion of the released SPR supply.""
""At the end of the day, we are not viewing the SPR factor as capable of precluding an eventual run into fresh price highs, possibly by year's end.""
MARC ROWELL, SENIOR ENERGY BROKER AT BRITANNIA GLOBAL MARKETS:
""The market kind of heard we'd be looking at 20 million barrels hitting the market on the SPR.... We then saw 50 million, which was the dip.""
Rowell said the small print gave more details: ""Eighteen million hitting the market, with 32 million going into the exchange, so we moved higher.""
CAROLINE BAIN, CHIEF COMMODITIES ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS LTD:
""First thoughts on the SPR release are that it's not large enough to bring down prices in a meaningful way and may even backfire if it prompts OPEC+ to slow the pace at which it is raising output. As such, it seems quite symbolic and politically motivated. It also seems a bit impatient. The consensus (and us included) think that the oil market will move into a surplus in Q1 if OPEC+ continues to restore output, which would naturally bring down oil prices.""
MICHAEL TRAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT RBC CAPITAL MARKETS:
""The 4 SPR facilities are 2 in Texas, 2 in Louisiana. So, you are effectively releasing oil into markets - into the Gulf Coast - that are not relatively tight. We see the Gulf Coast as having relatively ample supply.
""So, the SPR action is more symbolic and not meaningful from an oil balance view.""
PAVEL MOLCHANOV, ANALYST AT RAYMOND JAMES:
""Six major economies — every one of which is committed, at least in a declarative sense, to achieving net zero CO2 emissions — are releasing crude oil from strategic stockpiles with the explicit intent of lowering fuel prices.""
""By definition, high fuel prices are negative for fuel demand but a boost for energy transition… and yet, the politics of appeasing consumers supersedes the officially declared commitment to energy transition.""
BJORNAR TONHAUGEN, HEAD OF OIL MARKETS AT RYSTAD ENERGY:
""For drivers wondering if gasoline prices will get lower as a result of the SPR release in the US, the reality is that this may not happen at all, or only with a significant lag time.""
""Firstly, the stock release, especially by the US and possibly China, will be in crude barrels. For this to impact gasoline supplies, it must result in higher gasoline production from refineries which could only happen with a lag and in a case that margins improve while refiners expect gasoline demand to develop positively in the near term.""
CHRISTIAN REUTER, SECTOR STRATEGY AT NORDDEUTSCHE LANDESBANK GIROZENTRALE:
""(OPEC) has been very cautious this year, very focused on rebalancing the market and getting prices higher. They were pretty unimpressed by any threat to lose market share to their shale competitors. Of course, the real next 'test' of this strategy will be next year when demand has fully recovered to pre-crisis levels and for that reason growth rates will normalize.""
""Apart from this, I see little reason that OPEC's focus on price is going to change. And if this is the case, the SPR release is only turning this 'strategic' stock into a 'commercial' one. The consequence would be that OPEC will curb production until the new total commercial stocks have been driven down to a level it is satisfied with. So, I would not be too surprised if the OPEC curbs its production in one way or another at its next meeting.""
FRANK MACCHIAROLA, SVP OF POLICY, ECONOMICS AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS AT THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE:
""Congress gave the President and the Secretary of Energy broad authority to manage the SPR and it's the administration's responsibility to exercise that authority as they see fit. We believe that any impact resulting from an SPR release is likely to be short-lived unless it is paired with policy measures that encourage the production of American energy resources.""",0
202,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday it would make 50 million barrels of oil available from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help cool oil prices.  read more 
The release, a combination of a loan and a sale from the reserve, was being made in tandem with releases from strategic reserves by China, India, South Korea, Japan and Great Britain, the White House said.
Such a move may not have a long-term impact on dampening U.S. oil prices  that hit a seven-year high above $86 a barrel in late October, analysts say.  read more 
The release could allow the Biden administration to fend off criticism ahead of the 2022 midterm elections that it has done little to counter rising prices. By moving in tandem with other big consumers like China and Japan, it could also allow Biden to say he took action after Saudi Arabia and Russia, members of the OPEC+ production group, resisted U.S. calls to pump more oil into global markets.  read more 
WHY WAS THE SPR CREATED?
The United States created the SPR in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo spiked gasoline prices and damaged the U.S. economy. Presidents have tapped the stockpile to calm oil markets during war or when hurricanes hit oil infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
HOW MUCH OIL DOES THE SPR HOLD?
The reserve currently holds about 606 million barrels in dozens of caverns in four heavily guarded locations on the Louisiana and Texas coasts. That is enough oil to meet U.S. demand for more than a month.
The country also maintains small heating oil and gasoline reserves in the U.S. Northeast.
WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE STRATEGIC RESERVES?
The United States is responsible for about half of the world's strategic petroleum reserves. Besides the United States, the other 29 member countries in the International Energy Agency, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and Australia, are required to hold oil in emergency reserves equivalent to 90 days of net oil imports. Japan has one of the largest reserves after China and the United States.
China, an associate member of the IEA and the world's second-leading oil consumer, created its SPR 15 years ago and held its first oil reserve auction in September. Another IEA associate member, India, the third-biggest oil importer and consumer, also maintains a reserve.
Overall, OECD governments held more than 1.5 billion barrels of crude as of September, according to the IEA.
CAN THOSE COUNTRIES RELEASE OIL ALL AT ONCE?
U.S. presidents can coordinate a SPR release with drawdowns in reserves by other IEA members at the same time. A potential release involving China and India would be the first instance in which the United States coordinated a release that included those two nations. The IEA is not involved with this release, because the IEA's rules state that it is not meant to intervene to affect prices.
HAS THE UNITED STATES DONE THIS BEFORE?
Yes. The United States has released oil in conjunction with the IEA on three occasions. It has also released crude - usually in the form of a loan - after localized disruptions like hurricanes or pipeline shutdowns a number of times.  read more 
HOW DOES THE SPR GET OIL TO MARKET?
Because of its location near big U.S. refining or petrochemical centers, the SPR can ship as much as 4.4 million barrels per day. It can take only 13 days from a presidential decision for the first oil to enter the U.S. market, according to the Energy Department.
Under a sale, the Energy Department usually holds an online auction in which energy companies bid on the oil. Under a swap, oil companies take crude but are required to return it, plus interest.
U.S. presidents have authorized emergency sales from the SPR three times, most recently in 2011 during a war in OPEC member Libya. Sales also took place during the Gulf War in 1991 and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Oil swaps have taken place more frequently, with the last exchange held in September after Hurricane Ida.",0
203,"BAMAKO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - National reform consultations in Mali that were scheduled for December have been postponed to an unspecified date, organisers said on Monday, likely further delaying a much-anticipated decision on the calendar for post-coup elections.
The interim government, which took power following a military overthrow in August 2020, signalled last month that the December talks would decide the schedule for a return to constitutional rule via the ballot box.
But the head of the high-level panel overseeing discussions said the date had been pushed back because participants wanted to find the broadest possible consensus.
A new schedule will be announced in due course, the panel's president Zeini Moulaye said in a statement, without giving further details.

EARNINGS SEASON WRAPPING UP AFTER BLAST FROM RETAILERS (1230 EST/1730 GMT)
After a week filled with retailer earnings, the third-quarter U.S. earnings season is close to wrapping up.
While reports last week were not all positive, with retail giant Target (TGT.N) warning about higher costs and several companies including Walmart (WMT.N) citing supply chain disruptions, many retailers gave investors reason to feel optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.
And estimated earnings growth for the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (.SPLRCD), which includes many retailers, was up Friday from the week before. The estimate for the sector is now seen at 18.9% compared with 14.5% a week ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday.
With results in from some 95% of the S&P 500 (.SPX) companies, overall S&P 500 earnings growth is seen at 42.3% compared with 41.5% a week ago and well above the 29.4% seen at the start of October, per Refinitiv data.
The percentage of companies beating earnings estimates has remained high as well, and was at 80.8% as of Friday.

JUNK-RATED CORPORATE DEBT GROWTH OUTPACES INVESTMENT GRADE (1210 EST/1710 GMT)
Corporate debt rated BB-plus or lower by S&P Global Ratings grew by 7.9% to $5.58 trillion in the first half of 2021, outpacing growth of 1.6% for investment-grade debt, the credit rating agency reported this week.
Overall growth of S&P-rated global financial and nonfinancial corporate debt, including bonds, notes, loans, revolving credit facilities, and preferred securities, slowed to 3.1% from 3.8% in 2020's first half ""when issuers raised unprecedented funding to bolster liquidity and bridge operations in response to COVID-19,"" the report said.
The amount of corporate debt S&P rates grew by more than $684 billion at $22.8 trillion by July 1 with 76% rated in the investment-grade category at BBB-minus or higher.
The largest increases were for debt rated in the BBB and B categories, which jumped by $384.5 billion and $265 billion respectively, due in part to rating upgrades.
Growth in B-rated debt was fueled by a surge in leveraged finance issuance, as well as rating upgrades of more than 80 issuers to the B level from the CCC level in the first half of 2021, S&P reported.

A GREEN FUTURE: PRIVATE FINANCE AND GETTING RETAIL INVESTORS INVOLVED (1118 EST/1618 GMT)
As the dust settles on COP26, there is a lot that has been said on what it means for governments, companies and investors, but the consensus view was that trillions of dollars worth of funding need to be mobilized to have meaningful hope of averting the worst of climate change, and that the private sector is key.
It stands to reason that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is looking to beef up the amount of private capital it can help put to work on its projects.
Ludger Schuknecht, vice president and corporate secretary of the AIIB, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) the AIIB's securitization program was ""well subscribed"", adding that about a third of participation was from outside Asia itself.
""If you look at the spreads, over six months liable for the Class A, the AAA-rated one, in the 120-125 basis point range...So, a good return for those investors who wanted high rated bonds and a good amount.""
Schuknecht said the bank was even ""trying to create an environment for retail investors to also invest in the climate space,"" which he added would be a first in Asia.
While climate finance was earlier closely linked with debt markets and more specifically green bonds earlier, COP26 seems to have cemented the belief among many investors across the capital structure that money needs to be allocated in a more environmentally aware manner.
""Interest is across the range of solutions – discretionary portfolios, liquid and illiquid funds, structured products, direct deals,"" Damian Payiatakis, Head of Sustainable & Impact Investing at Barclays Private Bank, told the GMF.
""For many investors, the entry points tend to be into investments where they are already active and familiar. If I take a step back, sustainability is the next stage of investing, not simply the latest product or trend,"" Payiatakis added.

A SMALLER PIECE OF PUMPKIN PIE: MARKIT SHOWS EXPANSION SLOWDOWN (1054 EST/1554 GMT)
A lone economic indicator released on Tuesday suggests the growth of business activity in the United States has lost some momentum.
While the manufacturing sector's (USMPMP=ECI) expansion accelerated slightly, growth in services (USMPSP=ECI) - which accounts for a larger slice of the total pie - unexpectedly applied the brakes, according to global information firm HIS Markit.
Markit's preliminary ""flash"" purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November delivered 59.1 reading for goods makers, a 0.7 point increase over October. But the services print defied consensus by dropping 1.7 points to an even 57, two points lower than expected.
Taken together, the composite number shed 0.9 points to 56.9.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates monthly expansion.
While the U.S. economy has essentially re-opened for business, with see-sawing demand for goods versus customer facing services approaching some semblance of equanimity, the supply side of the equation remains in intensive care as shortages of materials and workers continue to constrain activity.
""The slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints"" writes Chris Williamson, Markit's chief business economist.

CAN WALL STREET STAGE A COMEBACK? (1015 EST/1515 GMT)
After opening as a mixed bag Wall Street's three major averages managed to turn positive in Tuesday's early trading after U.S. HIS Markit data showed U.S. business activity slowed moderately in November amid labor shortages and raw material delays, contributing to soaring prices halfway through the fourth quarter.  read more 
However, the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) were less sure of themselves, and have quickly dipped back into the red.
At last glance there were four modestly declining sectors with tech (.SPLRCT) off most. Communications services (.SPLRCL), consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and healthcare (.SPXHC) are down.
The energy sector (.SPNY) is the benchmark's biggest percentage gainer as oil gained ground to steady near $80 a barrel after the United States announced plans to release up to 50 million barrels of oil from its reserves to cool the market.
Markets are also still digesting Monday's news that Jerome Powell was nominated for a second term as Fed Chair and the fact that expectations were pushed forward on Monday for an interest rate hike by as soon as June 2022 compared with the previous expectation for July.  read more

LIRA IN CRISIS AGAIN, BUT NOT A GLOBAL CONTAGION JUST YET (0917 EST/1417 GMT)
After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

205,"ISTANBUL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira nosedived more than 15% on Tuesday after President Tayyip Erdogan defended recent rate cuts and vowed to win his ""economic war of independence"", despite widespread criticism and pleas to reverse course.
The lira  tumbled as far as 13.45 to the dollar, plumbing record lows for an 11th straight session, before trimming some of those losses to close 10.2% lower at 12.7015. It has lost 42% of its value this year, including a more than 22% decline since the beginning of last week.
Erdogan has applied pressure on the central bank to pivot to an aggressive easing cycle that aims, he says, to boost exports, investment and jobs - even as inflation soars to near 20% and the currency depreciation accelerates, eating deeply into Turks' earnings.  read more 
Many economists called the rate cuts reckless while opposition politicians appealed for immediate elections. Turks told Reuters the dizzying currency collapse was upending their household budgets and plans for the future.  read more 
After a meeting between Erdogan and central bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu, the bank issued a statement saying the selloff was ""unrealistic and completely detached"" from economic fundamentals. 
There was no hint at an intervention to stem the meltdown. The central bank said it could only do so under certain conditions in ""excessive volatility"".
Former bank deputy governor Semih Tumen, who was dismissed last month in the latest round of Erdogan's rapid leadership overhaul, called for an immediate return to policies which protect the lira's value.
""This irrational experiment which has no chance of success must be abandoned immediately and we must return to quality policies which protect the Turkish lira's value and the prosperity of the Turkish people,"" he said on Twitter.
Tuesday's slide was the lira's largest since the height of a currency crisis in 2018 that led to a sharp recession, and brought on three years of sub-par economic growth and double-digit inflation.
The central bank has slashed rates by a total of 400 points since September, leaving real yields deeply negative as virtually all other central banks have begun tightening against rising inflation, or are preparing to do so.
SLIDING POLLS
The lira has been by far the worst-performing currency globally this year due mostly to what some analysts have called a premature economic ""experiment"" by Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for nearly two decades.
Erdogan's AK Party is sliding in opinion polls ahead of elections scheduled for no later than mid-2023, reflecting sharply higher costs of living.
""Prices are rising too fast. I don't want to buy certain products because they've got too expensive,"" said Kaan Acar, 28, a hotel executive in southern Turkey's Kalkan resort, adding he was thinking of cancelling a trip abroad due to the rising cost.
""The fault lies with President Erdogan, the AKP government, and those who for years turned a blind eye and supported them.""
Investors appeared to flee as volatility gauges spiked to the highest levels since March, when Erdogan abruptly sacked  hawkish central bank chief Naci Agbal and installed Kavcioglu, who like the president is a critic of high rates.
Against the euro, the lira  weakened to a fresh record low of 14.4225 on Tuesday as Turks snapped up hard assets.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield  rose above 21% for the first time since 2018. Sovereign dollar bonds suffered sharp falls with many longer-dated issues down over 2 cents, Tradeweb data showed.
As the lira plunged, Turkey's main share index (.XU100) rose  1.7% to a fresh record high due to suddenly cheap valuations, though bank stocks dropped.
EMERGENCY HIKES
The central bank cut its policy rate last Thursday by 100 basis points to 15%, and signalled another cut in December. 
Erdogan received support on Tuesday from his parliamentary ally, nationalist MHP leader Devlet Bahceli, who said that high interest rates limit production and there was no alternative to a policy focused on investments.
""Turkey needs to rid itself of the hunchback of interest rates,"" Bahceli said.
Erdogan defended the policy late on Monday and said high rates would not lower inflation, an unorthodox view he has repeated for years.  read more 
""I reject policies that will contract our country, weaken it, condemn our people to unemployment, hunger and poverty,"" he said after a cabinet meeting, prompting a late-day slide in the lira.
Analysts said Turkey would need emergency rate hikes soon, while speculation about a cabinet overhaul involving the more orthodox finance minister, Lutfi Elvan, has also weighed.
Societe Generale predicted an ""emergency"" hike as soon as next month, with the policy rate rising to about 19% by the end of the first quarter of 2022.
Ilan Solot, global market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said Erdogan would likely wait until a ""breaking point"" before reversing course.
""Right now locals seem content to keep their dollars in the local system. If they start to move money elsewhere, to Germany, to Austria, it's another story... Then we will have a conversation about a real currency crisis.""",0
206,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - British businesses reported the fastest growth in new orders since June this month alongside record cost pressures, according to a closely watched business survey that could pave the way for a Bank of England rate rise in December.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), published on Tuesday, edged down to 57.7 in November from October's final reading of 57.8. But that still indicated strong growth and was a shade higher than economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll.
""A combination of sustained buoyant business growth, further job market gains and record inflationary pressures gives a green light for interest rates to rise in December,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data provider IHS Markit, said.
The Bank of England wrong-footed many investors at the start of this month by keeping rates at a rock-bottom 0.1%, after signalling an increase was on its way, because it wanted longer to assess the end of the government's furlough jobs support programme on Oct. 1.
Data since then has shown consumer price inflation hit a 10-year high of 4.2% in October, while businesses continued to hire strongly and vacancies rose to a record high.
The flash, or preliminary, PMI showed a drop in net hiring to its lowest since April, but IHS Markit said that reflected recruitment difficulties rather than a levelling-off of demand.
Rising wages, higher energy bills and other cost pressures caused input prices in the composite index to rise at the fastest rate since the series began in January 1998.
Separate, longer running PMIs for the services and manufacturing sectors also showed record rises in costs.
But some services businesses said clients were pushing back at the scale of price increases, and prices charged rose at a slightly slower pace than October's all-time high.
Orders rose, helped by reduced COVID-19 restrictions. While most coronavirus restrictions had been lifted in England by July, the more recent easing in travel restrictions was boosting services exports.
The BoE forecasts inflation will hit around 5% next year and its chief economist, Huw Pill, said on Friday that patience would be needed while it returned to its 2% target.  read more 
Higher interest rates will not mitigate the direct impact of a surge in energy prices and global supply-chain bottlenecks. But the BoE will hope they will reduce the chance of a spiral of wages and prices that could make higher inflation more permanent.",0
207,"BEIJING, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that ""certain people"" should stop the ""malicious hyping"" and ""politicization"" of the issue of tennis star Peng Shuai, as foreign governments and organisations continue to raise questions around her wellbeing.
The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one, became a matter of international concern for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.
She re-appeared over the weekend in Beijing and held a video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach on Sunday but the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has said this did not address or alleviate concerns about her wellbeing.
Amnesty International's China researcher Alkan Akad also told Reuters the video call did little to ease fears over Peng's wellbeing and that the IOC was entering ""dangerous waters"".  read more 
An Amnesty International spokesperson said the organisation works ""independently and impartially on the basis of facts, and we hold all states to the same standards.""
""This is not a diplomatic matter,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing on Tuesday, adding that Amnesty held ""anti-China"" views.
""I believe everyone will have seen she has recently attended some public activities and also held a video call with IOC President Bach. I hope certain people will cease malicious hyping, let alone politicization,"" Zhao added.
On Nov. 2, Peng posted on Chinese social media that Zhang had coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship. The post was deleted soon after it was posted.
Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on Peng's allegations. The topic has been blocked from direct discussion on China's heavily censored internet.
The United States, France, Britain and tennis players including Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams and Billie Jean King  have all expressed concerns over Peng, a former Olympian.
It comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Games over China's human rights record.",0
208,"(Reuters) - Loeb & Loeb has recruited San Francisco-based transactional partner Jessica Isokawa from Morrison & Foerster.
Isokawa, who focuses on mergers and acquisitions, private equity and other corporate transactions, joins Los Angeles-founded Loeb & Loeb's capital markets and corporate department, the firm said on Monday.
She previously practiced at Kirkland & Ellis before joining Morrison & Foerster in July 2019.
Her hire at Loeb & Loeb comes ""during what has become one of the most active deal climates on record,"" Arash Khalili, co-chair of the firm's capital markets and corporate department, said in a statement.
The 400-lawyer firm has added at least four other partners to the capital markets and corporate group this year, according to announcements on its website.
That lines up with demand seen across the legal industry for corporate and transactional lawyers as deal activity remains high.
Isokawa has clients in industries including software and technology, financial services and consumer products, the firm said.

209,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The number of homes sold in the United Kingdom fell by more than half last month after the expiry of a tax break which sought to encourage home purchases during the coronavirus crisis, official data showed on Tuesday.
Britain's tax office reported 76,930 residential property transactions in October, 52% lower than in September and 28.2% lower than October 2020.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak last year temporarily scrapped the stamp duty tax on the first 500,000 pounds  ($668,600.00) of property purchases in England and Northern Ireland.
That full exemption expired at the end of June but buyers benefitted from a 250,000 pound ($334,075) exemption until the end of September.
A tax exemption measure in Wales ended in June, while Scotland stopped a tax break there in March.
Other data has shown house prices continued to rise in October, pushed up in large part by a shortage of homes on the market.
Britain's housing market has also been boosted by demand for bigger properties as more people work from home.

210,"PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Michel Barnier, the former European Union Brexit negotiator and now a challenger for the French presidency, said France had lost control of immigration and that a sense of impunity prevailed.
Barnier, who is locked in a five-way race for the centre-right Les Republicains party's nomination, lamented France's ""big decline"" and said President Emmanuel Macron's leadership style was too arrogant and single-minded to heal divides.
""Immigration is out of control,"" Barnier, 70, told Reuters before addressing party members in Paris late on Monday. ""Our security is no longer guaranteed. There is a sense of impunity and insecurity throughout the country.""
Barnier proposes a moratorium on immigration to fix Europe and France's broken rules on migration, wants soldiers to patrol some communities where police are seen to have lost control and advocates a referendum on restoring military service.
An erstwhile moderate of the centre-right, Barnier dismissed the suggestion he was being drawn onto far-right turf to win back conservative voters from far-right figures Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour.
""I'm looking at the problem my country faces,"" he said.
Macron's government rejects the accusation it has lost control of the number of foreigners in France. INSEE, the official statics agency, says net migration numbers have been rising since the start of the 2000s.
Official INSEE data shows 272,000 immigrant arrivals on French territory in 2020, compared with 259,000 in 2016, the last year of former President Francois Hollande's mandate and 211,000 in 2010, when the conservative Nicolas Sarkozy was leader.
The race for the centre-right ticket is led by Xavier Bertrand, who heads the northern Hauts-de-France region, and Valerie Pecresse, leader of the Ile de France region around Paris, but Barnier has emerged as a credible challenger.
CHASING VOTES
The party rivals have said they will back whoever wins next week's two-round vote by signed-up party members. Registrations have nearly doubled in recent weeks to about 150,000 and the outcome is uncertain.
All are running on ideologically similar platforms, and trail Macron, Le Pen and Zemmour in opinion surveys.
Barnier's popularity partly lies in his loyalty to the party - Bertrand and Pecresse quit after Macron's 2017 election win before returning. Some consider him ""presidential"" for maintaining unity among the remaining EU countries during Brexit talks with Britain.
""France doesn't need a third candidate who gets too close to the far-right of politics. It needs someone who pulls us together,"" said Barnier supporter Aurelien Boulanger.
Barnier said he was worried by distrust between London and European capitals since Britain completed its departure from the EU's orbit at the start of this year. Britain is embroiled in a fishing licence row with France and a dispute with Brussels over trade rules for goods flowing into Northern Ireland.
Asked whether he trusted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Barnier said: ""The question is whether he respects his own signature and the commitments undertaken by his government.""
Critics say Barnier lacks charisma and punch. For Barnier, who pitches himself as a conciliator, that is the point.
""My wife tells me I need to be more humorous. It's a work in progress,"" Barnier told party supporters, most of them white, middle-class and middle-aged or older. ""But the presidency is serious.""",0
211,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) were among the lenders that were deemed more “systemically important” than they were a year ago by the Financial Stability Board on Tuesday. The global watchdog accordingly raised the amount of capital it thinks they should hold.
U.S. banks’ share of capital markets, mergers and trading revenue has been rising for years. So has their share of financial risk. Based on Breakingviews calculations using data released by the Federal Reserve and Bank of International Settlements, JPMorgan’s share of the world’s “total exposures” rose to 4% in 2020 from 3.8% in 2019.
Risk-taking is rewarded: JPMorgan trades at almost double its estimated year-ahead book value, according to Refinitiv – at least three times higher than Santander (SAN.MC), UniCredit (CRDI.MI) and Société Générale (SOGN.PA), which are in the FSB’s least-risky bucket. Since the end of 2019, Goldman’s total shareholder return was 4 times higher than the members of the Refinitiv Global Banking and Investment Services Index.
Most lenders already hold more capital than required by either the FSB or the Fed, which ultimately sets capital rules for its domestic banks. While that’s a drag on returns, riskier banks plus risk-averse regulators are a net win for shareholders. (By John Foley)

212,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Reddit is pulling the plug on its TikTok-like platform, Dubsmash, the social network said on Tuesday, just a year after buying it for an undisclosed sum to bolster its video creation tools.
The standalone Dubsmash app will not be available for download after Feb. 22, Reddit said, as it rolled out new camera and editing features as part of its video tools.
TikTok's massive success with short-form videos has driven other social networks to incorporate the format on their platforms, with Snap Inc (SNAP.N) rolling out Spotlight; Facebook, now Meta Platforms (FB.O), launching Instagram Reels; and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) YouTube launching Shorts.
""The Dubsmash team has been accelerating Reddit's video, so parts of Reddit will feel familiar to Dubsmashers,"" the company said in a blogpost.
Since Dubsmash's acquisition, Reddit said it had seen 70% growth in overall hours watched, while the number of daily active video viewers rose by over a third.

213,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Russian troop movements near Ukraine have drawn concern from Kyiv and the United States that it might be considering attacking its neighbour. Here is a look at some of the questions that raises.
WHAT ARE THE TWO SIDES SAYING ABOUT THE RISK OF CONFLICT?
Russia denies threatening anyone and says it can deploy its troops on its own territory as it pleases. It has accused Ukraine and NATO of whipping up tensions and suggested Kyiv might be preparing to try to seize back two eastern regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Russia's foreign spy agency this week compared the situation with the build-up to a 2008 war in which Russia's forces crushed those of neighbouring Georgia.  read more 
Ukraine denies planning any such offensive and says Russia has more than 92,000 troops massed near its borders for a possible attack.  read more 
HOW LIKELY IS A RUSSIAN INVASION?
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen sources, including Western intelligence officials and Russians familiar with Kremlin thinking, and nearly all agreed that an invasion is unlikely to be imminent. A more plausible scenario, they said, was that President Vladimir Putin is using the credible threat of military force to signal that Russia is serious about defending its ""red lines"" on Ukraine. It has stated numerous times in recent weeks that it is not prepared to accept the supply of NATO weapons to Ukraine or any NATO military presence there, let alone the prospect of eventual Ukrainian membership of the alliance. Putin, these sources added, is adept at escalating and de-escalating crises - as he did in the spring, when more than 100,000 Russian troops gathered near Ukraine's border and subsequently pulled back. In this way, he is keeping Russia's opponents guessing about his intentions and reminding the West that Russia is a force to be reckoned with.
IF IT DID COME TO WAR, WHAT MIGHT THAT LOOK LIKE?
Russia's armed forces have 900,000 active personnel compared with 209,000 for Ukraine, an advantage of more than four to one, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). But Samir Puri, senior fellow in hybrid warfare at the IISS, said the real advantage for Russia was that it already has proxies fighting in the separatist war in eastern Ukraine, giving it the option to link up with them and extend the area already under their control. Were it to go for a broader invasion, he said, it could contemplate attacking from the north (from Russia and its ally Belarus), from the east or from the south (via Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014), with a naval assault on the cities of Odessa and Mariupol.
HOW PREPARED IS UKRAINE TO DEFEND ITSELF?
Ukraine is significantly stronger militarily than in 2014, when it lost Crimea to Russia without a real fight. It has advanced anti-tank missiles supplied by Washington, and could draw on U.S. intelligence support. But it would still face an overwhelming adversary - the Russian advantage in battle tanks, for example, is more than three to one.
""For Ukraine, the issue would be ... to resist as much as they can, pray for assistance from the West, and ultimately fight back,"" said Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow at London's Chatham House think-tank. ""If Russia invades in full, the question for Kyiv will be to mount counter-insurrection-style warfare to make the cost of invasion tremendous for Russia.""
WHAT ELSE MIGHT DETER MOSCOW?
The West imposed sanctions on Russia after the seizure of Crimea and could add painful new measures, such as preventing it from pumping Russian gas through the newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany. Putin would risk a complete rupture of relations with the West if he invaded. It is unclear how far NATO might come to the defence of Ukraine, something that would be fraught with risk for all sides. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but doing nothing would leave the alliance looking irrelevant.
""This is the brinkmanship game that is playing out. Both in NATO in Brussels and in Moscow there will be calculations around where the escalatory steps could lead. If NATO was to deploy to fight ... the Russians would see this as an unbelievable escalation,"" said Puri.
""Whether (Ukraine) ends up as a battleground I think is unlikely - but really that's the issue that Russia and NATO are fencing around at the moment in Ukraine.""",0
214,"ISLAMABAD, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Pakistan's Cabinet on Tuesday granted permission to arch-rival India to use its land route to ship wheat aid to neighbouring Afghanistan where millions of people face hunger as a harsh winter sets in.
Islamabad will also send aid, the prime minister's office said in a statement, including 50,000 metric tons of wheat, matching the level sent by India.
""We have approved to give passage to this 50,000 tons of wheat that India wants to send to Afghanistan,"" Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told a news conference after the Cabinet met with Prime Minister Imran Khan in the chair.
""We think the people in Afghanistan should be helped in any way on humanitarian grounds,"" he said.
New Delhi has not responded to the announcement.
Pakistan has for years denied India commercial or other transport links to Afghanistan. The neighbours have fought three wars since Pakistan was carved out of India in 1947.
The office of Prime Minister Khan in its statement said Islamabad would send humanitarian assistance to Kabul worth 5 billion rupees ($28.65 million) and comprising food commodities, including 50,000 metric tons of wheat, emergency medical supplies, winter shelters and other supplies.
It also said Pakistan would facilitate the return of Afghan patients sent to India for medical treatment.
A combination of conflict, drought and COVID-19 have left millions in Afghanistan, under Taliban rule, facing hunger or starvation.
Food prices have spiked since the second drought in four years ruined some 40% of the wheat crop, the World Food Programme (WFP), a UN body has said.  read more

215,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday he might further scale back guidance on central bank policy and the central bank could return to stating that decisions would be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis.
Speaking to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Bailey reiterated that he was not a fan of the type of 'forward guidance' deployed by his predecessor Mark Carney, and that even existing explanations of the BoE's world view might be too much.
""We will keep under review what I would call the boundary between giving the kind of signal that we gave three weeks ago - which essentially said 'here's our view of the world ... this is what follows from it'.
""There is an alternative view, which is we should go meeting by meeting and not give any guidance. That is not off the table by any means. That is very well trodden ground by the MPC and I could imagine us going back to it.""
Financial markets interpreted remarks made by Bailey in October as a signal that rates would rise this month - something the BoE did not do - rather than as more general guidance that rates were on an upward path.",0
216,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's defense in her sex abuse trial will focus on undermining her accusers and distancing her from Jeffrey Epstein, the financier for whom she is charged with recruiting underage girls, according to legal experts and court filings.
In what is viewed by some legal experts as a risky strategy in the post-#MeToo era, Maxwell's lawyers will question the credibility of four women who say she groomed them as teenagers for Epstein to abuse from the 1990s to the early 2000s, arguing that their memories are faulty or that they are lying because of financial incentives. They have said in a court filing that one woman was motivated by a ""desire for cash.""
Epstein died by suicide at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
""[Maxwell's lawyers] want to say the real villain is no longer around to be prosecuted, so they're using her as a scapegoat,"" said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
Jury selection is underway in Manhattan federal court for Maxwell's trial, with opening statements scheduled for Nov. 29.
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges including sex trafficking.
Her lawyers have argued that prosecutors, unable to convict Epstein because of his death, are seeking to ""substitute"" Maxwell in order to hold someone responsible.
""Left with no fish to attempt to fry, the government belatedly turned to Ms. Maxwell,"" her lawyers wrote in a Feb. 4 filing.
The office of U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan, which is prosecuting the case against Maxwell, declined to comment. Maxwell's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Jeffrey Pagliuca, a lawyer for Maxwell, said at a Nov. 10 hearing that the defense would question the women who say they were abused about why they waited so many years to come forward.
Two of the women - Annie Farmer and another who will testify under a pseudonym - did not accuse Maxwell of wrongdoing until long after Epstein's alleged abuses, according to Maxwell's defense.
A diary Farmer kept in the 1990s describing interactions with Epstein did not mention Maxwell, and the unidentified witness said nothing about Maxwell until June when prosecutors showed her a photograph, the lawyers said.
PSYCHOLOGIST TESTIMONY
The defense will in part rely on the expert testimony of Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist who studies how memories can become distorted over time.
There are risks for the defense team, some lawyers said, particularly since the #MeToo movement in which women accused powerful men of sexual harassment and abuse.
""Victim shaming ... doesn't work especially now in 2021, and it usually hurts you,"" said Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a New York defense attorney who specializes in sex crimes cases. ""You have to show the utmost empathy in my opinion to people who have been victimized.""
Maxwell's defense also has indicated that they intend to argue the women are belatedly accusing Maxwell because of the possibility of a payout.
All four accusers have accepted payment from a victims' compensation fund established by Epstein's estate, Maxwell's attorneys said in a court filing.
""The motive for fabrication could not be clearer,"" Laura Menninger, another Maxwell lawyer, wrote in connection with a civil lawsuit Farmer filed against Epstein's estate. Farmer dropped that case when she sought compensation from the victims' fund.
""Her newly asserted memories of abuse - without corroboration - are not based on the truth or a desire for 'justice' so much as her desire for cash.""
Lawyers for Farmer did not reply to a request for comment.

217,"BARCELONA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A FIFA proposal for a World Cup every two years and changes to the Club World Cup could cost the big domestic soccer leagues and UEFA around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) per season in lost TV rights and match day and commercial agreements, according to  a report commissioned by the leagues.
More frequent international competitions, as well as  additional international club games, could lead to major changes in the national leagues, including a reduction in the number of teams competing in them, a shift from weekend to weekday games, and fewer domestic games, the report said.
The report, compiled by consultancies KPMG and FTI's Delta Partners and seen ahead of publication by Reuters, predicted that in addition to cutting club revenue, such a move would hit viewer interest in games.
It would also reduce advertisers' interest in domestic football and put strains on players, leading to poorer play, it said.
Gianni Infantino, president of soccer's world governing body, said last month that FIFA was discussing holding the World Cup every two years instead of the current four-year cycle.
Arsene Wenger, the former Arsenal manager and FIFA's head of global development, has proposed a new calendar which would see a reduction in the number of international breaks for qualifiers, with one or two longer breaks to compress the qualification process.
He suggested holding World Cups in alternate years with continental championships such as the Euros and the Copa America in between. He is also calling for mandatory rest periods to avoid player burn-out.
However, the idea has run into strong opposition from UEFA, which runs the hugely popular and lucrative Champions League, and from national leagues such Italy's Serie A, Spain's La Liga, and England's Premier League, which have an enormous global following.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has argued that a more frequent World Cup would dilute its value and harm other competitions. He has threatened to lead a European boycott of an additional World Cup.
Wenger, speaking in September, said: ""Until now, club football is 80%, national team football is 20% and I want to keep that balance.""
FIFA has not responded to a Reuters request for comment, but it has previously promised its own feasibility study.
VERY RISKY
The report, which also involves the MLS, Mexico, Japan and South African leagues as well as the European big five, said even the least disruptive options would cost them billions annually.
The biggest hit would be to TV revenues.
It calculated that the 40 biggest domestic leagues around the world and UEFA club competitions like the Champions League stand to lose as much as 5 billion euros per season in audiovisual deals alone - more than a third of what the leagues make in TV rights today.
The study estimates that the leagues would lose more than one billion per year in visual rights due to a decrease of number of matches, 1.75 billion euros due to a shortened calendar, and another 901 million euros for the changes in the schedule, with weekend games being transferred to midweek.
The total revenue in audiovisual rights generated by leagues would drop from more than 14 billion euros to about 9 billion euros, the study predicts.
Enders Analysis senior analyst François Godard said holding a biennial World Cup would be very risky.
""My worry is that at some point demand collapses. The risk of a sudden dramatic drop is huge if you weaken the main product (the national leagues),"" he told Reuters.
""If you change to this new model with a World Cup every two year and games have to be moved from the weekend to midweek and you have a shorter overall season and some players might not be available at some point, you weaken your core product.""
The report said commercial losses would be up to 2.16 billion per season, a drop of about 25%, and the negative impact on match day revenues would cost the clubs 1.2 billion euros, again a drop of about 25%.
It took in various scenarios. But in all of them leagues project that starting from the 2024-25 season, they would be forced to reduce to 18 teams and to finish their seasons in early May to fit FIFA's plans. It was not clear how many matches might be dropped.
The report will be presented at the World Leagues Forum's Annual Meeting next week, said Enrique Bonilla, chairman of the Forum and Liga MX.
""These plans are against leagues, clubs and players,""  Bonilla said.
The 2018 World Cup generated $5.37 billion in revenue for FIFA.
Gross revenue from the 2021/22 UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League and the 2021 UEFA Super Cup is estimated to be 3.5 billion euros.

218,"New Delhi, Nov 23 (Reuters) - India's plan to release 5 million barrels of oil from stockpiles in tandem with releases by other major consumers is unlikely to alter its crude import plans as it is already selling less from the caverns than its target, a government official said.
The United States said on Tuesday it was releasing millions of barrels from its strategic reserves in tandem with India and other countries. The timing was not specified.
India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 84% of its oil needs and has strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) to store up to 5 million tonnes, or about 37 million barrels of oil, to protect against supply disruptions.
The government official, who asked not to be named, said the release from India's strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) was ""a symbolic gesture"" as it needed to create space as part of efforts to make money from renting out the storage and was already selling the oil.
India has repeatedly raised concerns over rising oil prices and wants the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+ to increase output more quickly.
The country will sell 5 million barrels, equivalent to one day of its oil demand, to Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL.NS) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL.NS).
India last year filled the storage with cheap oil and earlier this year overhauled its SPR policy to commercialise half of the storage and lease space to Indian and foreign companies.
To obtain enough space for its plan, India has to sell about 13 million barrels oil as 5.5 million barrels of space is already leased to Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.
Since sales began in August, Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL), which manages the federal reserves, has sold about 5 million barrels from the caverns, a second source said.",0

JUNK-RATED CORPORATE DEBT GROWTH OUTPACES INVESTMENT GRADE (1210 EST/1710 GMT)
Corporate debt rated BB-plus or lower by S&P Global Ratings grew by 7.9% to $5.58 trillion in the first half of 2021, outpacing growth of 1.6% for investment-grade debt, the credit rating agency reported this week.
Overall growth of S&P-rated global financial and nonfinancial corporate debt, including bonds, notes, loans, revolving credit facilities, and preferred securities, slowed to 3.1% from 3.8% in 2020's first half ""when issuers raised unprecedented funding to bolster liquidity and bridge operations in response to COVID-19,"" the report said.
The amount of corporate debt S&P rates grew by more than $684 billion at $22.8 trillion by July 1 with 76% rated in the investment-grade category at BBB-minus or higher.
The largest increases were for debt rated in the BBB and B categories, which jumped by $384.5 billion and $265 billion respectively, due in part to rating upgrades.
Growth in B-rated debt was fueled by a surge in leveraged finance issuance, as well as rating upgrades of more than 80 issuers to the B level from the CCC level in the first half of 2021, S&P reported.

A GREEN FUTURE: PRIVATE FINANCE AND GETTING RETAIL INVESTORS INVOLVED (1118 EST/1618 GMT)
As the dust settles on COP26, there is a lot that has been said on what it means for governments, companies and investors, but the consensus view was that trillions of dollars worth of funding need to be mobilized to have meaningful hope of averting the worst of climate change, and that the private sector is key.
It stands to reason that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is looking to beef up the amount of private capital it can help put to work on its projects.
Ludger Schuknecht, vice president and corporate secretary of the AIIB, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) the AIIB's securitization program was ""well subscribed"", adding that about a third of participation was from outside Asia itself.
""If you look at the spreads, over six months liable for the Class A, the AAA-rated one, in the 120-125 basis point range...So, a good return for those investors who wanted high rated bonds and a good amount.""
Schuknecht said the bank was even ""trying to create an environment for retail investors to also invest in the climate space,"" which he added would be a first in Asia.
While climate finance was earlier closely linked with debt markets and more specifically green bonds earlier, COP26 seems to have cemented the belief among many investors across the capital structure that money needs to be allocated in a more environmentally aware manner.
""Interest is across the range of solutions – discretionary portfolios, liquid and illiquid funds, structured products, direct deals,"" Damian Payiatakis, Head of Sustainable & Impact Investing at Barclays Private Bank, told the GMF.
""For many investors, the entry points tend to be into investments where they are already active and familiar. If I take a step back, sustainability is the next stage of investing, not simply the latest product or trend,"" Payiatakis added.

A SMALLER PIECE OF PUMPKIN PIE: MARKIT SHOWS EXPANSION SLOWDOWN (1054 EST/1554 GMT)
A lone economic indicator released on Tuesday suggests the growth of business activity in the United States has lost some momentum.
While the manufacturing sector's (USMPMP=ECI) expansion accelerated slightly, growth in services (USMPSP=ECI) - which accounts for a larger slice of the total pie - unexpectedly applied the brakes, according to global information firm HIS Markit.
Markit's preliminary ""flash"" purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November delivered 59.1 reading for goods makers, a 0.7 point increase over October. But the services print defied consensus by dropping 1.7 points to an even 57, two points lower than expected.
Taken together, the composite number shed 0.9 points to 56.9.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates monthly expansion.
While the U.S. economy has essentially re-opened for business, with see-sawing demand for goods versus customer facing services approaching some semblance of equanimity, the supply side of the equation remains in intensive care as shortages of materials and workers continue to constrain activity.
""The slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints"" writes Chris Williamson, Markit's chief business economist. ""Input cost inflation spiked sharply higher in November to reach a new survey high, adding to pressure for firms to pass the recent surge in costs on to customers in order to protect margins.""
""Average prices charged for goods and services continued to rise at an unprecedented rate,” Williamson adds.
Compared with global rivals, U.S. and European factory activity expansion is essentially neck-and-neck, with merchandise producers across the pond outpacing the U.S. in output and headcount, but stateside producers enjoying faster growth in new orders.
And since the end of the pandemic recession - the deepest and shortest economic contraction on record - China has been a clear laggard.
On Wednesday, investors will be treated to a veritable traffic jam of indicators as the markets hightail it out of town to accommodate the Thanksgiving holiday.
On tap for tomorrow are (deep breath), mortgage demand, corporate profits, durable goods, GDP, consumer spending, PCE inflation, jobless claims, inventories, new home sales and consumer sentiment.
As for Wall Street, a lack of meaningful market-moving catalysts exerted its gravitational pull on the major stock indexes, with the benchmark S&P 500 on the road to its third straight day in the red.
Energy (.SPNY) is the outlier on the upside, with spiking crude prices  boosting the sector sharply higher.

LIRA IN CRISIS AGAIN, BUT NOT A GLOBAL CONTAGION JUST YET (0917 EST/1417 GMT)
After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

222,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Detroit's Big Three automakers are not yet mandating vaccines for thousands of unionized workers even as they said in a joint statement with the United Auto Workers on Tuesday that they will extend requirements for workers to wear masks at work sites.
General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N), Chrysler-parent Stellantis  and the UAW said they have agreed that unionized auto workers will be asked to report vaccination status on a voluntary basis, but not as a requirement. They also agreed to continue mask requirements at work sites.
The White House wants employers to mandate vaccinations.
Labor Department rules issued Nov. 5 requiring all companies with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccines or regular testing by Jan. 4 for nearly all employees have been put on hold by a federal appeals court. On Tuesday, the Biden administration asked a court to lift the stay.
""Vaccination requirements work. They’re implementable without disruptions. And they boost — they boost dramatically vaccination rates,"" White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said on Monday.
The UAW has resisted suggestions it agree to vaccine mandates.
UAW President Ray Curry in September told members that ""until the various rules described above are finalized, the UAW’s bargaining position continues to be that vaccination is strongly encouraged, but a personal choice.""
Biden has worked hard to win the autoworkers’ support, in part because UAW members are crucial to winning elections in Michigan and other Midwestern states.
But the UAW’s reluctance to support vaccination mandates reflects a broader resistance among many unions to the Biden administration’s policies.
Last week, Stellantis said it would require all of its 14,000 U.S. salaried non-union employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 5, as it prepares for a phased reopening of its U.S. offices next year.
Most, but not all, of the salaried workforce of U.S. automakers is not unionized.
Nearly 80% of its salaried non-union U.S. workforce self-reported that they are fully vaccinated, Stellantis said.
Earlier this month, Ford said it would require most of its 32,000-strong U.S. salaried workforce to be vaccinated.
The second largest U.S. automaker earlier this month said more than 84% of U.S. salaried employees already are vaccinated.
Ford said earlier it was still evaluating its policy for ""manufacturing locations, parts depots and Ford Credit, including analyzing federal and collective bargaining requirements.""
GM, Ford and Stellantis said last month they would mandate vaccines for all autoworkers in Canada. GM declined to say Friday if it would require vaccines for U.S. salaried employees.",0

224,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday touted his administration's international and domestic efforts to tackle inflation and high gasoline prices, promising Americans a drop in prices at the pump 'before long.""
The Democratic president announced what he called the largest-ever release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to boost domestic supplies, in coordination with other countries. The White House is also probing possible illegal conduct by oil and gasoline companies that it says are keeping gas prices artificially high.
""I told you before that we're going to take action on these problems. That's exactly what we're doing,"" Biden said in remarks broadcast from the White House.
""It will take time, but before long you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank, and in the longer-term we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy.""
Biden's administration along with the Federal Reserve had described sharp spikes in inflation earlier this year as transitory, but pressure for action has grown as the price surges have continued into the fall.
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier this month that U.S. consumer prices in October posted their biggest annual gain in 31 years, driven by large jumps in the cost of gasoline and other goods.
Biden acknowledged the pain Americans were feeling, but said his administration was working to clear logjams in supply chains, speed up work at U.S. ports and work with retailers to ensure that store shelves were stocked with ""everything from bicycles to ice skates"" in time for the winter holidays.
The White House on Tuesday announced plans to release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain to cool prices after producers in the OPEC+ group repeatedly ignored calls for more crude.
Biden also took aim at companies that he said were making record profits while failing to pass savings along to consumers.
""If the gap between wholesale and retail gas prices was in line with past averages, Americans would be paying at least 25 cents less per gallon right now,"" he said. ""Instead, companies are pocketing the difference as profit, and that's unacceptable.""
Biden last week said there was mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies that is keeping fuel prices elevated, asking the Federal Trade Commission to dig deeper into possible ""illegal conduct"" in the market.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday also highlighted the administration's call for the Federal Maritime Commission to ensure free and fair competition and prevent ""outsized profits"" for ocean carriers, saying new data showed companies in that sector made nine times more in profits in the third quarter compared to last year.",0

226,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday ruled that the administrators of Jeffrey Epstein's victims' compensation fund must provide records of claims made by women who accuse Ghislaine Maxwell of playing a role in their having been sexually abused.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan rejected requests by the fund's administrators and by federal prosecutors to quash the subpoena for the records by Maxwell's lawyers. Nathan will review the materials Maxwell wants to see before deciding which can be turned over.
The subpoena is part of the defense effort to question the credibility of accusers linking Maxwell to Epstein's alleged abuses. Maxwell's lawyers have repeatedly said the accusers are motivated by financial incentives to lie or exaggerate.
Prosecutors have charged Maxwell, 59, with recruiting and grooming four underage girls for financier Epstein to abuse from 1994 to 2004. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges. Her trial is scheduled to begin on Nov. 29.
Attorneys for the British socialite have said four accusers expected to testify against her have made claims to the fund, which paid out more than $121 million to about 138 people.
The defense sought records from the fund related to payments to the women and statements they made, court records show. Prosecutors called the records irrelevant.

229,"GENEVA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A global licence for serological technology that detects COVID-19 antibodies will be provided royalty-free to poor and middle-income countries under a first of its kind agreement to boost production, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday.
The existing four tests, which check for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies developed after either an infection or a vaccine dose, could also inform decisions on the need for boosters to protect against the disease, it said in a statement.
The non-exclusive licensing agreement reached with the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), a public research institute offering the technology as a global public good, is the first test licence signed by the WHO's Medicines Patent Pool (MPP).
""The aim of the licence is to facilitate the rapid manufacture and commercialisation of CSIC’s COVID-19 serological test worldwide,"" the WHO said.
""The licence will be royalty-free for low- and middle-income countries and will remain valid until the date the last patent expires,"" it said.
The tests are simple to use and suitable for even rural  settings with a basic laboratory infrastructure, it added.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the deal which he hoped would inspire other developers to share tools against COVID-19 which has killed 5.4 million people since the virus emerged in central China in December 2019.
""This is the kind of open and transparent licence we need to move the needle on access during and after the pandemic,"" Tedros said.
""I urge developers of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics to follow this example and turn the tide on the pandemic and on the devastating global inequity this pandemic has spotlighted.""
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) welcomed the deal, noting that currently WHO only had one antibody test using quantitative immunoassays (ELISA) made by Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) which can only be used with the Swiss-based drugmaker’s own device.
“In order to overcome the monopoly of large diagnostics companies such as Roche, and to facilitate production and supply of reliable ELISA antibody tests in all countries, the open licence from CSIC to WHO C-TAP (COVID-19 Technology Access Pool) is an important step forward,” the activist group said.
“However, one licence from one technology owner is not enough to open up the full platform so that developers in countries can improve their tests for COVID-19 antibodies. Removing intellectual property barriers on all key technology components, and facilitating open sharing, pooling and transferring of technologies, data and know-how, are important to guarantee and improve access to COVID-19 diagnostics for all.""",0

But a user cartel of sorts is a direct response to the one that exists for suppliers, and could have some important impact in the long run.
The total amount of oil that will be released from all of the countries could exceed 70 million barrels, according to research outfit Rystad Energy. BP (BP.L) said earlier this month that global oil demand is above 100 million barrels per day, so the effort cobbles together less than a day’s worth of oil. And the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have about 7 million  read more  barrels of spare capacity daily. Should oil-producing nations decide, they could counteract the released supply in less than two weeks.
Still the nations that unveiled the effort on Tuesday represent about 50% of world oil demand, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. They cannot just stop using oil, or force their constituents to curtail it. So controlling demand over the short run is hard. But controlling supply has proven difficult, too. Though OPEC sets limits, countries that are members often pump more oil than their allotted amount.
And over the longer term, economies are more flexible. Governments can encourage the growth of alternatives such as electric cars. Moreover, OPEC predicts China and India to drive about 40% of increased global energy demand this decade, and American’s love of gas guzzlers isn’t going anywhere for now. Ford Motor, Dodge, and Chevrolet pick-up trucks are still by far the most popular vehicles in the United States, according to Car and Driver.
Still few businesses can stand losing their biggest clients over the long run, and that goes for OPEC, too. China, India and the United States individually might have some power to change the global energy dynamic, but a cartel that works together to reduce demand through researching and subsidizing the development and deployment of alternative technologies, which would presumably spread worldwide, could be powerful indeed.

234,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - New York's highest court ruled on Tuesday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is entitled to insurance coverage for $140 million of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement with the former Bear Stearns Cos over improper mutual fund trading.
Reversing a lower court ruling, the Court of Appeals ruled 6-1 that the $140 million derived from estimates of wrongful customer profits and investor harm, and was not a ""penalty"" that would excuse JPMorgan's insurers from providing coverage.
Bear Stearns had agreed in 2006 to pay a $90 million civil fine and give up $160 million of ill-gotten gains to resolve SEC charges it let favored hedge fund customers conduct market timing and late trading from 1999 to 2003.
Market timing involved rapid trading in violation of funds' rules and at the expense of ordinary investors, while late trading involved illegal after-hours trading at stale prices.
Banks, mutual fund firms and individuals paid billions of dollars to settle regulatory probes of the practices, which were first highlighted in 2003 by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan bought in 2008, had sought insurance coverage for $140 million of the disgorgement, excluding $20 million of revenue it had generated from the improper trading.
Insurers, including Lloyd's of London, Travelers and Vigilant, said the $140 million did not represent client gains under the policies, and that public policy made the amount uninsurable.
Chief Judge Janet DiFiore, however, wrote for Tuesday's majority that the insurers failed to show that Bear Stearns could have reasonably believed its policies precluded coverage.
She also said that unlike the fine, which Bear Stearns was required to treat as a penalty for tax purposes, the $140 million served a ""compensatory"" rather than a punitive goal.
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the largest U.S. bank was pleased with the decision. Lawyers for the insurers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

236,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A new Mexican government measure to expedite infrastructure projects aims to streamline bureaucracy, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday amid criticism that the step would undermine the public tender process.
Infrastructure projects of ""public interest and national security"" can be authorized by the federal government, according to guidelines published Monday in the official gazette.
Provisional authorization will be issued within five days of when applications for a project are submitted in order to ""guarantee their timely execution,"" it states.
Under the measure, federal agencies can grant such authorizations and licenses for telecommunications, tourism, railways, ports, airports and other infrastructure projects that are considered ""priority or strategic for national development.""
Critics contend the new guidelines would make spending on public works less transparent.
Lopez Obrador defended the measure, saying it would facilitate internal cooperation, and declared that the federal government was guided by justice and honesty.
""This has nothing to do with transparency. The ministries, we're all held accountable,"" he told a regular news conference.",0
237,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators intend to clarify in 2022 what role traditional banks can legally play in the cryptocurrency market, they said on Tuesday.
In a statement, regulators said they plan to make clear what sort of activities banks can engage in involving cryptocurrency, including holding it on their balance sheets, issuing stablecoins and holding crypto assets and facilitating crypto trading on behalf of customers, among other currently murky areas.
The joint statement from the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an update on work done by an interagency ""sprint"" team convened earlier this year.
While not providing details, the agencies said the rapid growth of cryptocurrency presents ""potential opportunities and risks"" for traditional banks. They said regulators want to provide ""coordinated and timely"" clarity to the institutions they monitor.
""The agencies have identified a number of areas where additional public clarity is warranted,"" the agencies said. ""Throughout 2022, the agencies plan to provide greater clarity on whether certain activities related to crypto-assets conducted by banking organizations are legally permissible, and expectations for safety and soundness, consumer protection, and compliance with existing laws and regulations.""
Agency officials have been working on identifying risks facing banks engaging in crypto activity, as well as whether existing regulations must be updated to account for that activity.",0
238,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Two Republicans on the Federal Trade Commission asked the White House on Tuesday to disclose any ""mounting evidence"" of wrongdoing behind high retail gasoline prices after President Joe Biden urged the agency to dig deeper into possible ""illegal conduct"" in the market.
FTC Commissioners Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson asked the administration to share the evidence ""so that we might consider how to proceed.""
Last week, Biden told FTC Chair Lina Khan there was ""mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies"" and he urged the commission to ""further examine what is happening with oil and gas markets.""
“I do not accept hard-working Americans paying more for gas because of anti-competitive or otherwise potentially illegal conduct,” Biden said in a letter to Khan.  read more 
The White House said in a statement that the price at the pump normally moves with the price of wholesale gasoline.
""But recently there has been a split where the price of refined gas is going down but prices at the pump are going up. The split is now nearly 30 cents larger than its historical average,"" a White House official said.
The two Republican commissioners said they shared the concern of all Americans about current gasoline prices, but noted the FTC had been asked to probe gasoline prices during previous administrations and found no evidence of collusion or other illegal behavior.
""The FTC has a long history of studying the oil and gas industries,"" they wrote. ""For example, our agency's work has highlighted the fact that prices at the pump may not correlate immediately with the price of crude.""
Crude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs and although they are still some way short of levels reached between 2011 and 2014, when they broke through $100 a barrel, many consumers are feeling the pain of a dramatic increase from a year ago.
The United States said on Tuesday it would release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, to try to cool prices after OPEC+ producers repeatedly ignored calls for more crude.  read more 
Biden said the move would help lower gasoline prices.
""I told you before that we're going to take action on these problems. That's exactly what we're doing,"" Biden said in remarks broadcast from the White House.
""It will take time, but before long you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank,"" he said.",0
239,"SEOUL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, whose iron-fisted rule of the country following a 1979 military coup sparked massive democracy protests, died on Tuesday at the age of 90, his former press aide said.
A former military commander, Chun presided over the 1980 Gwangju army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators, a crime for which he was later convicted and received a commuted death sentence.
Chun passed away at his Seoul home early in the morning and his body was moved to a hospital for a funeral later in the day.
He was sufferig from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer which was in remission, and his health had deteriorated recently, his former press secretary Min Chung-ki told reporters.
President Moon Jae-in's office offered condolences to Chun's family but expressed regret over his failure to reveal the truth and provide apologies. It had no plan to send flowers or an official to his funeral home, Moon's spokeswoman said.
Chun's death came about a month after coup co-conspirator and succeeding President Roh Tae-woo, who played a crucial but controversial role in the country's troubled transition to democracy, died at age 88.
An aloof, ramrod-straight Chun during his mid-1990s trial defended the coup as necessary to save the nation from a political crisis and denied sending troops into Gwangju.
""I am sure that I would take the same action, if the same situation arose,"" Chun told the court.
Chun was born on March 6, 1931, in Yulgok-myeon, a poor farming town in the southeastern county of Hapcheon, during Japanese rule over Korea.
He joined the military straight out of high school, working his way up the ranks until he was appointed a commander in 1979. Taking charge of the investigation into the assassination of President Park Chung-hee that year, Chun courted key military allies and gained control of South Korea's intelligence agencies to headline a Dec. 12 coup.
""In front of the most powerful organisations under the Park Chung-hee presidency, it surprised me how easily (Chun) gained control over them and how skilfully he took advantage of the circumstances. In an instant he seemed to have grown into a giant,"" Park Jun-kwang, Chun's subordinate during the coup later told journalist Cho Gab-je.
Chun's eight-year rule in the presidential Blue House was characterised by brutality and political repression. It was, however, also marked by growing economic prosperity.
Chun resigned from office amid a nationwide student-led democratic movement in 1987 demanding a direct electoral system.
In 1995, he was charged with mutiny, treason and was arrested after refusing to appear at the prosecutors' office and  fleeing to his hometown.
At what local media dubbed the ""trial of the century"", he and Roh were found guilty of mutiny, treason and bribery. In their verdict, judges said Chun's rise to power came ""through illegal means which inflicted enormous damage on the people"".
Thousands of students were believed to have been killed at Gwangju, according to testimonies by survivors, former military officers and investigators.
Roh was given a lengthy jail term while Chun was sentenced to death. However, that was commuted by the Seoul High Court in recognition of Chun's role in the fast-paced economic development of the Asian ""Tiger"" economy and the peaceful transfer of the presidency to Roh in 1988.
Both men were pardoned and freed from jail in 1997 by President Kim Young-sam, in what he called an effort to promote ""national unity.""
An association of survivors' groups said at a news conference on Tuesday that it was lamentable that Chun died without apologising for the coup and Gwangju ""massacre,"" vowing to continue seeking the truth and ""justice of history.""
Chun made several returns to the spotlight. He caused a national furore in 2003 when he claimed total assets of 291,000 won ($245) of cash, two dogs and some home appliances - while owing some 220.5 billion won in fines. His four children and other relatives were later found to own large swaths of land in Seoul and luxurious villas in the United States.
Chun's family in 2013 vowed to pay off the bulk of his debt, but his unpaid fines still totalled some 100 billion won as of last December. Seoul city said last week that his unpaid taxes exceeded 980 million won.
In 2020, Chun was found guilty and received an eight-month suspended sentence for defaming a late democracy activist and Catholic priest in his 2017 memoirs. Prosecutors have appealed, and Chun had faced a trial next week. 
Chun had wished to be cremated and buried near the border with North Korea, but his family would make a final decision when his youngest son, living in the United States, arrives, Min said.

240,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - While President Joe Biden on Monday said he would renominate U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, he left Washington guessing as to who would become the Fed's new regulatory chief.
Last month, Republican appointee Randal Quarles stepped down from that powerful role overseeing the country's largest lenders, and is due to leave the central bank next month. Biden said that and other Fed picks would be announced in early December.  read more 
Analysts and Washington insiders had seen fellow Fed governor Lael Brainard as the leading candidate to replace Quarles because she opposed his agenda to revisit rules created following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. However, she is stepping into the Fed Vice Chair role.  read more 
Progressives are pushing for a candidate who would take a tougher stance on Wall Street, although it is unclear if they will get their way. Here are the leading names in the mix, according to multiple analysts and Washington insiders.
NELLIE LIANG, TREASURY UNDER-SECRETARY
Currently Treasury under secretary for domestic finance and a former Fed official, Liang was instrumental in building the post-crisis regulatory framework. She spent decades at the Fed as a staffer, ultimately becoming its first director of the Division of Financial Stability following the financial crisis.
She left the central bank in 2017 to join the think tank Brookings Institution, where she criticized Republican efforts to trim capital and liquidity requirements for large banks, among other changes.
Liang had previously been nominated for a Fed board seat by former President Donald Trump, but she withdrew in 2019 after Republicans blocked her nomination over worries she would be too tough on Wall Street.
""We would expect her to tighten big bank oversight, but she also strikes us as pragmatic, which may not work for progressives,"" wrote Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group.
A spokesperson for Liang declined to comment.
SARAH BLOOM RASKIN, FORMER OBAMA OFFICIAL
A former Fed governor and Treasury official, Raskin is supported by progressives but could also secure enough Senate votes, said Seiberg.
As a Fed governor from 2010 to 2014, Raskin slammed proprietary trading as of “low or no real economic value” and pushed for a strict interpretation of the “Volcker Rule,” a major post-crisis reform curbing such speculative investments.
Former President Barack Obama later tapped Raskin to serve as deputy Treasury secretary. She also spent time as the top financial regulator for Maryland before joining the Fed.
However, Raskin recently took on a new role at Duke Law, where she has taught since 2017. She will become faculty director of the law school's Global Financial Markets Center next year. Raskin declined to comment.
RAPHAEL BOSTIC, ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT
With his appointment as President of the Atlanta Fed in 2017, Bostic became the first Black person to hold a regional Fed president role. He has been outspoken on racial diversity and economic inequality issues, both of which are key policy priorities for the Biden administration.
An economist by training, Bostic previously held roles at the Fed in Washington, where he won praise for his work on community lending rules, and at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
However, Bostic ""represents a bit of an unknown regarding financial regulation,"" wrote Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel Financial Corp.
In an interview on Bloomberg Television on Monday, Bostic said he had ""no trips to Washington"" on his calendar and that any decision on such an appointment was out of his hands.
A spokesperson for Bostic declined to comment.
MICHAEL HSU, MEHRSA BARADARAN
Currently Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Hsu previously led big bank supervision at the Fed. As acting Comptroller, he has pushed Democratic priorities, including climate change risk and has warned banks against ""over-confidence"" coming out of the pandemic.
While he would be a good fit for Fed supervision, Washington insiders said, the nominee to replace him as permanent Comptroller, Saule Omarova, may not secure enough Senate votes after some moderate Democrats expressed concerns over her academic work. That means the White House may need Hsu to stick around.
Baradaran, an academic and expert on financial inclusion, is loved by progressives who pushed her for as Comptroller. But the White House passed her over due to concerns among the industry and moderate lawmakers, some of whom said she did not have sufficient experience in government.
A spokeswoman for Hsu declined to comment, and Baradaran did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A GREEN FUTURE: PRIVATE FINANCE AND GETTING RETAIL INVESTORS INVOLVED (1118 EST/1618 GMT)
As the dust settles on COP26, there is a lot that has been said on what it means for governments, companies and investors, but the consensus view was that trillions of dollars worth of funding need to be mobilized to have meaningful hope of averting the worst of climate change, and that the private sector is key.
It stands to reason that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is looking to beef up the amount of private capital it can help put to work on its projects.
Ludger Schuknecht, vice president and corporate secretary of the AIIB, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) the AIIB's securitization program was ""well subscribed"", adding that about a third of participation was from outside Asia itself.
""If you look at the spreads, over six months liable for the Class A, the AAA-rated one, in the 120-125 basis point range...So, a good return for those investors who wanted high rated bonds and a good amount.""
Schuknecht said the bank was even ""trying to create an environment for retail investors to also invest in the climate space,"" which he added would be a first in Asia.
While climate finance was earlier closely linked with debt markets and more specifically green bonds earlier, COP26 seems to have cemented the belief among many investors across the capital structure that money needs to be allocated in a more environmentally aware manner.
""Interest is across the range of solutions – discretionary portfolios, liquid and illiquid funds, structured products, direct deals,"" Damian Payiatakis, Head of Sustainable & Impact Investing at Barclays Private Bank, told the GMF.
""For many investors, the entry points tend to be into investments where they are already active and familiar. If I take a step back, sustainability is the next stage of investing, not simply the latest product or trend,"" Payiatakis added.

A SMALLER PIECE OF PUMPKIN PIE: MARKIT SHOWS EXPANSION SLOWDOWN (1054 EST/1554 GMT)
A lone economic indicator released on Tuesday suggests the growth of business activity in the United States has lost some momentum.
While the manufacturing sector's (USMPMP=ECI) expansion accelerated slightly, growth in services (USMPSP=ECI) - which accounts for a larger slice of the total pie - unexpectedly applied the brakes, according to global information firm HIS Markit.
Markit's preliminary ""flash"" purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November delivered 59.1 reading for goods makers, a 0.7 point increase over October. But the services print defied consensus by dropping 1.7 points to an even 57, two points lower than expected.
Taken together, the composite number shed 0.9 points to 56.9.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates monthly expansion.
While the U.S. economy has essentially re-opened for business, with see-sawing demand for goods versus customer facing services approaching some semblance of equanimity, the supply side of the equation remains in intensive care as shortages of materials and workers continue to constrain activity.
""The slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints"" writes Chris Williamson, Markit's chief business economist. ""Input cost inflation spiked sharply higher in November to reach a new survey high, adding to pressure for firms to pass the recent surge in costs on to customers in order to protect margins.""
""Average prices charged for goods and services continued to rise at an unprecedented rate,” Williamson adds.
Compared with global rivals, U.S. and European factory activity expansion is essentially neck-and-neck, with merchandise producers across the pond outpacing the U.S. in output and headcount, but stateside producers enjoying faster growth in new orders.
And since the end of the pandemic recession - the deepest and shortest economic contraction on record - China has been a clear laggard.
On Wednesday, investors will be treated to a veritable traffic jam of indicators as the markets hightail it out of town to accommodate the Thanksgiving holiday.
On tap for tomorrow are (deep breath), mortgage demand, corporate profits, durable goods, GDP, consumer spending, PCE inflation, jobless claims, inventories, new home sales and consumer sentiment.
As for Wall Street, a lack of meaningful market-moving catalysts exerted its gravitational pull on the major stock indexes, with the benchmark S&P 500 on the road to its third straight day in the red.
Energy (.SPNY) is the outlier on the upside, with spiking crude prices  boosting the sector sharply higher.

CAN WALL STREET STAGE A COMEBACK? (1015 EST/1515 GMT)
After opening as a mixed bag Wall Street's three major averages managed to turn positive in Tuesday's early trading after U.S. HIS Markit data showed U.S. business activity slowed moderately in November amid labor shortages and raw material delays, contributing to soaring prices halfway through the fourth quarter.  read more 
However, the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) were less sure of themselves, and have quickly dipped back into the red.
At last glance there were four modestly declining sectors with tech (.SPLRCT) off most. Communications services (.SPLRCL), consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and healthcare (.SPXHC) are down.
The energy sector (.SPNY) is the benchmark's biggest percentage gainer as oil gained ground to steady near $80 a barrel after the United States announced plans to release up to 50 million barrels of oil from its reserves to cool the market.
Markets are also still digesting Monday's news that Jerome Powell was nominated for a second term as Fed Chair and the fact that expectations were pushed forward on Monday for an interest rate hike by as soon as June 2022 compared with the previous expectation for July.  read more

LIRA IN CRISIS AGAIN, BUT NOT A GLOBAL CONTAGION JUST YET (0917 EST/1417 GMT)
After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

242,"PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Gunshots were fired overnight at police in the French Caribbean island of Martinique, local authorities said on Tuesday, in a sign that unrest triggered by COVID-19 curbs that has rocked the nearby island of Guadeloupe could be spreading there.
No police have been injured and things have calmed down in the daytime, a Martinique police official said, but traffic was still slowed by barricades.
Gunfire has also targeted police over the past few days in Guadeloupe, where a general strike entered a second week on Monday and many stores remained shuttered after night-time looting amid protests over the COVID-19 restrictions.
The situation remains ""very difficult"" in Guadeloupe, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told France Inter radio earlier in the day.
""There are still scenes of extreme violence with police forces being shot at with real ammunition,"" he said, adding that some 200 additional police officers deployed since Sunday had helped to quell some of the unrest.
People in Guadeloupe and Martinique have been especially incensed by a requirement, also in force in mainland France, for all healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Compulsory vaccination has touched a nerve in a population that is descended from slaves who worked on French sugar plantations. During the 20th century, many people on Guadeloupe were also systematically exposed to toxic pesticides used in banana plantations.  read more 
A general strike also began in Martinique on Monday to demand an end to the mandatory vaccination of health workers and for action to tackle high fuel prices.

244,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa said on Tuesday that ""nascent progress"" toward getting all parties to Ethiopia's conflict into negotiations on a ceasefire risks being outpaced by an ""alarming"" increase in military operations.
Envoy Jeffrey Feltman briefed reporters in Washington after returning on Monday from Ethiopia, where he met Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed and discussed a potential diplomatic solution to the year-old conflict, which has killed thousands and displaced millions in Africa's second most populous nation.
Both Abiy and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the political party controlling the northern region of Tigray, seem to believe they are on the cusp of military victory, Feltman said.
""There is some nascent progress in trying to get the parties to move from a military confrontation to a negotiating process,"" Feltman said. ""What concerns us is this fragile progress risks being outpaced by the alarming developments on the ground that threaten Ethiopia's overall stability and unity.""
Abiy's spokesperson, Billene Seyoum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda could not immediately be reached for comment.
War broke out in November 2020 in Tigray between Ethiopian federal troops and the TPLF. In July, the conflict spread into two neighboring regions in northern Ethiopia.
Feltman said both sides were talking to the United States about beginning a discreet peace process, and said that the key desires of both sides were not mutually exclusive.
The TPLF wants what the U.N. calls a ""de facto government blockade"" to be lifted and humanitarian aid to be allowed into Tigray, where 400,000 people are living in famine; Abiy wants the Tigrayan forces to withdraw from captured territory.
But the TPLF has also called on Abiy, who won a landslide victory in national elections this year, to step down.
Although Feltman said he discussed diplomatic solutions with Abiy, the Ethiopian leader expressed confidence he could achieve his goals militarily.
Abiy had posted a statement on Twitter on Monday promising to lead from the frontlines on Tuesday.
""I will head to the frontline to lead the defense forces  personally,"" he wrote. ""Let's meet at the war front ... the time has come to lead the country with sacrifice.""
Tigrayan forces and their allies have threatened to march on the capital, but have also been fighting fiercely to try to cut a transport corridor linking landlocked Ethiopia with the region's main port Djibouti.
Feltman said the Ethiopian military and regional militias had been able to ""more or less stem"" the Tigrayan moves to cut the corridor but Tigrayan forces had been able to move south towards Addis.
Ethiopia's military spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
""For a while the lines were static, and then about a week ago the ...(Tigrayan forces) started to move again,"" Feltman said. ""It alarms us for several reasons.""
If Tigrayan forces move closer to Addis, they might increase their demands, Feltman said.
""We are absolutely opposed to the (Tigrayan forces) threatening Addis by cutting off the road to Djibouti or threatening Addis by actually entering Addis,"" Feltman added.

245,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it has filed an antitrust lawsuit aimed at blocking U.S. Sugar Corp from buying rival Imperial Sugar Co (LOUDRI.UL), a deal the government said could drive up the price of sugar for households as well as food and drink makers.
The deal, if it goes forward, would mean that U.S. Sugar, owner and member of a cooperative with three other companies, and another company would have some 75% of refined sugar sales in the U.S. Southeast, the department said.
""U.S. Sugar and Imperial Sugar are already multibillion-dollar corporations and are seeking to further consolidate an already cozy sugar industry,"" said Jonathan Kanter, the new head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.
The two companies often compete head-to-head to win customer contracts, the government said in its 27-page complaint.
U.S. Sugar, however, said the deal would protect American jobs.
""We disagree with the Justice Department’s decision and fully intend to litigate this matter,"" the company said in a statement. ""This transaction will improve supply chain logistics and will not result in higher prices or any harm to customers and consumers. We look forward to making our case in court.""
The other major sugar refiner in the region is American Sugar Refining, which sells under the ""Domino"" brand, the department said.
U.S. Sugar announced in March that it would buy Imperial Sugar from commodities trader Louis Dreyfus Co. The deal is worth about $315 million, the Justice Department said.
Imperial Sugar operates a refinery at Port Wentworth in Savannah, Georgia, and a sugar transfer and liquification facility in Ludlow, Kentucky. It was bought by Louis Dreyfus in 2012 for $78 million. ",0
246,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - A pandemic-spurred demand for flu vaccines in India has surged since a devastating second wave of COVID-19 brought the nation's healthcare system to its knees earlier this year.
Vaccinations against influenza are not very common in India due to a lack of awareness, access and steep prices, and they are also not part of the federal government's universal immunization program that includes polio, tuberculosis and Hepatitis B.
Still, more than 1,000 shots were administered at Manipal Hospital's sites in the tech hub of Bengaluru in southern India between July and September, compared with about 3,000 for all of last year, according to the healthcare provider.
""Initially, everyone thought if you got flu vaccines, COVID-19 won't affect you severely,"" said Dr. Ram Shankar Mishra, director of internal medicine at the Max Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, in the national capital of New Delhi.
Mishra added demand has increased, even as COVID-19 vaccinations gather pace.
Apollo Hospitals (APLH.NS) and Fortis Healthcare (FOHE.NS) are also witnessing higher demand for flu shots, including Abbott India's (ABOT.NS) imported vaccine, Influvac, the private hospital operators told Reuters.
Sales in its vaccine unit rose 42.3% in the financial year ended March, largely due to the  influenza prevention shot, Abbott India disclosed in its annual report.
Delhi resident Deepak Kapoor, 40, said he got both his children, aged 10 years and aged 8 months, a flu vaccine.
""During the second wave, there was a lot of talk about flu vaccines, our pediatrician recommended this and I read a lot of literature about it online.""
Some worried parents also asked if their elderly relatives needed to be given the flu vaccine, pediatricians said.
COSTLY SHOT
However, the price of these shots range between 1,500 and 2,000 Indian rupees ($20-$27), making them inaccessible to a large chunk of India's population. The country's per capita income was $1,900 in 2020, World Bank data showed.
The pandemic-fueled uptick has triggered hopes that demand would stay strong.
""I will be happy to see if the market grows, and I think it should because in these two years, lot of people have become aware of the influenza vaccine,"" said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research.

248,"PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - France recorded more than 30,000 new COVID-19 infections over 24 hours for the first time since August as the pace of infection sped up despite new social distancing measures and a drive to boost vaccinations.
The health ministry reported 30,454 new cases on Tuesday, pushing the cumulative total above 7.45 million and the seven-day moving average of new infections over 20,000 for the first time since Aug. 24.
""Today, we will announce 30,000 cases over 24 hours. That is a very major increase in the infection rate, which shows that we really are, unfortunately, in a fifth wave of the epidemic,"" Health Minister Olivier Veran told lawmakers on Tuesday, flagging the surge ahead of publication of the numbers.
The daily new cases were up 54% compared with last Tuesday and the week-on-week increase in new cases has been well above or nearly at 50% for 11 days in a row.
Last week, France's health regulator said a third dose of vaccines should be extended to everyone aged over 40, and from Nov. 15 the government made mask-wearing compulsory in all primary schools again.
The 30,454 new cases registered in France on Tuesday were the highest level since the 30,920 recorded on Aug. 11. France saw an record of 86,852 new COVID-19 cases per day on Nov. 7, 2020.

252,"BARCELONA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Spain's Catalonia region plans to demand proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test for entry to bars, restaurants and stadiums, while other regions are pushing for similar restrictions to tame rising infection rates.
The latest wave of infections in Spain, which has fully vaccinated a hefty 79% of its population, remains well below levels seen in Austria and the Netherlands, but authorities see the risk of it spiralling rapidly out of control.
Catalan regional government spokesperson Patricia Plaja told reporters the administration would seek judicial approval for the COVID pass to ""reduce the risk of infection and to avoid overloading the health system"".
Mandatory COVID passes, because they are seen as infringing on fundamental civil liberties, require a sign-off from regional courts, whose responses to government requests have been mixed.
Catalonia, an affluent northeastern region, has a 14-day infection rate of 183 cases per 100,000 people, above the Spanish average of 132 and the 150 mark deemed as ""high risk"".
It already requires the COVID pass for entry to nightclubs.
Nationwide occupancy of intensive care beds by COVID patients stands at a modest 5% on average, but some regions such as Catalonia and Aragon are above 11%.
In Navarre, across the Pyrenees from coastal Catalonia, authorities said they would seek court approval on Wednesday for the COVID pass at restaurants and nightclubs during the Christmas holiday season.
After a court in the neighbouring Basque region rejected a petition for COVID passes in restaurants, authorities said they could declare a health emergency if pressure on hospitals worsened.
If approved, the tighter restrictions could dampen Spain's hopes to lure millions of tourists for the holidays, but the government remains upbeat that tourism will reach 66% of pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.

Shares in Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) fell 1.2%, to a two-month low, with the bank seen as the most exposed to Turkey.
BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) of France and Dutch bank ING Groep (INGA.AS) also do business in Turkey and may be hit by a slump in its currency. Italy's UniCredit (CRDI.MI) is in the process of exiting the country.
Spanish banks have by far the largest loan exposure to Turkey among Western lenders at nearly $63 billion, followed by banks in France, Germany, Britain, United States, Japan and Italy, data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows.
Here is a summary of listed European banks' Turkish exposure:
BBVA (BBVA.MC)
The Spanish lender is the most exposed to Turkey. It has commercial and small-and-medium enterprises banking businesses, as well as insurance and corporate and investment banking activities in the country, where it operates through Garanti BBVA (GARAN.IS).
Earlier this month BBVA offered to buy the rest of Garanti for up to 2.25 billion euros ($2.53 billion), taking advantage of a slide in the lira and raising fears in Turkey that foreigners might snap up assets at bargain prices.  read more 
In the full year 2020, its Turkey net attributable profit reached 563 million euros, making it the bank's third largest market after Mexico and Spain. That represents 14.3% of BBVA profits excluding the corporate centre.
Loans and advances to customers in Turkey were 37.3 billion euros in 2020, more than 10% of the group's total and the fourth-largest total after Spain, the United States and Mexico.
Jefferies has a cautious view on BBVA's Turkey performance. It estimates a compound annual growth rate in local currency of 13.5% in 2021-2024, versus the company's ""high-teen"" target. It sees an average cost of risk of around 200 basis points in the same period, above the management target of less than 150 bps.
ING (INGA.AS)
ING does wholesale and retail banking business in Turkey, where it operates through a wholly owned subsidiary.
The country generated a total income of 420 million euros in 2020, making it the Dutch bank's third-biggest market outside Europe after the United States and Australia.
Assets in Turkey stood at around 7.3 billion euros in 2020, or less than 1% out of a total of 937 billion euros.

256,"November 23, 2021 - Providing quality health care is the primary goal of health care organizations and physicians. When internal allegations are made that a physician or other provider has failed to provide quality care, organizations may initiate medical review actions in which a medical review committee will review the bases for the allegations and determine if the action against the provider is necessary.
In response to these actions, providers will often bring lawsuits against the organization or committee, alleging a range of causes of action, from defamation to antitrust suits. In response to these lawsuits and in furtherance of providing for quality medical care, Congress passed federal legislation -- the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (""HCQIA"") -- providing, in part, for immunity on behalf of organizations and committees for their actions during reviews.
The requirements to obtain this immunity and the specific standards organizations must establish in court have been a significant subject of litigation, and organizations can gain insights from understanding how courts have addressed these cases.
The HCQIA is divided into three sections: (1) the professional review section; (2) the National Practitioner Data Bank reporting section; and (3) the section establishing requirements for health care organizations to request information regarding physicians from the National Practitioner Data. The first section of the HCQIA, regarding immunity for actions involved in professional review activities, has resulted in the majority of HCQIA-based litigation.
A professional review action is an action or recommendation by a professional review committee, which is based on the competence or professional conduct of a medical staff member. When professional review committees make recommendations that result in an adverse impact on the privileges of a medical staff member, they have faced liability from the physicians who are the subject of the committee's recommendations.
The HCQIA provides immunity to these professional review committees against liability for their actions related to their professional review when certain requirements are satisfied. HCQIA provides immunity for what are referred to as ""professional review actions.""
To be entitled to HCQIA protection, four elements must be met: the professional review action must be made:
(1) in the reasonable belief that the action is in furtherance of the provision of quality health care;
(2) after reasonable efforts have been made to discover the facts of the matter at issue;
(3)  after sufficient notice and an opportunity to be heard are given to the medical staff member involved; and
(4) in the reasonable belief that the action taken is justified based on the facts discovered.
Unless the recommendation is rebutted by the medical staff member by establishing the committee has, more likely than not, failed to establish one or more of the required elements, there is a presumption that the professional review action is reasonable. The presumption of reasonableness focuses on the knowledge of the review committee at the time the review action was taken and does not consider any findings subsequent to the committee's decision. If the medical staff member is able to rebut the presumption of reasonableness, there is no immunity under HCQIA.
The HCQIA reasonable belief standards have been raised in summary judgement motions by the health care organizations with a high degree of success. Several courts have expressly ruled that whether a health care organization is immune from liability under HCQIA is an issue of law and is not proper to submit before a jury.
In Poliner v. Texas Health Systems, a 2008 case, a large health care system received an adverse decision by a jury on the issue of the reasonable belief standard, resulting in a multimillion-dollar verdict. On appeal, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the verdict, holding that, as a matter of law, the health system had met its burden under the reasonable belief standard and was, therefore, immune from the plaintiff's claims for damages.
Although the second HCQIA element, that of adequate notice, can be an issue in HCQIA immunity cases, the remaining three elements, regarding reasonableness in the belief that the action is in furtherance of quality health care, reasonableness in the investigation of the committee action, and reasonableness that the action is warranted, have received greater attention by courts throughout the country.
In determining whether a medical review committee made its decision under the reasonable belief that its action was in the furtherance of providing quality health care, an objective totality of the circumstances standard is applied.
In Johnson v. Spohn, a 2009 Fifth Circuit case arising from internal complaints made to a review committee that a staff physician had failed to properly care for a patient, resulting in the patient's death, the court applied the totality of the circumstances test and considered whether the medical review committee's decision would result in a decreased likelihood of poor patient care or an increased likelihood of greater patient care.
The court ultimately held that, the committee's action, revoking the physician's treating privileges, met the reasonable belief that the action was in furtherance of the quality health care element, due to the fact that the decision was directly tied to the death of the patient and the substandard level of care provided by the physician to that patient. Summary judgment in favor of the health care organization was ultimately affirmed in the case.
The reasonable belief that the action was in furtherance of the quality health care element is easiest to prove when the review action arises from a malpractice or near-malpractice incident. However, even in review actions not involving malpractice incidents, committees should always view their review decisions within the scope of providing for patient care. The provision of patient care should supersede any other competing interests, such as workplace harmony or cost analyses.
A determinative factor often considered by courts on the element regarding reasonableness in the discovery of information leading to the committee action, is whether information obtained by the committee was given falsely or with a malicious intent. For example, in Colantonio v. Mercy Medical Center, a 2010 case before the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, the appellate court found issues of fact warranting reversal of summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the HCQIA reasonableness in the discovery of information factor.
The case involved the decision by a medical review committee to revoke the treating privileges of a staff physician based on a number of complaints from the medical center's employees that the physician's disruptive behavior was hindering the quality of care provided by the medical center. The physician then brought suit against the medical center for defamation, and the center claimed HCQIA immunity.
On appeal from summary judgment in the medical center's favor, the court reasoned that because the plaintiff had at least raised triable issues of fact regarding the falsity and malicious intent of the allegations made by employees of the center to the medical review committee, based on the personal, opinionated nature of the complaints, the defendant had not satisfied its burden to establish HCQIA immunity as to this element.
It is important for health care organizations to keep detailed logs regarding all efforts taken to discover the facts surrounding HCQIA review actions, particularly when interviewing witnesses with pertinent knowledge of the individual subject to the investigation. Biases and personal opinions of the witnesses should be investigated as well to ensure the reasonableness of the investigation.
The final element required for HCQIA immunity, that the committee reasonably believes the action it took was warranted, is perhaps the least difficult element to establish once the prior elements have already been met. Even if the conclusions of the medical review committee ultimately prove to be incorrect, there is still a presumption that the conclusions reached are reasonable if the prior HCQIA elements have been met.
The key to the final element is whether the action taken by the review committee was tailored to address the harm posed by the individual subject to the investigation. A detailed report discussing the alleged misconduct, the proposed remedial action, and a written justification tethering the two, can aid health organizations should it need to seek HCQIA protection.
While the term ""reasonableness"" may appear vague and subjective to health care organizations and medical review committees trying to approach their review decisions in a manner that will fall under HCQIA immunity, courts have made clear there are certain factors and certain policy goals they are seeking when analyzing the reasonableness of the committee's action. Awareness of these factors and goals can aid organizations to structure their reviews effectively, while ensuring protection for the organization and the committee members.",0

Wen's firm is also re-routing trucks laden with perishable goods and high-demand auto parts across the border into Washington state on a more circuitous route to destinations in Alberta and further east in Ontario and Quebec.
He said the trip takes two extra days for a firm relying on 350 drivers.
The infrastructure and emergency cost of the flood alone has been pegged at more than C$1 billion ($787 million), according to local officials. That does not include the hit to farmers, retailers and other businesses.
Logistics firm Volume Freight said it has secured storage in Vancouver for trapped goods from tires to furniture and is arranging for trucks to haul product from the city to provinces further east, via the United States, a costly endeavor.
""Right now, everyone is sitting and waiting... Everyone's just in limbo,"" said Chief Operating Officer Danica Sabourin, adding even when rail lines reopen, delays will last weeks due to the backlog.

Markit's preliminary ""flash"" purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November delivered 59.1 reading for goods makers, a 0.7 point increase over October. But the services print defied consensus by dropping 1.7 points to an even 57, two points lower than expected.
Taken together, the composite number shed 0.9 points to 56.9.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates monthly expansion.
While the U.S. economy has essentially re-opened for business, with see-sawing demand for goods versus customer facing services approaching some semblance of equanimity, the supply side of the equation remains in intensive care as shortages of materials and workers continue to constrain activity.
""The slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints"" writes Chris Williamson, Markit's chief business economist. ""Input cost inflation spiked sharply higher in November to reach a new survey high, adding to pressure for firms to pass the recent surge in costs on to customers in order to protect margins.""
""Average prices charged for goods and services continued to rise at an unprecedented rate,” Williamson adds.
Compared with global rivals, U.S. and European factory activity expansion is essentially neck-and-neck, with merchandise producers across the pond outpacing the U.S. in output and headcount, but stateside producers enjoying faster growth in new orders.
And since the end of the pandemic recession - the deepest and shortest economic contraction on record - China has been a clear laggard.
On Wednesday, investors will be treated to a veritable traffic jam of indicators as the markets hightail it out of town to accommodate the Thanksgiving holiday.
On tap for tomorrow are (deep breath), mortgage demand, corporate profits, durable goods, GDP, consumer spending, PCE inflation, jobless claims, inventories, new home sales and consumer sentiment.
As for Wall Street, a lack of meaningful market-moving catalysts exerted its gravitational pull on the major stock indexes, with the benchmark S&P 500 on the road to its third straight day in the red.
Energy (.SPNY) is the outlier on the upside, with spiking crude prices  boosting the sector sharply higher.

CAN WALL STREET STAGE A COMEBACK? (1015 EST/1515 GMT)
After opening as a mixed bag Wall Street's three major averages managed to turn positive in Tuesday's early trading after U.S. IHS Markit data showed U.S. business activity slowed moderately in November amid labor shortages and raw material delays, contributing to soaring prices halfway through the fourth quarter.  read more 
However, the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) were less sure of themselves, and have quickly dipped back into the red.
At last glance there were four modestly declining sectors with tech (.SPLRCT) off most. Communications services (.SPLRCL), consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and healthcare (.SPXHC) are down.
The energy sector (.SPNY) is the benchmark's biggest percentage gainer as oil gained ground to steady near $80 a barrel after the United States announced plans to release up to 50 million barrels of oil from its reserves to cool the market.
Markets are also still digesting Monday's news that Jerome Powell was nominated for a second term as Fed Chair and the fact that expectations were pushed forward on Monday for an interest rate hike by as soon as June 2022 compared with the previous expectation for July.  read more

LIRA IN CRISIS AGAIN, BUT NOT A GLOBAL CONTAGION JUST YET (0917 EST/1417 GMT)
After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

260,"ANKARA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Anxious Turks struggled to keep up with a bewildering collapse in their currency and the main opposition party leader said the country was experiencing its darkest ""catastrophe"" as the lira slumped 15% on Tuesday against the dollar.
Tuesday's meltdown follows weeks of steep falls in the lira which have already driven up prices, leaving ordinary Turks reconsidering everything from their holiday plans to weekly grocery shopping.  read more 
""There has not been such a catastrophe in the history of the Republic,"" said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the opposition Republican People's Party, blaming the currency freefall on President Tayyip Erdogan who has led the country since 2003.
""At this point, you are a fundamental national security problem for the Republic of Turkey,"" Kilicdaroglu said.
Erdogan has pressured the central bank to slash interest rates in a move he says will boost exports, investment and jobs, but which critics say will further fuel double-digit inflation and erode the lira, cutting deeply into Turks' earnings.
Shoppers at a central Ankara mall said they could not take their eyes off the lira  rate, which plunged as far as 13.45 to the dollar on Tuesday. A year ago it was 8 to the dollar, last month it reached 9 and last week it hit 10.
""I've become unable to work without following the dollar,"" said 28-year-old advertising agency worker Selin.
""I don't think there is a single day where I don't have to watch my budget, and the calculation changes 100 times by the time I get next month's salary. There is nothing left, including toilet paper, that I buy without thinking carefully.""
Former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, a founding member of Erdogan's ruling, Islamist-rooted AK Party before breaking away to form his own party, described the president's economic measures as ""treason and not ignorance"".
Kilicdaroglu, Davutoglu and some other opposition leaders have announced emergency meetings to discuss the currency after Tuesday's crash - the lira's second biggest fall ever.
'WE ARE SINKING'
Turks took to social media to express dismay. Top trending topics on Twitter were dominated by hashtags on the economy including ""We are sinking"", ""Government resign"" and ""We cannot make ends meet"".
In the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, shop owners burned what appeared to be fake dollars on the street in a symbolic gesture of protest, saying: ""We cannot sleep, we don't know about our future.""
Several people who spoke to Reuters said that as soon as they received their salaries or pensions, they converted them into foreign currency.
""I have asked for an advance on my monthly salary just to convert it into dollars so that I can maintain some sense of value in my earnings,"" said Emirhan Metin, 28, a lawyer in Istanbul. ""It's nearly impossible to focus or talk about anything else at this point.""
Haluk, a 36-year-old freelance film editor, said he was often paid with a lag of six to eight months. ""So the contract I signed last month is worth 20% less today. Who knows how much it will be worth when I get paid six months from now?""
Doruk Akpek, CEO at a menstrual hygiene brand startup, said he tried to keep his savings in dollars and crypto-currency, but added the situation was tougher for those who only had lira.
""There is also a psychological unhappiness, you see the country collapsing in front of your eyes. It impacts the morale and motivation of people,"" Akpek said.",0
261,"ROME, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has vetoed the third Chinese takeover in the country since his government took office in February, an official Hong Kong filing by the rebuffed group showed on Tuesday.
Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical (300316.SZ) said Rome had blocked its attempt to set up a joint venture with the Hong Kong arm of Applied Materials (AMAT.O) to buy the U.S.-based group's screen printing equipment business in Italy.
The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Nov. 18, two government sources told Reuters, adding Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti had recommended the veto, arguing the takeover could have had consequences in the strategic semiconductor sector.
Among Applied Materials' products are machines used to manufacture semiconductors and other high-tech components.
The filing said the joint venture was also intended to take on Applied Materials' wafer equipment business in Singapore and its assets in China.
Italy reserves the right to use its anti-takeover legislation, or so-called ""golden powers"", to ward off undesired bids in industries deemed of strategic importance such as banking, energy, telecoms and health.
The government scrutinises a large number of merger and supply equipment deals, which in most cases are approved with recommendations intended to preserve the country's national interest.
Rome has so far stopped foreign interests in Italy five times since the introduction of the golden powers in 2012.
Four of these episodes beat away Chinese bids. Three have been under Draghi's nine-month old government, with the other adopted in 2020 under Draghi's predecessor Giuseppe Conte.
Draghi vetoed last month the sale of a vegetable seed producer to Chinese-owned group Syngenta, and prevented in April Chinese company Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co. Ltd. from buying a controlling stake in a firm producing semiconductor equipment.
Italy has also formally complained to Chinese investors over their undisclosed 2018 purchase of an Italian company making high-tech drones for the armed forces, in a first step towards possibly annulling the deal.  read more 
The so-called ""golden powers"" apply to non-EU groups and - under a temporary framework introduced in 2020 which is due to expire this year - to attempts by EU suitors to buy strategic companies.
One of the sources said Rome planned to extend the temporary regime by six months until June 30, 2022. This would include a measure forcing EU and non-EU suitors to seek government approval to buy a stake of at least 10% in strategic companies.",0
262,"NEW DELHI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - India's SpiceJet Ltd (SPJT.NS) has agreed to settle dues with lessors and creditors, and will conclude the hive-off of its cargo unit by January, the airline's chairman said, as it looks to clean-up its balance sheet as part of a recovery plan.
The budget carrier is reeling from losses due to the pandemic, which brought air travel to a near halt, as well as the worldwide grounding of Boeing's (BA.N) 737 MAX planes in 2019 following two fatal crashes.
Last week, SpiceJet and Boeing agreed to settle claims related to the MAX, which was cleared for flying in August by India's air safety watchdog. The Indian carrier was flying 13 MAX planes at the time of the grounding and has a total order of 155 aircraft.
""The compensation provided by Boeing is in cash and kind, and in the form of aircraft,"" Ajay Singh told reporters on Tuesday. He declined to give financial details of the deal.
The airline now plans to speed up the induction of the fuel-efficient MAX, adding 50 new planes over the next two years, which would ""make a big difference to SpiceJet's bottom line"", Singh said.
This has paved the way for SpiceJet to settle its liabilities, especially with several of its lessors, to which it was unable to make timely payments during the pandemic.
The airline will also conclude a hive-off of SpiceXpress by January so the cargo business can raise money separately for its logistics push, Singh said.
SpiceJet is also exploring the viability of scheduled long-haul flights using widebody planes which it started during the pandemic as charter operations to destinations in Canada and Europe.
""We are undertaking financial reengineering at SpiceJet. Our balance sheet will be better, we are settling our liabilities with lessors. In one way, we are cleaning up the company and launching SpiceJet 2.0 from January 2022,"" Singh said.",0
263,"JOHANNESBURG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - South Africa's largest opposition party won mayoral posts in three major cities in the country's economic heartland, a blow to the governing African National Congress (ANC) in the wake of its worst-ever election result.
Mayoral candidates from the ANC's main rival the Democratic Alliance (DA) won in the three metropolitan areas up for grabs in the country's most populated province of Gauteng: Johannesburg, Tshwane which includes the administrative capital Pretoria and Ekurhuleni, where the busiest airport is located.
However, DA victories were made possible by the support of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by firebrand Julius Malema, and ActionSA, led by a former DA mayor of Johannesburg who broke away from the party.
There seems little to unite them beyond their common enemy. The DA, for instance, has struggled to shake off its image as a party of white economic privilege, while the EFF argues for radical economic policies like the nationalisation of land and the central bank.
In municipal elections early this month the ANC's overall support dropped below 50% for the first time since the end of white minority rule, and its share of the vote in big cities like Pretoria and Johannesburg slid to roughly one-third.  read more 
The smaller opposition parties voted for the DA candidates despite negotiations between them failing to reach coalition agreements. That means the DA mayors will be beholden to the EFF and ActionSA to support their initiatives, and they could be voted out at short notice if relations turn fraught. A previous partnership between the DA and EFF broke down.
DA leader John Steenhuisen, who during the election was adamant he would do no deal with the EFF, told reporters his party's victories meant a psychological threshold had been crossed. ""Today the whole of South Africa knows that the ANC can be beaten,"" he said.
ANC spokesman Pule Mabe did not respond to a request for comment, but the ANC in Johannesburg has congratulated the DA's incoming mayor and said it would hold her administration accountable.
ActionSA said its support for the DA was motivated by a desire to keep the ANC out of power and it was now up to the DA to return to the negotiating table if it wanted stable local governments.",0

265,"UNITED NATIONS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The United Nations Libya mediator Jan Kubis is stepping down, a U.N. spokesman said on Tuesday, less than a year after he took up the role and a month before planned elections in the country.
The United Nations is informally suggesting veteran British diplomat Nicholas Kay as a replacement, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 15-member U.N. Security Council, operating by consensus, must approve a new appointment.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres accepted Kubis' resignation ""with regret,"" spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. When asked when Kubis would leave, Dujarric said: ""Mr Kubis has made it clear that he's not slamming the door today.""
""He, more than anyone, does not want to have the mission destabilized in any way, shape, or form,"" he said.
""The Secretary-General is working on an appropriate replacement. We are fully aware of the electoral calendar and are working as quickly as possible to ensure continuity of leadership,"" Dujarric said.
Kubis is a former Slovak foreign minister who has also served as the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon and the U.N. special envoy in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Security Council approved his appointment as Libya mediator in January, succeeding Ghassan Salame, who quit in March 2020 due to stress.
It was not immediately clear why Kubis was stepping down. Dujarric said the resignation ""did not come as a complete surprise"", but did not give further details.
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of longtime autocrat Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. In October last year, the two major sides in Libya's war - the internationally recognized Government of National Accord and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army - agreed a ceasefire.
Parliamentary and presidential elections on Dec. 24 were demanded by a U.N. political forum last year as part of a roadmap to end Libya's civil war. However, disputes over the planned vote threaten to derail the peace process.
A first-round presidential vote is set for Dec. 24 and the parliamentary election has been delayed to January or February. However, rules for the elections have not yet been agreed.",0

Companies are likely to drill 6,457 wells, an increase of 1,363 from 2021 and slightly above 2019's total, the association's Chief Executive Mark Scholz said in a statement. The CAOEC represents energy service companies.
The uptick follows a year in which Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) completed its Line 3 pipeline replacement project, allowing more oil to flow from Alberta to U.S. Midwest refineries, and as energy consumption recovered as COVID-19 restrictions eased, the CAOEC said.
Two more major pipelines, the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion and Coastal Gaslink, are under construction.
Labor shortages have hampered the service industry's efforts, however. CAOEC forecasts that the number of drilling rigs in Western Canada will decrease by eight to 481 rigs next year.

273,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said he did not believe that stablecoins were likely to evolve into a form of safe, regulated money, leaving central bank digital currencies as a more likely future for electronic payments.
""I think we have two choices broadly,"" Bailey told lawmakers in the upper house of Britain's parliament, as part of an inquiry into the future of digital payments.
""Is it going to evolve to some world of (asset-) backed stablecoins which has money-like features which could be regulated? I must say ... I am sceptical about that.
""Or ... is the better contribution, particularly to financial stability, to say the better alternative to that may be a central bank currency of digital form?""
Stablecoins are a form a virtual currency with values pegged to traditional assets such as the U.S. dollar or commodities, and their rise has accelerated discussion by central banks across the world about digital versions of their currencies.
Policymakers are concerned that a stablecoin or similar payment mechanism promoted by a tech giant - something Facebook (FB.O) has worked on for several years - could rapidly snowball and become dominant, raising competition, privacy and financial stability concerns.
The BoE and Britain's Treasury said this month they would hold formal consultations in 2022 on whether to move forward on a possible central bank digital currency (CBDC) which, if approved, would be introduced in the second half of the decade.
In his appearance before the House of Lords' Economic Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Bailey said he did not envisage the BoE offering digital bank accounts directly to savers.
""We do not see this as the Bank of England moving into the retail bank account business through a central bank digital  currency,"" he said.
Instead the BoE would provide the means of settlements to a regulated platform on which banks, and possibly alternative digital wallet holders, would operate.
The BoE would need powers over firms on the platform to protect privacy and the use of personal data, Bailey said.
Bailey also said work on a central bank digital currency was intended to solve problems linked to retail transactions and cash, and not as a tool to implement unconventional monetary policy such as a negative interest rate.",0

Local ethics committees have the power to authorise or block such requests.
Right-to-die has been for many years an highly contentious issue in Italy, where the Catholic Church, which exerts a strong influence over politics and public opinion, is fiercely opposed to more liberal legislation.
The panel in Marche said that Mario's condition met the requirements laid out by a 2019 constitutional court ruling, which include a chronic and irreversible pathology causing suffering the person considers intolerable.
""I feel lighter, I have relieved myself of all the tension I have accumulated over the years,"" Mario was quoted as saying by the Associazione Luca Coscioni right-to-die group after learning of the decision.
The committee, which granted the request following a failed petition to the regional health authority and a court appeal, said Mario was able to make his own decisions in a free and informed way.
""It is very regrettable that it has taken so long, but finally, for the first time in Italy, an ethics committee has confirmed the existence of the conditions for assisted suicide for a sick person,"" said Filomena Gallo, Mario's lawyer.",0
277,"COLOMBO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A Sri Lankan court on Tuesday began the trial of 25 men accused of plotting the Easter Sunday bombings that killed nearly 270 people in 2019, as lawyers warned of a protracted and complicated legal battle ahead.
The suspects were brought under heavy guard in batches from different prisons by police to the Colombo High Court during the morning hours.
Police have filed over 23,000 charges against the suspects, including conspiring to murder, aiding and abetting the attacks, and collecting arms and ammunition. Lawyers representing the suspects said the charges were too numerous in number and the case could take as long as a decade to conclude.
“As things are now it is impossible to identify which specific charges match with which suspect. We are hoping there will be more clarity on this. We are concerned that this case will drag on and it will be a futile exercise,” Attorney Noordeen M. Shaheed, who represents six of the suspects, told Reuters.
The group includes Mohammad Naufer, who officials say masterminded the attack and is linked to Islamic State. He was escorted by armed police to the court with his face covered by a piece of cloth.
Another key suspect is Y.M. Ibrahim, the father of two of the suicide bombers, Inshaf and Illham Ibrahim, who targeted two hotels in Colombo.
Lawyers for Naufer and Ibrahim could not be immediately reached for comment.
The string of attacks carried out on April 21 2019, Easter Sunday, targeted three churches and three hotels, killing 267 people, including at least 45 foreign nationals. At least 40 children also died.
The attacks, the worst in Sri Lanka’s turbulent history, also injured about 500 people, mostly belonging to the island’s minority Catholic community.
The Catholic community is keeping a close eye on the trial, said lawyer Neville Abeyratne who is representing the head of Sri Lanka’s Catholic Church Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith.
“We are monitoring this trial in the hope that when it ends we can bring civil action asking for compensation for those who were killed and injured,” he told Reuters.
Trials of two Sri Lankan officials accused of failing to prevent the attacks began on Monday.",0
278,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - British retailer Pets At Home (PETSP.L) said the number of households taking on new pets, which surged last year during COVID-19 lockdowns, is continuing to grow, driving up membership numbers and sparking a 77% jump in half-year earnings.
The UK's largest pet care retailer, which has 453 stores, said membership numbers of its puppy and kitten club more than doubled, with members typically spending a third more per annum than non-members. Active VIP members rose 13% to 6.8 million.
Shares in Pets At Home, which said that fiscal 2022 earnings will be at the top end of market estimates, climbed 7%, and were among top midcap gainers by 1450 GMT.
Lockdowns and work from home policies due to the spread of COVID-19 over the past two years have been accompanied by a surge in pet sales, making companies that operate in the animal care market among winners of the pandemic.
3.2 million UK households have brought a pet home since the start of the pandemic, as per the latest report from the Pet Food Manufacturers' Association (PFMA), a trade body representing the pet food industry.
""Conditions don't get much better for a pet superstore,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.
""It seems ongoing flexible working, and perhaps the renewed popularity of rural living, have culminated in the trend having more room to run than initially thought.""
The PFMA also estimates that around 17 million households were responsible for a pet's welfare, meaning roughly one in four British households owned a pet compared to one in five American households.
Pets At Home, which kept its stores, website and veterinary practices open for much of the pandemic, said new registrations at its high-margin veterinary practices business averaged at about 10,000 per week for the six months to Oct. 7.

Children are used as fighters as well as messengers, spies, cooks, cleaners, guards and porters by armed groups from Mali to Democratic Republic of Congo, UNICEF said in a report.
The United Nations verified about 21,000 children as being recruited by armed forces and non-state armed groups in the region between 2016 and 2020, the same number as in the whole preceding decade.
The number of U.N.-verified cases increased by 16% to 4,592 children in 2020 from 3,947 children in 2016, UNICEF said.
West and Central Africa also had the highest number of child victims of sexual violence in the world and the second highest number of abductions in the same period, UNICEF said.
""These are rankings we would rather not be part of. And, these are only the cases the U.N. was able to verify: the actual number of grave violations are much higher,"" said Karin Heissler, UNICEF Regional Chief of Child Protection, at a news briefing in Geneva.

Like many other countries in central and eastern Europe, the Czech Republic has seen a relatively slow vaccination campaign. It has fully vaccinated about 58% of its population, well below an average for the European Union of 69%, data shows, though more than 80% of Czech over-60s have received a shot.
Faced with a record surge in COVID-19 infections that is  straining hospitals, the government council for health risks backs the mandatory vaccination proposals, Babis said, adding that the health ministry would assess them next Tuesday.
""This age group (of over-60s) is the most at threat,"" Babis said.
From Monday only the vaccinated or those who have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months are allowed to enter Czech restaurants, hotels, cinemas, and gyms or to access other services.
Debate has turned to whether stricter lockdown measures may be needed to slow the spread, including making vaccines mandatory for specific professions, mirroring discussions in other countries including Germany.
Neighbouring Slovakia, with the third lowest vaccination rate in the 27-nation EU, has also targeted the unvaccinated with restrictions.
Austria, which borders both the Czech Republic and Slovakia, this week became the first nation in western Europe to re-impose a short-term lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19. It will require its whole population to get vaccinated as of February.
Hungary said last week it would make a third, booster shot mandatory for healthcare workers.",0

LIRA IN CRISIS AGAIN, BUT NOT A GLOBAL CONTAGION JUST YET (0917 EST/1417 GMT)
After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

283,"FRANKFURT, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Germany's next government is expected to pick a new head of the  Bundesbank, the national central bank, by the end of this week.
The three parties negotiating to form a government - the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Free Democrats - are due to wrap up talks in the coming days and decide on this position after cabinet jobs have been filled.
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann steps down on Dec. 31 after 10 years of largely fruitless opposition to the European Central Bank's easy-money policies.  read more 
Below is a list of potential candidates to take over at the German central bank when Weidmann leaves, five years before the official end of his second term:
ISABEL SCHNABEL
Schnabel is a member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, which would make a switch to the Bundesbank unprecedented.
In her first two years as an ECB board member, Schnabel has broken the mould of German opposition to bond purchases and negative interest rates and has defended the ECB from critics in her native country.
She has recently struck a hawkish note by saying inflation might turn out to be higher than the ECB currently expects.
JOACHIM NAGEL
Nagel is a Social Democrat who worked at the Bundesbank for 17 years, rising through the ranks to become a board member before stepping down in 2016.
At the German central bank he was responsible for markets and information technology and would not routinely comment on monetary policy.
He is currently the deputy head of the banking department of the Bank for International Settlements, which he joined in 2020 after a four-year spell at German state bank KfW.
He holds a degree in economics.
JAKOB VON WEIZSÄCKER
Weizsäcker has been the chief economist of the German Ministry of Finance under Olaf Scholz, who is now the leading candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor.
He was a member of the European Parliament for Scholz's Social Democrats between 2014 and 2019, sitting on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
A prominent member of an aristocratic family, he is a pro-European economist who is well regarded by the German centre-right.
JOERG KUKIES
As Germany's deputy finance minister, Kukies is incoming chancellor Olaf Scholz's right-hand man.
He has a PhD in finance from the University of Chicago and worked for Goldman Sachs for 17 years before joining the government in 2018.
He was criticised for his role in the Wirecard scandal for sending Scholz a nine-page memo in which he played down concerns about the payment company and outlined a plan to rescue it with funds from state bank KfW.
VOLKER WIELAND
Wieland is a long-serving member of the German Council of Economic Experts, which advises the German government.
He has often warned that an overly loose monetary policy could create financial bubbles, but defended the ECB's bond-buying programme when Germany's constitutional court heard a 2019 challenge to its stimulus programmes.
Wieland recently told Handelsblatt the ECB needed a plan to exit from its low-rate policy as the current inflation surge was ""more than just a short-term rash"".
Wieland teaches monetary economics at the University of Frankfurt.
MARCEL FRATZSCHER
Fratzscher is the most ""dovish"" candidate on the list, having backed the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy and called for more fiscal spending in Germany.
He has told Handelsblatt the current inflation rate is ""nothing to worry about"" and that the ECB should not raise rates in response.
A former European Central Bank economist, he teaches macroeconomics and finance at Berlin's Humboldt University and runs the DIW Berlin think-tank.
CLAUDIA BUCH
Buch has been the Bundesbank's vice-president since 2014 after a two-year stint on the German Council of Economic Experts.
The 55-year old former university professor accompanies Weidmann to meetings of the ECB's Governing Council.
But she has largely steered clear of the monetary policy debate in public, focusing instead on issues relating to financial stability.
JENS ULBRICH
The Bundesbank's chief economist has worked for the German central bank since 2005 after a five-year stint as the general secretary of the German Council of Economic Experts.
The 52-year-old economist is active on Twitter but has not expressed views about monetary policy in public, mainly explaining the ECB's decisions and commenting on the economic outlook.
LARS FELD
Feld's main field of research is economic and fiscal policy.
Seen as a representative of Germany's economic orthodoxy, he has in the past called for higher interest rates to prevent a property bubble.
But he has also defended the ECB's asset purchases before Germany's constitutional court and backed the euro zone central bank's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
A former chair of the German Council of Economic Experts, Feld teaches economic policy and constitutional economics at the University of Freiburg. He has been chosen as the head of Vienna's Institute for Advanced Studies.",0

Currency markets have been mostly driven in recent months by market perceptions of the different paces at which global central banks reduce pandemic-era stimulus and raise rates.
Powell’s renomination supports the view that the Fed is likely to begin raising rates in mid-2022, after ends its bond purchase program.

Jahid Ahmed, who bowled for Essex from 2005-2009, told The Cricketer he was bullied by a senior coach and that his accent was mocked by players and some members of the coaching staff.
Jahid's revelations follow similar claims by Chambers and Sharif. Chambers, who played for Essex between 2005 and 2013, said he was so upset by the racist bullying he faced at the county that he would go home and cry after matches.  read more

288,"MOSCOW, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Russia will resume beef and pork imports from 12 subsidiaries of Brazilian producers from Nov. 25, its agriculture safety watchdog said in a statement on Tuesday.
Most of the Russian restrictions on Brazilian beef and pork producers have been in place since 2017 due to alleged use of the feed additive ractopamine. Brazilian meat industry groups have denied using the additive.
Moscow allowed beef imports from another three units of major Brazilian beef exporters last week as it moved to boost domestic supply.  read more 
Further supplies will resume from nine units producing pork and three units producing beef from Thursday, the watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor, added. It did not name the producers.
""Rosselkhoznadzor continues to work on expanding the list of Brazilian producers certified to supply beef to Russia,"" it said.
Brazil's biggest beef processors – JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), Minerva SA (BEEF3.SA) and Marfrig Global Foods SA (MRFG3.SA) – did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Russia plans to set a duty-free import quota for up to 200,000 tonnes of beef in 2022 to boost domestic supply as part of measures the government hopes will help stabilise domestic inflation, which is at a five-year high.
For Brazil - the world's largest beef exporter - Russia is a promising market as its exports to China were temporarily suspended in September after two atypical cases of mad cow disease were reported in the South American nation.
At the time, Brazil's Agriculture Ministry stressed that the two cases had generated spontaneously and were not related to contaminated feed, as in classic mad cow disease.
Since the cases in cattle were announced, Brazil has also reported two cases of the neurodegenerative Creutzfeldt-Jakob disorder in people, though agriculture officials said they were not related to beef consumption.  read more ",0

291,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Providers of environmental, social and governance ratings are on notice. The International Organization of Securities Commissions on Tuesday said oversight of what has long been a notoriously opaque sector needs to improve. It’s not an immediate problem for big players like S&P Global (SPGI.N), MSCI (MSCI.N) and Moody’s (MCO.N), but still highlights a more serious medium-term threat.
IOSCO’s 56-page report ostensibly contains little to fret about. The global standards-setter wants the ESG ratings bestowed on companies to be more transparent in their data and the methodology used to spit out a grade. That may help explain how a company like Tesla (TSLA.O), for example, could be given wildly different ratings by three different providers. Still, IOSCO only sets broad recommendations: domestic regulators decide the detail.
What’s less in doubt is that the market is booming. IOSCO cites research stating that annual spending on ESG data is growing at a 20% clip and could hit $1 billion this year, as asset managers try to ensure they are investing sustainably. It is also becoming more concentrated: since 2019, S&P Global has acquired the ratings business of Switzerland’s RobecoSAM, Moody’s has bought France’s Vigeo Eiris, MSCI has snapped up Carbon Delta and Morningstar (MORN.O) now owns all of the Netherlands’ Sustainalytics.
Yet membership of this exclusive club may not stay valuable. Right now, ESG-keen investors find it difficult to access decent data on greenhouse gas emissions and other ESG metrics because companies themselves may not know or disclose it. Subscribing to ratings or data sets from the big players makes life easier.
That could change. IOSCO’s calls for more transparency are part of a broader shift. The UK government  said before COP26 that UK companies would in 2022 have to reveal climate data  read more . The Glasgow conference also saw the launch of the new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which will issue guidelines for carbon disclosures. And so-called open-source platforms like OS-Climate will help clean data and make it more freely available to asset managers.
In an ideal world, meaningful climate data would be public and there would be little need for rating firms to interpret it. That won’t happen overnight. And even if it materialises, ESG bigwigs can still make money by advising companies on how to ensure their disclosures satisfy both the ISSB and the European Union, which has its own reporting standard for funds. But that may mean a smaller, less lucrative market.

CONTEXT NEWS
- The International Organization of Securities Commissions on Nov. 23 announced a series of recommendations to improve the regulation of providers of environmental, social and governance ratings.
- IOSCO, which groups securities watchdogs from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, published 10 recommendations for its members to apply in day-to-day work.
- Asset managers use ratings from about 160 raters, such as MSCI, S&P Global and Morningstar, to pick stocks and bonds for “green” products now popular with ethical investors, but there are no regulatory checks on how those ratings were put together.
- IOSCO said its recommendations will begin shining a light on how ratings are compiled and conflicts of interest handled in a largely unregulated business which is already worth around $1 billion and growing at 20% a year.
- Earlier this month a new global body was set up to introduce rigour into how companies make ESG-related disclosures. Until now, asset managers have relied heavily on ratings in the absence of high-quality company disclosures.",0
292,"STRASBOURG, France, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The thousands of migrants on the European Union's eastern borders with Belarus is an attempt by the Minsk regime to destabilise the EU, rather than a migration crisis, the head of the executive European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said.
Speaking at the European Parliament, von der Leyen said the 27-nation bloc was standing in solidarity with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia which bear the brunt of the policy of Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko to fly migrants from various world hotspots into Belarus and then push them across EU borders.
""It is the EU as a whole that is being challenged,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is not a migration crisis. This is the attempt of an authoritarian regime to try to destabilise its democratic neighbours.""
She said the EU was coordinating with the United States, Britain and Canada.
""We agreed that to counter this behaviour, it is important to coordinate our sanctions and to work with countries of origin and the airlines that are transporting migrants to Minsk. And this is what we have done, and what we are doing. We are in the process of coordinating our sanctions with the United States, Canada and the UK,"" she said.
She said that to deter intermediaries transporting migrants to Belarus from helping Minsk, the EU would create a watchlist for all means of transport involved in trafficking and smuggling of migrants.
""Today the Commission is putting forward a legislative proposal to do this,"" she said.",0
293,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in choppy trading in a holiday-shortened week on Tuesday as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve to become more aggressive in fighting inflation after President Joe Biden nominated Chair Jerome Powell for a second term.  read more 
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes  was up 5.7 basis points to 1.682%, its highest level in a week and less than 10 basis points below the high for the year, hit in March. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond  was up 6.2 basis points to 2.040%.
The move higher in yields was not uniform, however. The two-year  U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 1.4 basis points at 0.616% after touching its highest level since March 2020 on Monday.
""The pressure on the Fed to react to the recent acceleration in inflation is building, not just from the so-called inflation vigilantes and the hawks on the Committee, but also from the progressive academics and from their peers at other central banks,"" said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities.
Not all investors expect the Fed to act against inflation in the next few months. The Treasury Department auctioned $59 billion in 7-year notes on Tuesday, with direct bidders taking their highest percentage of the inventory since December 2019.
That level of investor interest could mean that the recent rise in yields may be short-lived, said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies.
""The strong auction bid suggests that the market might finally be finding some footing,"" he said. ""Does it make sense to price in more rate hikes over the next couple of years? We do not think so, and it looks like Direct bidders agree. We expect that the market will start to clean up the mess here, and it will trade well after Thanksgiving and into month-end.""
The yield curve slightly steepened, with spreads between 5- and 30-year Treasuries rising on Tuesday after touching their lowest levels since March 2020 the previous day.
The yield on 5-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities slipped to end at -1.695% and the yield on the 10-year TIP closed at -0.96, its highest end of day yield since Nov 3.

294,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. business activity slowed moderately in November amid labor shortages and raw material delays, contributing to prices continuing to soar halfway through the fourth quarter.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a reading of 56.5 in mid-November from 57.6 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
The rate of growth remains above the survey's long-run pre-pandemic average, and is consistent with an economy that is regaining steam after a brief lull in the summer.
The services sector accounted for the pull back in activity, with IHS Market noting ""some resistance to higher prices.""
Though many firms reported business was strong because of increased travel both domestic and international as well as the further easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the pace of growth slowed relative to previous months.
""The U.S. economy continues to run hot,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""However, the slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints.""
The survey's measure of prices paid by businesses for inputs jumped to 78.1. That was the highest reading since the series started in 2009 and followed 74.1 in October. These higher prices are being passed on to consumers, indicating that inflation could remain uncomfortably high for a while.
Consumer prices surged in October, logging their biggest annual increase in 31 years.  read more 
A measure of employment at businesses was little changed in the first half of this month. There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September.
Millions of Americans remain home even as generous federal government-funded unemployment benefits ended in early September, more people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and companies are raising wages. The pandemic has also led to early retirements and career changes.
The survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a reading of 57.0 early in the month from 58.7 in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 59 in mid-November for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Unfinished work at the services industry businesses piled up at the second-fastest pace on record, IHS Markit said.
Despite the supply constraints, manufacturing activity picked up, amid an influx of new orders. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI increased 59.1 from a reading of 58.4 in October. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy, climbing to 59.
According to IHS Markit, difficulties securing inputs and finding affordable transportation for goods led to cost burdens rising at a record pace in mid-November. It noted that firms increased their selling prices at the second-steepest pace in more than 14-1/2 years.",0
295,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Transcription and captioning services provider Verbit on Tuesday notched a valuation of about $2 billion by selling $150 million worth of new shares in a funding round led by Third Point Ventures.
The startup, which uses artificial intelligence to offer services such as live captioning and the real-time transcription of webinars and meetings, also allowed some employees and existing investors to sell $100 million of their own shares.
Other investors in the Series E round included Sapphire Ventures, More Capital, Disruptive AI, Vertex Growth, 40North, Samsung Next and TCP.
The financing is likely to be Verbit's final fundraise before a potential initial public offering (IPO).
In an interview with Reuters, Verbit founder Tom Livne said the company plans to go public within the next 18 months, and that hedge fund Third Point has the same expectations.
""We have already started internal preparations,"" said Livne, adding that Verbit will most likely take the traditional IPO route to go public.
The company has now raised $550 million from private investors since it was founded in 2017. Its valuation has nearly doubled since its June funding round.
Verbit said it intends to use the fresh capital to fund acquisitions and launch more products.
Its customers include companies such as online education provider Coursera (COUR.N) and video-streaming software company Kaltura (KLTR.O).
Verbit has benefited from strong demand for transcription and captioning services during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced businesses to operate remotely and host meetings online.
The company is set to generate more than $100 million in revenue this year, up five times from last year, Livne said.",0
296,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Lithium consumers in the electric vehicle battery supply chain are seeking longer-term contracts with producers to secure supplies for as long as possible in a market where shortages have propelled prices to their highest in three years.
Prices for lithium carbonate in China, a key material used to make rechargeable batteries, at 197,500 yuan ($30,940) a tonne are up 276% since the start of this year  due to booming demand alongside accelerating sales of electric vehicles.
Australia's Pilbara Minerals (PLS.AX) recently auctioned its lithium sourced from hard rock, or spodumene, for $2,350 a tonne, an 88% rise from the $1,250 fetched in a July auction.
Higher prices have persuaded lithium consumers, mostly in China which dominates the electric vehicle supply chain, they need to tie up supply in contracts, which in some instances are as long as three years.  read more 
Fixed prices for the length of the contract are now rare compared with previous years.
Negotiations typically start in September and October and conclude in November and December.
Producers are seeking monthly or quarterly ""price breaks,"" where the price of the contract is negotiated more frequently due to volatility.
""Prices are up over 230% year to date, really around a lack of available material,"" said Caspar Rawles, analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
""As a result, people are willing to sign up for longer-term contracts going into 2022 with more frequent price breaks.""
Spodumene contracts for 2022 are kicking off at around $1,500 a tonne for the start of 2022, lithium market sources say, compared with $400 a tonne to $1500 a tonne so far this year.
More than half of the world's lithium is used to make  rechargeable batteries, also used in mobile phones and laptops, while the rest of it is used in industries that make glasses, ceramics and pharmaceuticals.
Higher prices have encouraged some miners to restart production or accelerate new projects, raising the prospect of prices falling victim to rising lithium supplies.  read more 
But a lengthy chemical qualification process, delays to mining projects and a lack of investment in new projects over the last few years means significant oversupply is unlikely, analysts say.
The world's five largest producers including Albemarle (ALB.N) and SQM (SQMA.SN) together account for about 50% of global lithium sales.

297,"QUITO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso has pardoned prisoners jailed for minor traffic crimes and others suffering terminal illnesses to alleviate overcrowding in penitentiaries across the country, his press office said.
A wave of violence has beset Ecuador's prisons in recent months, leaving scores of prisoners dead as gangs fight for control of drug trafficking routes.
As well as violence, Ecuador's prisons are plagued by overcrowding of around 30% and poor living conditions for the system's 39,000 inmates.
In a statement announcing the move late on Monday, the government did not specify how many prisoners will receive a pardon.
""This decision includes the total forgiveness of custodial sentences but does not extinguish the obligation of comprehensive reparations (to victims) that all those receiving  pardons are responsible for,"" the statement added.
Ecuador is also preparing to send 170 Colombian prisoners back to their own country, following an agreement with Colombia's government over the weekend.  read more ",0
298,"MUMBAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - India is looking to bar most private cryptocurrencies when it introduces a new bill to regulate virtual currencies in the winter session of Parliament, the government said late on Tuesday.
The government will allow only certain cryptocurrencies to promote the underlying technology and its uses, according to a legislative agenda for the winter session that is set to start later this month.
Through the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, India is also looking to make a framework for the official digital currency that will be issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
The central bank has voiced ""serious concerns"" about private cryptocurrencies and is set to launch its own digital currency by December.
Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, is hovering around $60,000, and its price has more than doubled since the start of this year, attracting hordes of local investors.
No official data is available but industry estimates suggest there are 15 million to 20 million crypto investors in India, with total crypto holdings of around 400 billion rupees ($5.39 billion).
Earlier this year, India's government considered criminalising the possession, issuance, mining, trading and transference of crypto assets, but a bill was not introduced.  read more 
Since then, the government has changed its stance slightly and is now looking to discourage trading in cryptocurrencies by imposing hefty capital gains and other taxes, two sources told Reuters this month.
But a senior government official told Reuters that the plan is to ban private crypto assets ultimately while paving the way for a new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies amid concerns that unregulated crypto markets could become avenues for money laundering and terror financing, sources told Reuters separately.  read more ",0
299,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bricks-and-mortar retailers are fighting back hard against their online rivals. That was the message from Britain’s AO World (AO.L), which on Tuesday issued its second profit warning in two months. The electricals retailer, most of whose sales are online, said supply-chain issues, product shortages and rising costs meant the all-important pre-Christmas trading period was weaker than anticipated only eight weeks ago. It’s little wonder its shares fell 19%.
The 500 million pound firm admitted that traditional retailers in Germany were “waking up” to online selling, driving up the cost of AO’s digital marketing. Online-only fashion retailers like Boohoo (BOOH.L) and ASOS (ASOS.L) provide further evidence of a counter-revolution – their shares have halved this year. Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC), which has nearly 7,000 actual shops, is up 20%. Rival H&M (HMb.ST), whose stores pulled in 72% of its revenue last year, is flat. Even in the event of more lockdowns, AO and its ilk will have stiffer online competition. (By Aimee Donnellan)

300,"ABUJA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Flour Mills of Nigeria said on Tuesday it will acquire a majority stake in rival Honeywell Flour Mills with its own cash and some debt and aims to apply for regulatory approval in the next day or so.
The pasta maker said it was also looking at opportunities in West African countries, Chief Executive Boye Olusanya told an analyst call, adding that the deal was necessary to defend its market share.
On Monday, Flour Mills said it will acquire a total of 77% of Honeywell Flour Mills, sending its smaller rival's shares higher.  read more 
""We see a clear correlation with reaching more consumers. We see the cost aspects, back office and some of manufacturing processes. Lastly ... we see stronger balance sheet,"" Chief Financial Officer Anders Kristiansson said.
Kristiansson said Flour Mills has a cash balance of 51 billion naira ($125 million) as of September and that the acquisition was part of plans to grow the business.
Flour Mills, which generates 80% of its sales from food and agro-business, plans to expand its reach in Nigeria and also cash in on demand of wheat-based products in the region.
In 2019, Singapore-based commodity trader Olam International agreed to buy Nigeria's Dangote Flour Mills for an enterprise value of 130 billion naira.
The acquisition helps Flour Mills to build scale and increase it range of products and help the pasta maker defend its market share especially as Nigeria joins the continental free trade zone with anticipated increase in competition.
Both companies will operate as separate legal entities but will achieve operational synergies after the acquisition.

301,"CHICAGO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Facing scarce year-end inventories and a shortage of workers, retailers are turning ""Black Friday"" into a month-long event.
Walmart, the world's largest retailer, said on Monday it had already started ""Black Friday"" discounts, such as $30 off AirPods and KidKraft dollhouses. Walmart, whose stores will be closed on Thanksgiving for the second year in a row, said it would only offer the same discounts in stores on Friday.
Rival big-box retailer Target on Sunday began running its own Black Friday sales, such as up to 30% off Samsung and TCL flat screen televisions, and 50% off headphones. Target said on Monday that from now on, it will keep all its roughly 1,900 stores closed on Thanksgiving.
The Thanksgiving weekend previously kicked off the U.S. holiday shopping season with ""doorbuster"" discounts that had consumers lining up for blocks outside brick-and-mortar stores across the country on Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving. In recent years, shopping at stores on Black Friday has faded, with online sales on the day outpacing brick-and-mortar sales for the first time in 2019.
This year, retailers started promoting online holiday ""deals"" as early as September, because the ongoing supply chain logjam threatened to block them from bringing new merchandise from Asia into the United States in the weeks before the Christmas holiday. But the bargains are modest. Retailers are expected to dangle price cuts of 5%-to-25% this Friday, only slightly deeper than the 5%-to-10%-off discounts they offered in October, according to Adobe Digital Economy Index.
Best Buy said on Tuesday during an earnings conference that starting its Black Friday promotions in mid-October hurt quarterly profit margins.
Retailers have increasingly reduced Black Friday store hours as shoppers turn to online shopping. ""Are discounts going to be as prevalent and as deep as they normally have been in the last few years?” asked Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group. “No, not if the demand for product is high and the supply is low – there’s no reason to promote discounts.”
""Stores are trying to berate the public into thinking ‘get it now or it might be gone,"" said 70-year-old artist Maggie Smith from Tucson, Arizona.
According to a Reuters/IPSOS poll of about 1,000 people, more than a fifth of shoppers said they planned to primarily buy gifts online this year, while only 12% said they would shop primarily in stores. Online sales on Black Friday itself are expected to increase by 5% to $9.5 billion, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index.
Walmart and Target both said they would invest more in same-day options, including the ability for shoppers to pick up merchandise ordered online.
But fulfilling quick-turn online orders could put pressure on retailers' labor forces at a time when warehouse workers are in short supply.
""We're seeing double-time for those shifts and increases in the pay, but then that's going to be painful,"" said Andy Halliwell, senior director of retail at consultancy Publicis Sapient. ""That's going to come out of the retailers' margins.""
JC Penney, which is owned by Simon Property Group (SPG.N) and Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), wants to hire 3,000 supply-chain workers in distribution centers in addition to 25,000 seasonal associates. The retailer is offering $2,000 retention bonuses for select supply chain associates in certain locations.
Macy’s (M.N), which plans to hire 71,000 seasonal workers, said that nearly one-third of those employees will work in fulfillment centers across the country, and Kohl’s (KSS.N) in July said it would give maximum bonuses of $400 to hourly store and supply chain associates who stuck around for the holiday season.
To be sure, some retailers said they are preparing for brick-and-mortar stores to make a comeback, and said they have enough inventory.
""We’re seeing our customers return to in-store shopping,"" William White, Walmart's chief marketing officer in the United States, told Reuters. White also said Walmart has expanded its toy assortment by ""more than double.""
For Marc Ivan, a 23-year-old student in Philadelphia, going to stores isn't a tradition he plans to give up, even though he said he will do most of his shopping online as early as possible this week.

304,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A global licence for serological technology that detects COVID-19 antibodies will be provided royalty-free to poor and middle-income countries under a first of its kind agreement to boost production, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday.
The existing four tests, which check for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies developed after either an infection or a vaccine dose, could also inform decisions on the need for boosters to protect against the disease, it said in a statement.
The non-exclusive licensing agreement reached with the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), a public research institute offering the technology as a global public good, is the first test licence signed by the WHO's Medicines Patent Pool (MPP).
""The aim of the licence is to facilitate the rapid manufacture and commercialisation of CSIC's COVID-19 serological test worldwide,"" the WHO said.
""The licence will be royalty-free for low- and middle-income countries and will remain valid until the date the last patent expires,"" it said.
The tests are simple to use and suitable for even rural  settings with a basic laboratory infrastructure, it added.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the deal which he hoped would inspire other developers to share tools against COVID-19 which has killed 5.4 million people since the virus emerged in central China in December 2019.
""This is the kind of open and transparent licence we need to move the needle on access during and after the pandemic,"" Tedros said.
""I urge developers of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics to follow this example and turn the tide on the pandemic and on the devastating global inequity this pandemic has spotlighted.""
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) welcomed the deal, noting that currently WHO only had one antibody test using quantitative immunoassays (ELISA) made by Roche Holding AG which can only be used with the Swiss-based drugmaker’s own device.
""In order to overcome the monopoly of large diagnostics companies such as Roche, and to facilitate production and supply of reliable ELISA antibody tests in all countries, the open licence from CSIC to WHO C-TAP (COVID-19 Technology Access Pool) is an important step forward,"" the activist group said.
""However, one licence from one technology owner is not enough to open up the full platform so that developers in countries can improve their tests for COVID-19 antibodies. Removing intellectual property barriers on all key technology components, and facilitating open sharing, pooling and transferring of technologies, data and know-how, are important to guarantee and improve access to COVID-19 diagnostics for all.""",0
305,"NEW DELHI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - India and the United States agreed on Tuesday to expand trade of some agricultural products, including U.S. cherries, alfalfa and distiller dried grains as well as Indian mangoes, grapes, shrimp and water buffalo meat.
In a joint statement issued after the first U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum meeting in four years in New Delhi, the two countries' trade ministers also discussed the possibility of restoring India's trade benefits under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences.
The statement came as U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai ended a two-day visit to try to rebuild trade ties between the world's richest and largest democracies.
""The Ministers expressed an intent to continue to work together on resolving outstanding trade issues as some of these require additional engagement  in order to reach convergence in the near future,"" the statement from Tai and Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said.
New Delhi and Washington have sparred over a range of issues including tariffs for over a year, hampering the prospects of concluding a bilateral trade package.
Tuesday's meeting followed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington in September when both leaders agreed to expand trade ties to strengthen relations.
""The forum heralds a new beginning in India-U.S. trade partnership,"" Goyal said in a tweet after the meeting.
The two ministers agreed to use the ""revitalized"" forum to rapidly engage on new trade concerns as they arise and plan to evaluate progress on a quarterly basis.
The two sides also discussed U.S. interest in supplying ethanol to India and speeding up phyto-sanitary work to allow more agricultural imports for both countries, including U.S. pork and Indian table grapes.
India also raised its interest in restoration of its beneficiary status under GSP, the U.S. program that provides some tariff-free access for imports from developing countries that expired at the end of 2020. The Trump administration in 2019 had terminated India's access for about $5.6 billion of annual exports amid disputes over digital trade and other issues.
The United States noted in the statement that ""this could be considered, as warranted, in relation to the eligibility criteria determined by the U.S. Congress.""
For India and other developing countries to receive GSP trade benefits, Congress would have to reauthorize the program, which may come with new restrictions and conditions on labor and environmental issues.
Tai, accompanied in New Delhi by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi, earlier raised issues of market access restrictions, high tariffs, unpredictable regulations and restricted digital trade between the two countries. read more 
India has been resisting a U.S. demand to lower tariffs, arguing that applied tariffs were way below the permissible limit under the WTO rules, while seeking more exports of goods and services.
Bilateral goods' trade between the two countries in the first nine months this year rose nearly 50% from a year earlier as their economies reopened after restrictions due to the pandemic, and is set to surpass $100 billion this year, the joint statement said.",0

Tighter restrictions in many countries and a reimposed lockdown in Austria - the first in western Europe since vaccines were rolled out - has raised the spectre of a second straight winter of tough curbs throughout the continent.  read more 
""Up until last weekend, things were going great. Volumes were back running at about 100% of our pre-COVID price volumes. It has been disrupted by the Austrian lockdown and there is a renewed concern across Europe about a fourth or firth wave of COVID,"" O'Leary told an online event

Vivendi has criticised KKR's 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) non-binding, cash proposal for Telecom Italia (TIM), saying it does not adequately value Italy's former phone monopoly.
Shares in TIM, which gained 30% on Monday, closed down 4.7%after Vivendi's comments, underperforming Milan's 1.7% fall (.FTITLMS).
""Vivendi wishes to clarify that the group is very attached to Italy and to Telecom Italia (and) has no intention to sell its stake,"" a Vivendi spokesperson said.
KKR, whose approach gives TIM an enterprise value of 33 billion euros when including net debt, could offer 0.505 euros a share for what would be Europe's biggest private equity buyout.
While that represents a 45.7% premium to the closing price of ordinary shares prior to the announcement, it is below the 0.83 euros a share at which Vivendi books its 24% TIM stake.
""The premium is above most of the recent delistings registered in the EU telecom sector and although the valuation may appear undemanding this could be explained by TIM's difficult fundamental outlook,"" UBS said.
KKR aims to take TIM private, which analysts say would make a restructuring easier.
A minimum acceptance threshold of 51% for the offer means Vivendi's backing is not strictly needed.
However, pushing through extraordinary resolutions requires a two-thirds majority and KKR would struggle to turn TIM around without its top investor onboard.
Vivendi has seen TIM shares lose 70% since it became a shareholder in mid-2015, against a 40% sector drop (.SXKP).
PRESSURE ON CEO
Two profit warnings from TIM since July, amid ferocious domestic competition and a costly soccer rights deal with Dazn, have strengthened Vivendi's hand in demanding a change at the helm.
Having failed to stem TIM's revenue decline, CEO Luigi Gubitosi had presented the board with a project to squeeze cash from TIM's assets, including its prized fixed lines, but failed to win Vivendi's backing, sources have said.
After the board met earlier this month at Vivendi's behest to discuss TIM's woes, a new meeting on the company's performance has been called for Friday.
Following KKR's approach, the board is also expected to decide whether to grant access to data for the four-week due diligence analysis KKR has requested before a proper offer.
Two people close to the matter said Friday's board meeting could be pushed back, which would give directors more time to study the file. One of the sources said it could be delayed by a week.
Meanwhile, TIM's nomination committee meets on Wednesday and the risk control board on Thursday to discuss the situation after the biggest shareholder challenged the CEO.
Vivendi wants to get directly involved in discussions over TIM's fixed assets, sources have said, as stalled plans to spin them off and merge them with those of rival Open Fiber get fresh impetus.
Such assets are deemed strategic by the government which has created a special committee to follow developments with KKR's approach. After a first meeting on Monday night, Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, one of its members, on Tuesday said the government would assess any project concerning a strategic asset such as TIM's network when it has the details.
TIM's fixed line business provides Italy's main telecoms infrastructure and plays a major role in broadband rollout efforts on which Rome plans to spend billions of euros of European Union funds to improve coverage.
State investor CDP has taken a 10% stake in TIM to oversee the network and is expected to play a key role in any plans to carve out the grid.",0
308,"SANTIAGO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Chile is set for a divisive presidential run-off next month between a 35-year-old leftist former protest leader and an ultraconservative who has promised to crack down on crime.
But perhaps the most important question, pollsters say, is what will happen to the 900,000 votes that went to a 54-year-old NASCAR enthusiast who lives in Alabama.
In a Sunday first-round vote, hard-right former congressman Jose Antonio Kast finished on top with 27.9% of ballots cast, while left-wing lawmaker Gabriel Boric came in second with 25.8%. As both candidates fell far short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright, they are now scrambling to forge alliances and win over voters who chose unsuccessful contenders.
Front and center is perennial candidate Franco Parisi, a celebrity economist who surprised many by finishing third with 12.8% of the vote, despite never setting foot in Chile during the campaign. In some northern cities, including the mining hubs of Antofagasta and Calama, he won by significant margins.
Observers say his supporters are more anti-establishment than left-leaning or conservative, which makes it hard to predict where their votes will go in the run-off. But with Boric and Kast locked in an extremely competitive race, it will be key to the election's outcome.
Parisi does not plan to endorse a candidate in the run-off, spokesman Juan Marcelo Valenzuela told Chile's Radio Bio-Bio on Monday, but eyes will nonetheless be on any statements made by the notoriously opinionated and unpredictable economist in the coming weeks. Parisi plans to hold a digital poll among supporters in December to see who they prefer, Valenzuela said.
In an early November poll by Activa Research, Parisi voters favored Boric in a theoretical second round, though the difference was well within the margin of error.
Some analysts, extrapolating from trends in previous elections, told Reuters they expect Kast will perform slightly better than those surveys suggest.
""I want to vote for Boric, but you have to be conscientious and think of the future,"" said Luis Bugueno, a 22-year-old financial consultant in the northern city of Coquimbo who voted for Parisi in the first round. Bugueno, who has not decided who he will vote for in the run-off, is concerned about some of Boric's more radical policy ideas.
""I don't want to wake up and overnight, we've turned into one of our neighboring countries where people are trying to emigrate,"" he said.
According to local media reports, Parisi lives in a suburb of Birmingham and previously taught at the University of Alabama. He told local newspaper Diario Financiero in September that he likes the American South because it's safe, cheap and has good public schools.
His policies tend to the right on economic issues and to the left on social issues, but are often idiosyncratic and difficult to pin down.
Parisi is not the only candidate whose voters are in play in the second round. Center-right Sebastian Sichel and center-left Yasna Provoste both received well over 10% of the vote on Sunday, meaning their voters could be crucial.
Kenneth Bunker, head of political consultancy Tresquintos, estimated that the second round votes would go to Kast 60-40, while Gonzalo Cordero, a political consultant and columnist, estimated they would go to Kast two-to-one.
While neither Sichel nor Provoste has endorsed a candidate in the second round, Sichel has said he will not vote for Boric and Provoste has said she would not vote for Kast.
Parisi supporters, meanwhile, remain a mystery.",0
309,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira sank up to 15% on Tuesday to an unprecedented 13.45 per dollar after President Tayyip Erdogan defended interest rate cuts despite surging inflation.
Erdogan's insistence on lower rates forced the central bank to cut again this month, making it 400 basis points of cuts this year to 15%, with signs of more to come. Inflation in Turkey runs at 20% and is seen rising further.  read more 
Erdogan said on Monday higher rates would not lower inflation, and vowed to win his ""economic war of independence"". Market experts and former central bank members have called for immediate tightening to stem the lira's plunge.  read more 
The lira, which was at 9.6 a dollar at the beginning of the month, has fallen 11% this week alone, taking yearly losses to 42%, a far cry from a 0.2% rise in MSCI's index of EM currencies (.MIEM00000CUS) this year. The lira was last trading down 12.5%.
""We do, however, expect local actions to be taken in an attempt to stabilize the currency, although further lira depreciation and new record lows against the dollar are very likely,"" analysts at Wells Fargo wrote in a client note.
Contagion fears from Turkey were limited given investors have reduced exposure after years of erratic policy.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey's banks,"" said Simon MacAdam, senior global economist at Capital Economics.
Turkey banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 18% this month. The broader stocks index (.XU100) is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.

310,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Biden administration asked a federal appeals court on Tuesday to lift a court-ordered stay on a sweeping workplace COVID-19 vaccine rule to avoid serious harm to public health, or alternatively to allow a masking-and-testing requirement.
Delaying the rule by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) that requires employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly would lead to thousands of hospitalizations and deaths, the administration said in a filing with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The White House asked for the rule to be reinstated immediately, but the court set a briefing schedule that runs through Dec. 10.
The administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has issued several rules aimed at encouraging vaccinations, although OSHA's Nov. 5 standard is the most far-reaching.
The OSHA rule requires businesses with at least 100 employees, covering tens of millions of American workers, to comply by Jan. 4.
Although 82% of U.S. adults have gotten at least one vaccine dose, requiring shots against COVID-19 has become a divisive political issue over trade-offs between civil liberty and public health.
The rule was challenged by Republican-led states, businesses and trade groups, and it was quickly blocked by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, which called it ""staggeringly overbroad"" and a ""one-size-fits-all sledgehammer.""  read more 
After the stay was imposed, lawsuits from across the country were transferred to the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati.  read more 
That has given the Biden administration an opportunity to ask for the 5th Circuit ruling to be reviewed.
The administration said in its filing that if the ruling remained, it should at least be modified to allow the masking-and-testing requirement.
A modified stay would also shield employers from state and local laws banning vaccine and mask mandates, the administration said.
Florida is among the states that have banned businesses from requiring vaccination against COVID-19.  read more ",0

LIRA IN CRISIS AGAIN, BUT NOT A GLOBAL CONTAGION JUST YET (0917 EST/1417 GMT)
After an 11-day losing streak for the lira, the Turkish currency is now firmly in crisis territory again. The biggest concerns on investors' minds now are where is the selloff going to end and what are the chances of the contagion spreading?
Turkey's lira  plummeted nearly 15% on Tuesday, while its benchmark index (.XU100) rose 1.5% due to suddenly cheap valuations. Turkey's banks (.XBANK) have held up well so far, up 19% this month. The broader stocks index is up 17% in November having scaled record highs.
Given its limited trade and financial links with the rest of the world, alongside most emerging markets' improved external positions, economist Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics, writes that any global spillovers are unlikely. Turkish banks have $10 billion of foreign loans on their books, so domestic banking strains would not have a big impact on overseas lending.
""The way this would get uglier for the rest of the world is if President Erdogan were to hold his nerve for long enough and for the lira to fall far enough to endanger Turkey’s banks,"" writes MacAdam.
Nonetheless, some Spanish and other European banks like BBVA with Turkish exposure through its Garanti subsidiary may continue to underperform for the duration of the crisis as they did in 2018, adds the economist.

DOW INDUSTRIALS: INSIDE THE LINES (0900 EST/1400 GMT)
Over the past six months or so the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has been trapped between two log-scale trend lines:
On a weekly basis, the Dow closed above a more than 90-year resistance line in late March. With this action, the polarity of the line flipped from resistance to support. 
Since then, the Dow has bounced off of it a number of times, refusing to end a week back below it. It now resides as support around 34,000.
On the upside, the blue-chip average faces a resistance line from early 2018. This line capped strength in mid-August and again earlier this month. It now resides around 36,700. 
Meanwhile, over the past six months or so, weekly momentum has been waning. The MACD hit a more than one-year low in mid-October, and despite the Dow's early-November thrust to new highs, the momentum study managed just a tepid rise.
The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

312,"KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Taliban have formed a commission to purge ""people of bad character"" from their ranks to protect Afghanistan's reputation, the group said on Tuesday, in the latest sign it is trying to change from an insurgency into a regular government.
The Taliban operated as insurgent fighters for two decades before toppling a Western-backed government in August. Their membership has grown over the last two years, particularly after it became apparent that they would return to power in some form.
In an audio recording, Taliban deputy chief and Afghan interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said: ""We are learning that people of bad character had entered (Taliban) ranks and had been causing a bad name to the Islamic Emirate (Afghanistan) and serving their vested interests.""
""It is our humble wish that there should be a small number of people but they should be pure and sincere so that this movement should not get damaged,"" he said in the audio, whose authenticity was confirmed to Reuters by Taliban officials.
Reports on social media have alleged that people identifying themselves as Taliban members have carried out a number of attacks on civilians and former members of the security forces of the ousted government since August, despite the Taliban leadership announcing a general amnesty. Taliban officials have repeatedly denied sanctioning these acts.
Haqqani, a shadowy figure who has never been pictured in public, is also the head of the Haqqani Network that carried out some of the most brutal attacks of the 20-year insurgency.
The commission - called the commission for the purification of the ranks - has been formed under the Ministry of Defence, which is headed by Mullah Yaqoob, the son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar.
Haqqani said the commission's formation was urgently needed.
""I would like to ask our brothers to cooperate with the commission and don't protect or support any individual of bad character on the basis of personal friendship,"" Haqqani said.
The message was the latest indication of efforts the Taliban have been forced to make to adapt the movement from a guerrilla insurgency to a full civilian administration since August.

313,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Mexico's America Movil (AMXL.MX) closed the sale of its TracFone wireless unit to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the telecoms company said on Tuesday, in a deal worth more than $6 billion in cash and Verizon stock.
America Movil, controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, received more than $3.6 billion in cash from the sale of pre-paid mobile phone provider TracFone and nearly 57.6 million shares of Verizon, the company said in a statement filed to the Mexican stock exchange.
Verizon must pay an additional amount of up to $650 million in cash within two years, subject to TracFone meeting certain operation goals, America Movil said.
Shares of America Movil were up 1.9% on Tuesday afternoon.
Company officials said at an investors day event in October that after a number of transactions, including the TracFone sale, the company would reduce its net debt to EBITDA ratio and be able to expand shareholder distributions in the coming years.
Share buybacks in 2021 alone would be higher than in the past five years combined, officials said.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Monday approved Verizon's acquisition of TracFone with conditions to protect low-income consumers.
The FCC said required conditions will protect low-income consumers from price increases and require the company to continue to participate in a low-income telecommunications subsidy program called Lifeline.
The agency will require an internal and an independent compliance officer ""empowered to proactively monitor conditions, ensure that low-income consumers are not being harmed, and facilitate consumer complaints about potential violations.""
Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers. TracFone serves more than 20 million customers.
So far this year, America Movil has spent more than 31.4 billion pesos ($1.48 billion) on buybacks, according to stock exchange filings.
On Monday, it announced an increase of 26 billion pesos ($1.22 billion) in the balance of its buyback fund for the period of April 2021 to April 2022.

314,"WARSAW/STRASBOURG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Thousands of people stranded on the European Union's eastern border represent an attempt by Belarus to destabilize the bloc, rather than a migrant crisis, and as such call for a coordinated response, the head of EU executive said on Tuesday.
Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament the 27-nation bloc was standing in solidarity with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, who are bearing the brunt of what the EU says is President Alexander Lukashenko's ploy to engineer a crisis by flying in migrants into Belarus and then pushing them across EU borders.
""It is the EU as a whole that is being challenged,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is not a migration crisis. This is the attempt of an authoritarian regime to try to destabilise its democratic neighbours.""  read more 
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Warsaw's diplomatic efforts were helping reduce the numbers of migrants travelling to Belarus in the hope of entering the EU, but Poland and its neighbours warned the border crisis was far from over.
Morawiecki, speaking after meeting the leaders of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in Budapest, said Poland had been in talks with the governments of Iraq, Turkey, Uzbekistan and others.
Poland, at loggerheads with Brussels over accusations it was subverting the rule of law, has also been reaching out to its European partners.
A government spokesman tweeted Morawiecki would meet French President Emanuel Macron on Wednesday and Polish media reported plans for meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the meetings with Merkel and Johnson.
TRAVEL COMPANIES BLACKLIST
Von der Leyen said the EU was also coordinating its response to Lukashenko's challenge with its non-EU partners - the United States, Canada and Britain.
To deter intermediaries transporting migrants to Belarus from helping Minsk, the EU would create a blacklist of travel companies involved in trafficking and smuggling of migrants, she said.
It would provide the EU with a legal tool to suspend or limit the operations of companies, or even ban them from the EU if they were engaged in human trafficking, according to EU Commissioner Margaritis Schinas.
""This is not a migration crisis, this is a security crisis,"" Schinas noted. According to the EU, over 40,000 attempts to enter the EU via the Belarus border were prevented in 2021.
The EU hit Belarus with sanctions after Lukashenko's violent crackdown on protests against his disputed re-election last year, and Brussels earlier this month agreed to expand those to airlines, travel agencies and individuals involved in the movement of migrants.
CHANGE OF TACTICS
Minsk cleared migrant camps at the border and agreed to the first repatriation flights in months last week and on Tuesday reported that about 120 migrants had left on Nov. 22 and more were due to follow.
But authorities in Warsaw said repeated incidents at the border showed Minsk may have changed tactics but had not given up plans to use migrants fleeing the Middle East and other hotspots as a weapon in the stand-off with the EU.
Border Guard spokesperson Anna Michalska said about 50 migrants tried to cross on Monday evening, with 18 briefly making it across the barbed wire barrier.
Another group of similar size gathered but ultimately gave up an attempt to cross at another location.
""There are repeated attempts to cross the border and they will continue,"" Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesperson for Poland's special services, told reporters.
Polish authorities estimate about 10,000 or more migrants could be still in Belarus, he said, creating the potential for further problems.
Lukashenko, who denies the allegation that he fomented the crisis, has pressured the EU and Germany in particular to accept some migrants while Belarus repatriates others, a demand the bloc has so far flatly rejected.
Humanitarian agencies say as many as 13 migrants have died at the border, where many have suffered in a cold, damp forest with little food or water as winter sets in.
Reuters was present when Syrian siblings who had crossed into Poland from Belarus were detained by border guards near the town of Siemiatycze on Tuesday, as the first snow of the winter fell on the forests around the frontier.  read more

315,"MOSCOW/WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Russia's defence minister on Tuesday accused U.S. bombers of rehearsing a nuclear strike on Russia from two different directions earlier this month and complained that the planes had come within 20 km (12.4 miles) of the Russian border.
But the Pentagon said its drills were announced publicly at the time and adhered to international protocols.
Moscow's accusation comes at a time of high tension with Washington over Ukraine, with U.S. officials voicing concerns about a possible Russian attack on its southern neighbour - a suggestion the Kremlin has dismissed as false.
Moscow has in turn accused the United States, NATO and Ukraine of provocative and irresponsible behaviour, pointing to U.S. arms supplies to Ukraine, Ukraine's use of Turkish strike drones against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and NATO military exercises close to its borders.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that Moscow had noted a significant increase in the activity by U.S. strategic bombers, which he said had carried out 30 flights close to Russia this month. That, he said, was 2.5 times more than the same period last year.
Shoigu complained in particular of what he said was a simulated U.S. nuclear strike against Russia earlier this month.
""The defence minister underlined that during the U.S. military exercises 'Global Thunder', 10 American strategic bombers rehearsed launching nuclear weapons against Russia from the western and eastern directions,"" Shoigu was quoted as saying in a defence ministry statement.
""The minimum proximity to our state border was 20 km.""
Shoigu was quoted as saying that Russian air defence units had spotted and tracked the U.S. strategic bombers and taken unspecified measures to avoid any incidents.
The Pentagon pushed back.
""These missions were announced publicly at the time, and closely planned with (Strategic Command), (European Command), allies and partners to ensure maximum training and integration opportunities as well as compliance with all national and international requirements and protocols,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Anton Semelroth, a Pentagon spokesperson.
The top Russian and U.S. military officers, Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, spoke by telephone on Tuesday but neither side disclosed the contents of the conversation.
Global Thunder, which this year put U.S. nuclear-capable B-52 bombers through their paces, is the U.S. Strategic Command's annual nuclear and command exercise designed to test and demonstrate the readiness of U.S. nuclear capabilities.
President Vladimir Putin referenced the apparent episode briefly last week, complaining of Western strategic bombers carrying ""very serious weapons"" close to Russia. He said the West was taking Moscow's warnings not to cross its ""red lines"" too lightly.  read more 
Shoigu made the comments in a video conference with Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe. He said that U.S. bomber flights close to Russia's eastern borders were also a threat to China.
""Against this backdrop, Russo-Chinese coordination is becoming a stabilising factor in world affairs,"" said Shoigu.
Russia and China agreed at their meeting to step up cooperation between their armed forces when it came to strategic military exercises and joint patrols, the defence ministry said.",0

The SPAC vehicle, dubbed Hambro Perks Acquisition Company (HPAC), aims to raise up to 150 million pounds ($201 million) through the listing and will focus on ""high-performing"" technology companies.
The SPAC, led by CEO Dominic Perks, said it would consider a business combination with targets valued at 800 million pounds or more.
SPACs are investment vehicles that raise money on stock markets to buy private businesses, providing an easy route for the target to gain a listing without going through the rigorous process of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
Over $125 billion of SPACs have listed in the United States in 2021 so far, an unprecedented boom. Europe has only played host to handful of these vehicles, most of them in Amsterdam.
London has lagged behind in the SPAC stakes, with no listings to date, though authorities changed rules to bring them more in line with the United States to try to attract some of them to the British bourse.

The Dow is now down 2.6% from its 36,565.73 November 8 intraday high. But with the MACD remaining weak, risk remains for DJI to continue to oscillate down to once again test the support line.  read more 
Ultimately, a weekly close outside the range defined by these two lines may signal potential for acceleration. Ending back below the support line can suggest a failed breakout above a very long-term trend line, with risk then for a major reversal.

322,"GENEVA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Trade ministers are holding a conference at the World Trade Organization in Geneva for the first time in four years from Nov. 30-Dec. 3 at a critical juncture for the body.
Few expect a package of deals but Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has said she is aiming for ""at least one or two"" concrete outcomes.
Here are the main topics:
PANDEMIC RESPONSE
Okonjo-Iweala has called vaccine inequity ""unconscionable"" and given top priority to a deal to facilitate the flow of drugs and spread vaccine more widely.
But members have been deadlocked for over a year on the main item under negotiation - a potential waiver of intellectual property (IP) rights for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines sought by proponents India and South Africa along with over 100 other WTO members.
Several wealthy countries oppose a broad waiver and say there are better ways to boost vaccine-sharing, using existing IP rules.
Since a waiver would require consensus from the WTO's 164 members, it is now widely seen as out of reach, although discussions on a compromise are continuing between the European Union and South Africa.  read more 
Countries are also working on a non-binding declaration on trade and health that would aim to reduce export restrictions on medical goods, among other things, but it has faced criticism from Washington and others, delegates say.
FISHING
These negotiations are aimed at removing subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a step that environmentalists say is important to help fish stocks recover. L5N2NW6HM
But talks have been going on for 20 years and attempts at a deal failed at the last ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires in 2017. WTO deputy head Xiangchen Zhang said the fisheries outcome would be a ""critical test"" of the WTO's credibility.
Considerable disagreements remain, including over the scale of exemptions for developing countries. Colombian chair Santiago Wills is seeking to prepare a ""clean"" draft agreement for ministers. However, the latest version on Nov. 8 contained 91 pairs of square brackets that indicate undecided areas.
India has been one of the biggest critics, with trade minister Piyush Goyal slamming part of the proposals as ""unjust"" and pushing for bigger carve-outs.  read more 
Negotiators hope China, the world's largest marine fishing nation and a major subsidiser, will agree to forego the special rights it could claim as a developing country.
TRADE IN SERVICES
A group of at least 65 countries are aiming to streamline services trade through a deal that would cut red tape. Costs for trade in services are about double those for goods due to differences in regulations and procedures.
Trade experts say that this is one area where an agreement is all but certain since ministers can simply rubber-stamp a pre-agreed deal on new sectors.
Because the deal is restricted to a small group, those outside the negotiations cannot wield a veto.
Some members such as India and South Africa oppose such 'plurilateral' discussions on legal grounds.
WTO REFORM
All WTO members say the 27-year-old organisation's rule book needs updating, although they disagree on how to do so.
Most pressingly, its dispute appeals court has been paralysed for nearly two years since then-U.S. president Donald Trump's blocked new adjudicator appointments, which has quelled the appetite to seek redress of trade disputes through the WTO.
Okonjo-Iweala is pushing for members to agree a roadmap for reforming the dispute settlement procedure at the meeting.
However, delegates there is little common ground, with some members wanting only small tweaks and others, such as the United States, seeking a broad overhaul of a system described by its top trade official Katherine Tai as ""unwieldy and bureaucratic"".
AGRICULTURE
A draft agreement will be submitted to ministers ahead of the conference, but one trade source said vast gaps remained on key areas, including the form and level of allowable subsidies.
Even a seemingly uncontroversial proposal to bar countries from restricting food aid deliveries has led to a wrangle.
ENVIRONMENT
Negotiations began in 2020 and are in a preliminary phase, but some experts think the environment has the potential to give the body a new vitality and purpose.
China and the United States joined the talks this month.
A roadmap set to be adopted at the meeting aims to advance negotiations, including in contentious areas such as fossil fuel subsidies following the submission of a phase-out proposal by New Zealand.
Most delegates see this as too ambitious but, if  negotiations on cutting fisheries subsidies are successful, that could give environmental efforts some momentum.",0
323,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - From laying down the law on fossil fuel subsidies to promoting low-carbon supply chains, there is no shortage of ways in which the World Trade Organization could be at the forefront of the global fight against climate change.
The question for trade chiefs from 164 countries gathering in Geneva next week for the WTO's first ministerial conference in four years is: are they ready to give it that job?  read more 
Few doubt that trade matters to climate change. While national emissions-cutting pledges grab headlines, the reality is that the world's top economies are yoked together by a mesh of intense rivalries and interdependencies.
That means that, unless someone is setting clear and fair rules, they will fear that any unilateral move to decarbonise could be exploited by competitors for trade advantage.
""Trade was a huge subtext of a lot of what was going on at COP26,"" Carolyn Fischer, Professor of Environmental Economics of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said of U.N. talks in Glasgow this month that yielded some agreement but left climate campaigners disappointed by the extent of progress.
Many of those campaigners will be sceptical that the WTO, which has long been accused by critics of globalisation of putting free trade ahead of social concerns, should ever be trusted to have a role on climate change.
But others argue that the 27-year-old body, which is grappling with existential questions about its relevance amid mounting trade protectionism, has much to offer.
""Trade is part of the solution,"" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told COP26, saying the WTO can help big emitters like the United States, China and India to jointly work through the trade impacts of their climate plans.
Some are already using trade to support their climate goals.
The European Commission last week proposed a law to stop imports of goods ranging from soy to palm oil and furniture if their production destroys forests vital to absorbing carbon dioxide.  read more 
The EU also plans to tax the carbon contained in imports, a world first designed to protect European firms from competitors in territories with looser emissions restrictions.  read more 
A group of countries led by Costa Rica and New Zealand wants pacts to ""discipline"" the hundreds of billions of dollars of national subsidies thrown into fossil fuels, citing as an example WTO rules on farm or industrial subsidies.
GREENWASHING
All these moves raise questions to which the WTO has still not found the answers.
The EU says its border levy, due to be phased in from 2026, will be fully compatible with existing WTO rules. But trading partners including China and Russia have been hostile.
Complex global supply chains could also make it hard to identify the extent of deforestation caused by a product and so  lead to disputes which the WTO - whose appeals body has ground to a halt - would struggle to settle.
And while tackling fossil fuel subsidies should be a clear-cut WTO task, its track record in the area has been mixed.
""Folks who follow the WTO know that we've had a 20-year negotiation on trying to discipline harmful fisheries subsidies,"" University of Michigan professor Jennifer Haverkamp, a former climate negotiator, said of a trade stand-off that is jeopardising the world's fish stocks.
One role for the WTO could be to combat ""greenwashing"" by defining commonly agreed standards against which environmental claims could be tested - for example by having oversight over eco-labelling schemes.
Another would be creating tools for assessing the carbon footprint of the finished products that emerge from cross-border supply chains and in helping to establish an accurate global price for carbon - a role Okonjo-Iweala has explicitly backed.
Further down the line, severe climate change could mean dealing with massive disruptions to the global economy.
""We will need to move things from places where there is a bumper crop to places that are in drought,"" said Dmitry Grozoubinski of the Geneva Trade Platform non-profit.
""We will have to get good at moving new technologies, new ideas, goods and people across borders.""
Consensus on the WTO's role in any of the above may depend on whether trade ministers meeting next week see eye-to-eye on how they want to overhaul the body in the first place.
It would get a further boost if those ministers are able to secure a deal on reducing fisheries subsidies, because - as former WTO director-general Pascal Lamy has noted - it would show a political will to address environmental concerns.
Some suggest that defining a clear role on climate change is a credibility issue for the WTO.
""They've been talking about green goods and services for a long time,"" said Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam's Fischer. ""Making progress there would help demonstrate the relevance of the WTO and trade towards sustainability.""",0
324,"MILAN, Italy, Nov 23 (Reuters) - AC Milan coach Stefano Pioli has called on his side to turn their impressive Champions League performances into results as the seven-time European Cup winners head into Wednesday's trip to Atletico Madrid needing to win at all costs.
Competing in their first Champions League competition since 2013-14, Milan sit bottom of Group B with one point from four matches, four points behind second-placed Porto, who travel to already-qualified leaders Liverpool on Wednesday.
Milan have put in some notable displays - going toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield before losing 3-2, while two late goals earned Atletico a 2-1 win at San Siro - but Pioli knows they need results to qualify for the knockout stages.
""We are hardened for this, built to be competitive,"" he told a news conference on Tuesday. ""For many players it's the first time in the Champions League. We've found opponents of the highest level, but we've shown we are not too far from them.
""We're aware that we've always lacked a little something when it mattered most. We need to know for tomorrow night that we need to perform with quality and attention in the two penalty areas, otherwise the performance is worthless.
""My task in preparing the team for tomorrow is quite simple: it is the last chance to stay in the Champions League.""
Milan have started the Serie A season in fine form, going unbeaten in their opening 12 games.
They did suffer their first league defeat of the campaign in a 4-3 thriller at Fiorentina on Saturday but Pioli does not believe that will have a big effect on his team. 
""We lost in Florence because in the two penalty areas we weren't as precise as in the past,"" he added.
""We had less concentration and quality than usual. It's not a question of approach, we have played better than other games.
""Unfortunately we didn't score, but this is football.""",0
325,"MOSCOW, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Ilya Sachkov, the head of a Russian cybersecurity firm, on Tuesday appealed to President Vladimir Putin to let him be moved to house arrest while he awaits trial on treason charges after his detention was extended until February.
Sachkov, 35, who founded Group-IB, one of Russia's most prominent cybersecurity firms, was arrested in September and charged with divulging state secrets, allegations he denies.
Moscow's Lefortovo district court said on Tuesday Sachkov's detention had been extended by three months to Feb. 28, 2022.
In a statement sent by his lawyer on Tuesday, Sachkov again rejected the charges and compared his case to the Dreyfus affair, a political scandal that shook France more than a century ago.
""I am not a traitor, a spy or a turncoat. I am a Russian engineer. Through my work I have repeatedly proven my loyalty and benefit to the motherland,"" Sachkov said in the statement, given to Reuters by his lawyer Sergei Afanasiev.
""I very much ask my president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, to allow me to spend the duration of the investigation under house arrest, with maximum restrictions.""
When asked whether Putin had received such a request, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: ""I don't know anything about that.""
Afanasiev said Sachkov denied the charges but had agreed to answer questions from investigators. He is visited by lawyers once a week and receives mail with a delay of two to three weeks, Afanasiev said.
Sachkov's mother Lyudmila has previously urged the president to have her son released, calling him ""a sincere patriot"" in a letter in early October.
The Kremlin at the time said the letter had not reached the presidential administration and it was a matter for the court.
Treason is punishable by up to 20 years in jail. The details of such cases are rarely made public because of their classified nature.
Group-IB focuses on investigating high-tech crimes and online fraud, with a global client base that includes banks, energy companies, telecoms firms and Interpol.",0
326,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Bank of England needs to be vigilant about rising labour costs as a tight job market means wages might rise faster than productivity and put upward pressure on inflation, BoE policymaker Jonathan Haskel said on Tuesday.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey says interest rates are likely to go up and investors see a 90% chance of a hike in December.
Financial markets were wrong-footed earlier this month when seven of the BoE's nine rate-setters - including Haskel - opted to wait for more job market data before raising borrowing costs.
In a speech to students at the University of Glasgow's Adam Smith Business School, Haskel said much of the recent rise in inflation was due to global factors such as imported goods and energy prices that were likely to drop out of the figures.
He said he was in ""team transitory"" on the question of inflation's persistence. However, there was a risk that wage growth could exceed productivity growth, which has been weak in Britain for more than a decade.
""The latest data continues to indicate a tight labour market, putting upward pressure on wages. From a living standards point of view, this is of course excellent news, but from an inflation point of view this has to be matched by increased productivity and so we have to be vigilant,"" he said.
RECORD VACANCIES
""Buoyant"" jobs data recently suggested that a scenario where demand for labour petered out and recovery stalled looked unlikely now, he said, but it was too soon to tell how well job-seekers' skills matched the record-high number of vacancies.
Haskel gave few clues about the short-term outlook for rates and said their longer-term path - rather than which month borrowing costs begin to rise - was more relevant for most businesses and members of the public.
""Lots of people are very fixated on month-by-month or meeting-by-meeting potential changes in rates. But ... that's not really what the majority of people ... are interested in.""
The outright size of the economy - which has not yet recovered to its pre-pandemic level - was also important for monetary policy, alongside the health of the labour market.
Market expectations for increases in BoE rates over the coming year reflected a stronger economic outlook than during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, Haskel said.
""The prospective rise in Bank Rate from its emergency level – whenever that comes - is not a bug, but a feature. It reflects the success of fiscal, health and science policy in dealing with worst economic shock in 100 years,"" he said.",0
327,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Britain will allow privately-held oil reserves to be released voluntarily in answer to a global stockpile release effort led by the United States, a UK government spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.
""If all companies chose to use this flexibility it would release the equivalent of 1.5 million barrels of oil,"" the spokesperson said.
""This does not impact UK oil reserves which are significantly above the 90 days required by the (International Energy Agency).""",0
328,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it would release 50 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves in a coordinated move with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain to cool prices after OPEC+ producers rebuffed calls for more crude.
The move is intended to lower fuel costs and serve as a warning to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as the U.S. and other major consumers believe high prices could undermine the global economy's efforts to recover from the pandemic.
The United States plans to release 50 million barrels in a combined loan and sale, while other nations haven't released all of the details of their plans.
While the United States and its allies have coordinated oil reserve releases before, this is the first time they have involved China. Notably, the unprecedented move does not directly involve the Paris-based International Energy Agency, of which the United States is a member, and China an affiliate.
The 30-member IEA was founded in 1974 as an energy watchdog, and its website lists one of its major roles as helping ""coordinate a collective response to major disruptions in the supply of oil"". However, the IEA says its emergency response efforts are not meant to respond to rising prices.
There have been three previous emergency releases coordinated by the IEA. This would be the first notable global release not spearheaded by the organization.
The United States also periodically releases oil on its own, sometimes through Congressionally legislated sales.
However, Washington has also released from its strategic reserve through exchange agreements, similar to loans, with private companies, often in the wake of local natural disasters. The companies have to repay by a certain date, with additional premium barrels as interest.",0
329,"SARAJEVO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Thousands of miners halted work at Bosnia's seven coal mines on Tuesday in support of colleagues protesting in Sarajevo against what they said were government violations of work and pay regulations.
The seven coal mines are owned by the state-owned Elektroprivreda BiH (EPBiH) power utility, and employ about 7,200 workers.
The government of Bosnia's autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, which owns the EPBiH, plans to restructure indebted coal mines as part of its plan to switch gradually from coal to renewable energy sources, and cut the number of employees to 5,200.  read more 
The restructuring plan, including the retirement of 419 miners this year, was agreed by both sides in May.
But now the EPBiH has imposed new working regulations that violate the collective bargaining agreement, slashing the miners' basic wage to 570 Bosnian marka (291 euro) from 850 marka, Sinan Husic, the president of the Federation miners' union, told Reuters.
Nobody from the government or EPBiH was immediately available for comment.
Several thousand miners, who were bussed to Sarajevo from across Bosnia, blew whistles, waved flags and shouted ""thieves, thieves"".
The union representatives refused to talk to the government and EPBiH officials but insisted they should come out and address the protesters.
But when Federation Industry and Energy Minister Nermin Dzindic tried to talk to the protesters, surrounded by special police, he was booed and quickly left.
""A key reason is that they want to reduce our basic salary, to pay us according to the output, which is unrealistic,"" said Admir Fejzic, a miner from the largest Kreka coal mine in northern Bosnia.",0

331,"ABUJA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 11.5% for a seventh straight time on Tuesday but cited persistent insecurity in large parts of the country as a major downside risk to the recovery of Africa's biggest economy.
Governor Godwin Emefiele said the decision to keep rates steady was unanimously supported by members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
""MPC believes that the existing policy stance has supported growth recovery and should be allowed to continue for a little longer,"" Emefiele said.
Nigeria's economic rebound, after a COVID-19-induced recession in 2020, was being driven by fiscal and monetary interventions, he said.
Africa's largest economy grew just over 4% in the third quarter, its fourth consecutive quarterly rise.
However, the security situation in Nigeria was hampering business confidence and foreign investor sentiment, Emefiele said.
Nigeria is battling an Islamist insurgency in the northeast and a spate of kidnappings for ransom in the north and northwest.
""The persistency of insecurity ... remains a key downside risk to our recovery. The committee calls on the security agencies in the country to increase their presence in order to boost full confidence and the movement of people, goods and services across the country,"" Emefiele said.
Nigeria had been grappling with low growth before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a recession and created large financing gaps including dollar shortages and inflation.
Few expected the central bank to alter interest rates after it cut them a year ago.
Virág Fórizs, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the central bank's ""case to tighten monetary policy has weakened with inflation dropping back in recent months, especially as the rebound in economic activity seems to be fading.""
On Tuesday, the World Bank called for tighter monetary policy to attract private investment, citing that the naira's black market premium was fueling inflation, in addition to the central bank's financing of the government's deficit.",0

DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
""Today's release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an important policy band-aid for rising gas prices but does not solve for the self-inflicted wound that shortsighted energy policy is having on our nation. With an energy transition underway across the country, it is critical that Washington does not jeopardize America's energy security in the near term and leave consumers vulnerable to rising prices. Historic inflation, taxes and the lack of a comprehensive all-of-the-above energy policy pose a clear and present threat to American's economic and energy security that can no longer be ignored.

U.S. SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO, RANKING REPUBLICAN ON SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
""President Biden’s policies are hiking inflation and energy prices for the American people. Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will not fix the problem. We are experiencing higher prices because the administration and Democrats in Congress are waging a war on American energy.
""President Biden has either eliminated or severely restricted access to America's oil and natural gas resources on federal lands and waters. At the urging of Democrats and environmental activists the investment banking industry has also withheld capital from companies looking to produce U.S. oil and natural gas. Begging OPEC and Russia to increase production and now using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve are desperate attempts to address a Biden-caused disaster. They're not substitutes for American energy production.""
DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER CHARLES SCHUMER
""President Biden’s announcement is good news for American families and will strengthen our economy. Tapping the SPR will provide much-needed temporary relief at the pump and will signal to OPEC that they cannot recklessly manipulate supply to artificially inflate gas prices.

""You don’t tap our emergency oil reserves because of stupid policies. Using SPR as the mechanism to alleviate the high gas prices, caused by the Biden Administration’s poor decision-making, is the wrong approach. We must resume using the resources we have, not doubling down on stupid and exacerbating a crisis with another bad policy.""
DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE ANN KUSTER
""I’m glad to see @POTUS take this step to lower oil and gas prices as we head into the holidays. Global demand has been exceeding supply which has driven up prices, and the United States is working alongside other countries that are facing rising prices to lower costs.""

""We were energy independent one year ago, now we are at the mercy of OPEC, gasoline is selling for $7 in parts of California, going up all over the Country, and they are taking oil from our Strategic Reserves. Is this any way to run a Country?""
U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SENIOR V.P. CHRISTOPHER GUITH
""America’s real strategic petroleum reserve is in places like the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Energy’s reserve should only be used for supply disruptions. Instead of ineffectual band aids, the White House should focus on policies that will encourage domestic production of oil and natural gas. Rather, all the Administration has done is threaten energy production on federal lands, cancel pipelines and beg Saudi Arabia and Russia for more oil. It’s time to unleash America’s full potential to meet the world’s energy needs.""",0
333,"KABUL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Taliban administration has released a set of restrictions on Afghan media, including banning television dramas that included female actors and ordering women news presenters to wear ""Islamic hijab"".
Afghanistan's Ministry of Vice and Virtue set out nine rules this week, a Taliban administration spokesman said on Tuesday, largely centred on banning any media that contravened ""Islamic or Afghan values"".
Some edicts were targeted specifically at women, a move likely to raise concerns among the international community.
""Those dramas...or programmes in which women have acted, should not be aired,"" the rules said, adding that female journalists on air should wear ""Islamic hijab"" without defining what that meant.
Though most women in Afghanistan wear headscarves in public, the Taliban's statements that women should wear ""Islamic hijab"" have often in the past worried women's rights activists who say the term is vague and could be interpreted conservatively.
The rules drew criticism from international rights watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW), which said media freedom was deteriorating in the country.
""The disappearance of any space for dissent and worsening restrictions for women in the media and arts is devastating,"" said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW, in a statement.
Though Taliban officials have sought to sought to publicly assure women and the international community that women's rights will be protected since they took over Afghanistan on Aug. 15, many advocates and women have remained skeptical.
During the Taliban's previous rule, strict curbs were placed on women's ability to leave the house, unless accompanied by a male relative, or to receive education.",0

Under the proposed law, at least 6% of the streaming platforms' catalogue must be in Spain's co-official languages - Catalan, Galician or Basque - and the platforms will have to assume the cost, the government source told a media briefing.
That quota would include, for example, original content in Catalan but it is unclear if content produced in Spanish and dubbed in Catalan would qualify, the source said, adding those details would be defined later.
The 6% threshold comes under a broader requirement that 30% of the platforms' content is produced in Europe, with 9% in Spanish
Spain's cabinet is set to rubber stamp the draft law in the coming weeks before sending it to parliament, where it is expected to be approved in 2022 and come into full force in 2023, the source said.
The language quotas introduced in the law come in exchange for Catalan separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya's (ERC) critical support for Spain's leftist coalition government's 2022 budget bill, which will be voted this week.
ERC said earlier on Tuesday the audiovisual law would include a 5% tax on private platforms, but the government source said it did not have any information in that regard.
Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.
The law will also require platforms to include content that has already been translated or subtitled in a regional Spanish language - for instance by a TV channel - but only if that is technically and financially possible, the economy ministry source said.",0
339,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Holders Spain finally get the chance to try and retain their Davis Cup crown when the competition resumes in yet another new format across three European cities this week with all eyes on teenager Carlos Alcaraz in the absence of Rafa Nadal.
Two years ago in the inaugural edition of the revamped team event, a Nadal-inspired Spain claimed the title after an exhausting week in Madrid's Caja Magica.
The pandemic scuppered last year's 18-nation Davis Cup Finals and since then the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and partners Kosmos Tennis have moved to make the event more manageable, with Turin and Innsbruck added as co-hosts.
Starting on Thursday, the 18 finalists will compete in six groups of three with eight qualifying for the knockout rounds and the final taking place in Madrid on Dec. 5.
The spectre of COVID-19 has returned, however, and the two groups being staged in Innsbruck will have no fans cheering them on after Austria's reintroduction of a lockdown.
Impossibly late finishes to ties (comprising of two singles and a doubles) and smallish crowds for some matches tarnished what was an encouraging debut for the revamped Davis Cup Finals in Madrid in 2019, which is why it has been expanded to 10 days across three nations this time.
But Spain will feel right at home with Group A, which also includes a powerful Russian team and Ecuador, in Madrid.
They will not have talisman Nadal though as he continues his recovery from a foot injury. Instead, the focus will be on Alcaraz, the 18-year-old being tipped as the player most likely to fill the void when 20-time Grand Slam champion Nadal retires.
Alcaraz will be making his debut in the competition and will be joined by Roberto Bautista Agut, one of the heroes of 2019 when Spain beat Canada in the final, as well as Pablo Carreno Busta, Feliciano Lopez and Marcel Granollers.
""It was a dream that I had since I was a child and being able to make my debut is super beautiful and super special,"" Alcaraz, the world number 32, said this week.
""It will be a difficult challenge because only one team definitely gets through in the group and Russia has a great team, but I trust a lot in the Spanish team.""
Spain begin on Friday against Ecuador.
RUSSIA FAVOURITES
On paper Russia look favourites, with world number two Daniil Medvedev and world number five Andrey Rublev spearheading their challenge, but Serbia will have world number one Novak Djokovic in their ranks in Group F in Innsbruck.
Serbia are up against Austria and a Germany side missing their top player Alexander Zverev.
""The (Olympiahalle) arena is great. It's a pity that we can't have an audience,"" Austria's Dennis Novak said.
""We have been looking forward to this week for one and a half years -- so now we'll give our all.""
Britain, semi-finalists in 2019, are without Andy Murray but with in-form Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans they will be confident of progressing from Group C which also consists of France and the Czech Republic.
The United States, Davis Cup champions a record 32 times, are in Group E in Turin alongside Italy and Colombia.
Australia's Group D will also be in Turin with the Davis Cup heavyweights up against Croatia and Hungary while Group B contains Canada, Sweden and Kazakhstan.",0
340,"LIMA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Shares of Hochschild Mining (HOCM.L) were down around 8% on Tuesday, after collapsing 27% a day earlier after Peru's government indicated that it would not approve operational extensions for its flagship Inmaculada silver mine.
The slide continued despite a crunch meeting late on Monday between the government and the powerful National Society of Mining, Energy and Oil, which both sides said had been ""very productive.""  read more 
Peru's prime minister, Mirtha Vasquez, sparked anger in the sector and triggered the Hochschild sell-off when she said on Friday that several mines would not be granted further operational extensions due to environmental concerns.
Leftist President Pedro Castillo is looking to shake up the Andean nation's huge mining sector after pledging to redistribute mineral profits more evenly and empower local indigenous groups and farming communities.
His government has tried to strike a balance between community demands and encouraging mining operations, key for growth in the world's No. 2 producer of copper and silver.
Hochschild's shares had plummeted as much as 57% on Monday, before recouping some losses, but it was still the worst trading day ever for the London-listed miner's shares.
Amid uncertainty in the sector, Peru's vice minister of mines has also appeared to leave room open for a reprieve, saying that the ""door is not closed"" and that mining firms could present their cases for extension.",0
341,"MUMBAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The transition to clean energy will primarily be financed by the private sector as a standardised framework of reporting climate credentials for companies across the globe is established, investors and think tanks said.
These investments are likely to come from sources such as funds leveraged through banks and the private sector, institutional investors, debt financing and developed country finance, they told the Reuters Global Markets Forum last week.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates energy transition technologies will need investments of around $131 trillion by 2050.
Around 80% of this is expected to come from the private sector, with debt financing growing to a 60% share within that, IRENA deputy director-general Gauri Singh said.
Gero Farruggio, head of global renewables at Rystad Energy, believes companies will lead.
Big Tech companies that provide solutions to energy storage and are investing significantly on the technology side, along with corporations that are driving power purchase agreements are ones to watch, Farruggio said.
""Climate change is a systemic risk to all investors,"" said Karen Wong, head of ESG and sustainable investing at State Street Global Advisors, which manages nearly $3.9 trillion in assets.
Investors are aligning their portfolios to net zero, working  with other funds and engaging with companies through ""stewardship"" and proxy-voting to integrate climate goals, she said.
A Barclays Private Bank survey of over 300 respondents, on average managing $833 million in assets, expects the share of impact investing within portfolios to reach 54% by 2027, from 41% this year.
Meanwhile, investors believe public finance will continue to play a vital role in creating risk mitigation mechanisms for renewable energy projects, to further leverage and unlock private investments.
GLOBAL STANDARDISATION
The new rules on carbon markets agreed upon at the United Nations COP26 climate conference would ""provide some guidance,"" said Philip Gass, lead for transitions, Energy Programme at the International Institute for Sustainable Development.
Investors expect the standardised framework, being formulated by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), to target the reduction of greenhouse gases, predictive emissions, and carbon capture and storage (CCS).
But they said harmonised accountability and transparency in how companies measure and report sustainability will be key, especially as around 70% of green capital expenditure over the next 30 years is expected to happen in emerging markets.
""We can only manage what we can measure ... Standardisation (would) help address one of the biggest barriers to decarbonisation,"" Wong said.
As more companies report on a standardised framework, investors will get more robust and comparable data, said Wong, which will ""drive more sustainable investing in developing countries.""",0
342,"DUBLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The case for European Central Bank monetary policy action will become stronger if current inflation trends persist but incoming data do not show evidence of such an outcome, Governing Council member Gabriel Makhlouf said on Tuesday.
Inflation in the euro zone hit 4.1% in October, pushed up by higher energy costs, and is expected to stay above the ECB's 2% target next year as suppliers strained by the pandemic cannot keep up with the reopening of the economy.
Makhlouf, Ireland's central bank chief, said the ECB must be conscious of the effects of tightening policy, when recovery from the pandemic remains highly uncertain and that the wrong monetary policy action today could prove more costly than risks stemming from current spike in inflation.
However he said policymakers cannot afford to be complacent.
""We need to recognise that there are risks to the inflation outlook. If current trends in inflation persist, the case for monetary policy action becomes stronger,"" Makhlouf said in a speech published on the Irish central bank website.
""Incoming data do not currently show evidence that would lead us to think that inflation pressures are becoming persistent, but this could evolve and we must remain vigilant and cognisant of the risks.""
The ECB is due to decide at its Dec. 16 meeting on the future of its two bond-purchase programmes - one launched in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the other in 2015.
Makhlouf said given the remarkable levels of uncertainty in the global economy, the ECB should keep its options open regarding its policy tools and ""not lock ourselves into commitments that put our price stability objective at risk.""
He added that recent euro zone data does not suggest - ""at least thus far"" - that higher inflation is feeding into broad-based higher wage demands, a key trend policymakers are monitoring.",0

344,"JERUSALEM, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel is in no rush to raise interest rates as inflation remains under control, and will not pre-announce how much foreign currency it might buy to curb shekel appreciation, Governor Amir Yaron told Reuters.
On Monday, the bank held its benchmark interest rate (ILINR=ECI) at 0.1% for a 13th meeting, citing expectations inflation will ease in the coming year even as the economy rebounds from the pandemic.
Inflation dipped to 2.3% in October from September's eight-year high of 2.5% despite bottlenecks and supply chain difficulties that are affecting Israel like other countries.
""We still have a very accommodative monetary policy,"" Yaron said in an interview, adding that the central bank had ""more degrees of freedom"" to maintain that stance as annual inflation is expected to stay within its 1-3% target range.
Describing inflation as an ""inverted U"", Yaron said economic conditions did not point to a sustained rise, so ""we don't see a need to rush in anywhere in terms of our monetary action"".
Analysts are split over when rates will rise, with some expecting a hike next year and others not until 2023.
Inflation, which only turned positive in March, has stabilised partly due to a stronger shekel, which makes imported goods cheaper. Yaron rejected the idea that the central bank was allowing the shekel to appreciate to bring down inflation.
He said Israel was in a different position to countries like the Czech Republic which have already hiked rates, noting: ""Their inflation is quite markedly ahead of their targets. And that is a significant difference from where we are.""
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Israel reopened its economy in March after a world-leading vaccine rollout and the central bank last month estimated economic growth of 7% in 2021, although Yaron said it could be lower after a weaker third quarter.
""We haven't done the complete analysis but you're still in the 6%-plus,"" he said. ""We are seeing lots of signs for a strong economy.""
Growth should remain robust ""as long as there are no variants completely resistant to vaccination"".
The labour market remains a downside even though the broadest measure of unemployment has fallen to 7%, and Yaron called on the government to provide more training for people whose jobs have been lost to structural change.
Israel's economy has shifted over time from manufacturing to services, led by the booming technology sector.
""We're not trying to change the trend,"" Yaron said of the strong shekel. ""We're trying to allow the economy to adjust to the changes.""
He said the central bank would continue to intervene occasionally in markets to prevent big movements in the shekel, although there ""there is no need to announce a specific figure"".
""We are in what I would call back to a more discretionary approach,"" Yaron said, after the bank bought $30 billion of foreign currency this year under a plan outlined in January.
The shekel  has been the best-performing emerging currency during the pandemic, having risen around 10% since 2020. It hit a 26-year high of 3.04 per dollar last week.
That reflects tech sector inflows, Israel's large current account surplus and stock market gains that have forced pension funds and other institutions to cap their forex exposures, but has angered exporters.
The shekel weakened to 3.13 per dollar from 3.11 after Yaron's comments.
Yaron said shekel gains were based on economic fundamentals but that the central bank wanted to ensure adjustments were gradual so that companies do not make ""irreversible decisions just because of too sharp movements"".
He welcomed the passing of a 2021-2022 budget this month, the first since 2019, saying it included long-due reforms and did not impose fiscal constraints. But the government must address a high structural deficit in 2023 and 2024.
Yaron said Israel's sovereign wealth fund should begin operating in 2022, while the central bank may make recommendations on inflation-targeting.",0
345,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two giant U.S. commodity traders bought soybeans in Brazil from farmers trying to evict a traditional community from South America's largest savanna, where deforestation is hastening global warming, watchdog group Global Witness found on Tuesday.
The Brazilian grains producers, who say they bought the disputed land legally, have been fighting in court since 2017 to evict the Capao do Modesto people from part of the Cerrado, where the cattle herders say they have lived for 200 years.
Severino de Oliveira, a member of the Capao do Modesto, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation his people's way of life was under threat, accusing the farmers of destroying cattle fences and using security guards to intimidate the community.
""(My children) know that if we lose this land, we'll end up (homeless) under the bridge in Correntina,"" said de Oliveira, who declined to publish his real name for fear of retaliation, referring to a nearby town in Brazil's northeastern Bahia state.
""We used to live a quiet life, we slept with our doors open. Now, we sleep on alert for any suspicious noise.""
Global efforts to stop climate change and deforestation have focused on the Amazon, but the Cerrado is disappearing nearly four-times faster, accounting for relative size, with forests and grasslands being turned into farms, pasture and towns.
Global grain traders in 2006 agreed to stop buying soybeans from newly deforested Amazon jungle areas. But Brazil - the world's largest soybean exporter - has made no similar push to preserve the Cerrado, another vital ecological zone.
MONEY TRANSFERS
Money transfers seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation show that during 2017 and 2018 Cargill paid 880,000 reais ($268,000 at the exchange rate on Dec 31, 2017) to soybean producer Agropecuaria Sementes Talisma, one of seven claimants in the case.
Another grains trader, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (ADM), paid the same company 530,000 reais ($162,000 at the exchange rate on Nov 30, 2017), the transfers show.
""These business relationships directly link international traders as contributors to the abuse and victimisation of the Capao do Modesto community,"" Global Witness said in its report.
""Despite public commitments to sustainability and due diligence, these international traders are profiting from land conflicts and human rights abuses.""
Cargill confirmed in emailed comments that it had bought soybeans from Talisma in 2016 and 2017, but said it no longer had a commercial relationship with the firm.
""We had negotiations with Agropecuaria Sementes Talisma in the crops of 2016 and 2017, however in compliance with our commitments, this company was blocked on our systems for presenting embargoed areas,"" it said.
In 2011, Talisma was put on a Brazilian government list of firms that have broken environmental law because it prevented or hindered ""the natural regeneration of forests or other forms of native vegetation"".
ADM said it had launched an investigation after receiving a letter from Global Witness alleging that suppliers in its supply chain in Bahia were responsible for irregularities that violated its purchasing policies in the area of ​​human rights.
""The investigation found no irregularities in the points raised under local law or with ADM's policies by such suppliers, which have commercial relationships to obtain commodities,"" ADM said in emailed comments.
While the land dispute has been reported before, it is the first time a link has been made to the U.S. firms, highlighting the challenges of ensuring human rights and environmental due diligence in global supply chains.
'GREEN LAND GRABBING'
Supporters of the Capao say the case is part of a growing trend of ""green land grabbing"" - where farmers illegally acquire forest or other undeveloped land, not to turn it into fields or cattle ranches, but to keep it as a nature reserve.
By law, every rural property owner in Brazil must set aside between 20% and 80% of their land, depending on the region, to maintain tree cover to combat climate change, regulate rainfall and prevent flooding.
Through ""green land grabbing"", or ""grilagem"" in Portuguese,  landowners can deforest a higher percentage of their legitimately owned properties by counting the illegally acquired land as their nature reserve.
In the ongoing case involving the Capao, the seven agricultural producers say they own and are maintaining 9,421 hectares (23,280 acres) of land as a nature reserve.
""Talisma acquired these properties in 2008. These lands were never occupied by residents, only by a group of people who tried to invade, degrade and release cattle in a place destined for environmental preservation,"" the firm said in emailed comments.
""Capao's case is one of green land grabbing,"" said environmentalist Marcos Rogerio Beltrao, a member of another traditional community in Bahia who researches land rights in the Cerrado.
""They have lived in this area for centuries ... but now are being branded as invaders.""
In Bahia state court documents seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the agricultural producers said the Capao invaded their land and were damaging it with their cattle.
AATR, a lawyers' association representing the Capao, denied this.
""Their impact on the environment is minimal. The cattle are dispersed along a very large area,"" it said.
Establishing the legality of a land claim can be hard in Brazil, because many people manufacture fake deeds.
In this case, there are two conflicting title deeds.
Talisma presented a deed of sale to the court showing that it acquired the land in 2008 from a couple who signed with their thumb prints.
But a different company, Agropecuaria Onca Pintada, an agricultural producer not involved in the eviction case, also presented a document showing it has owned the same plot since 1989.
For Valney Dias Rigonato, a land rights researcher at the Federal University of the West of Bahia, the case illustrates how growing demand for farmland in Brazil is putting pressure on the survival of traditional communities like the Capao.
""They do an amazing job at managing their lands. It's in those areas that the Cerrado is still standing, where there's still biodiversity,"" said Rigonato.
""Now their way of life, and their sacred territory is under threat because someone came with a map and said to them: you're on land that belongs to me.""

Frustrated by the slow pace of antitrust investigations, Vestager late last year proposed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which sets out a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants designated as online gatekeepers.
Gatekeepers are companies with at least 8 billion euros ($9 billion) in European turnover and an 80 billion euro market capitalisation. The rules need to be thrashed out with the European Parliament and EU countries before they can be adopted.
A Parliamentary committee, drafting lawmakers' negotiating position on the issue, voted for a tougher line that could also see travel website booking.com, China's Alibaba and online retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE) classified as gatekeepers.
The group also extended the scope of the DMA to web browsers, virtual assistants and connected TV, from Vestager's list of online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing and video-sharing services.
It also wants to empower the European Commission to temporarily halt so-called killer acquisitions by gatekeepers, or takeovers aimed at shutting down nascent rivals.
Targeted advertising would be allowed with the consent of users, but banned for minors.
Breaches of the rules would result in fines of between 4% to 20% of a company's global turnover, compared with Vestager's proposed 10%.
""Great news! Today's @EP_SingleMarket vote brings us one step closer to the DMA's adoption. One step closer to a free, fair and competitive Tech market where all players stand a chance to make it,"" Vestager tweeted.
""We do not want bigger companies getting bigger and bigger without getting any better and at the expense of consumers and the European economy,"" lawmaker Andreas Schwab said.
Tech lobbying group CCIA warned of one-size-fits-all legislation.
""The lack of any impact assessment of the Parliament's amendments take the DMA deeper into unknown territory creating significant risks of unintended consequences for Europe's digital economy,"" its competition lawyer Kayvan Hazemi-Jebelli said.

348,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures jumped almost 4% on Tuesday, erasing most of Monday's 5% drop, as soaring global gas prices keep demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports near record highs.
Gas prices in Europe  soared about 7% on Tuesday as colder weather increased demand and the market remained nervous about winter supplies from Russia.
In recent months, global gas prices hit record highs as utilities around the world scrambled for LNG cargoes to replenish extremely low stockpiles in Europe and meet insatiable demand in Asia, where energy shortfalls have caused power blackouts in China.
Following those global gas prices, U.S. futures jumped to a 12-year high in early October, but have since pulled back because the United States has plenty of gas in storage and ample production for the winter. Overseas prices continue to trade about six times higher than U.S. futures.
Analysts have said European inventories were about 17% below normal for this time of year, compared with just 2% below normal in the United States.
U.S. front-month gas futures  rose 17.8 cents, or 3.7%, to settle at $4.967 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). On Monday, the contract settled at its lowest since Sept. 7.
In the spot market, gas prices for Tuesday in New York  and New England  jumped to their highest since the February freeze as temperatures in the U.S. Northeast dropped and homes and businesses cranked up their heaters. The February freeze cut U.S. gas production and left millions of consumers without power and heat for days in Texas and other Central U.S. states.
High temperatures in Boston, the biggest city in New England, were only expected to reach about 43 degrees Fahrenheit (6 Celsius) on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to meteorologists at AccuWeather. That compares with a normal high of 49 degrees at this time of year.
Data provider Refinitiv said output in the U.S. Lower 48 states averaged 96.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in November, up from 94.1 bcfd in October and a monthly record of 95.4 bcfd in November 2019.
Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 111.2 bcfd this week to 112.6 bcfd next week as the weather turns seasonally colder and homes and businesses crank up their heaters. The forecast for next week, however, was lower than Refinitiv's forecast on Monday.
The amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants has averaged 11.2 bcfd so far in November, up from 10.5 bcfd in October as the sixth train at Cheniere Energy Inc's (LNG.A) Sabine Pass plant in Louisiana started producing LNG in test mode. That compares with a monthly record of 11.5 bcfd in April.  read more

349,"ISTANBUL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan has set Turkey's $720-billion economy on a risky new path of aggressive interest rate cuts that he says will boost jobs, exports and growth and paradoxically stem soaring inflation and a currency meltdown.
Erdogan orchestrated the policy shift as his opinion polls slide ahead of elections due by mid-2023. Economists have ridiculed the ""experiment"" as reckless and a recipe for eroding Turks' earnings and savings, given the resulting market crash.
Here are the main elements of the strategy that has taken shape in speeches and policy decisions since September:
EMPHASIZE EXPORTS AND BALANCE THE CURRENT ACCOUNT
The central bank, under pressure from Erdogan, has slashed its policy rate by 400 basis points to 15% since September. The easing sparked a 33% drop in the lira versus the dollar, boosted inflation via imports, and set Turkey well apart in a world in which other central banks are tightening to stem price rises.
On Oct. 28, Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu offered an unexpected explanation: one of the best ways to bring Turkey's 20% inflation down to a 5% target is to flip the ""unsustainable"" current account deficit to surplus. ""When we achieve ... surplus we will achieve financial and price stability,"" Kavcioglu, whom Erdogan installed in March, said at a quarterly inflation update.  read more 
Exports surged 20% to $21 billion last month, outstripping imports and helping drive recent trade surpluses, even though the 12-month current account remains in the red. Benefiting from the lira weakness, exports of machinery, cars and textiles have set the economy on a path to near 10% overall growth this year.
Yet this sector represents only one slice of the economy and hinges on global demand, tempering any immediate broader benefit for households. Economists also say competitive structural reforms over several years are needed to rebalance an economy that is heavily reliant on imports and foreign funding, including $167 billion in short-term external debt due.
LIRA DEPRECIATION IS A TOUGH BUT NECESSARY ADJUSTMENT
The currency has plunged 20% since the beginning of last week alone. That's the sort of dislocation that might typically prompt emergency measures to stem the bleeding, but there has been no tangible intervention from the government, regulators or central bank.
Erdogan has addressed the foreign exchange turmoil in two speeches, including on Monday when he vowed to carry on his battle against interest rates and urged Turks to see the devaluation in a different and more positive light.
""The competitive force of the exchange rate leads to increase in investment, production and employment,"" he said, adding the country's enemies have ""played games"" over the lira in the past only to fail. ""Just as we took our country out of this many traps and misfortunes, with the help of Allah and the support of our people, we will emerge victorious from this economic war of independence,"" Erdogan said.
PROVE TO DOUBTERS THAT RATE CUTS BRING INFLATION DOWN
Erdogan has long espoused the unorthodox view that high interest rates cause inflation. He has imposed this view on the central bank, firing three central bank governors in the last 2-1/2 years, leaving its credibility in tatters. The recent rate cuts are the most high-stakes test of his theory.
""We saw that the theory that inflation can be brought down only with monetary tightening has no basis other than in closed economies,"" he said on Monday. ""I reject policies that will contract our country in the way that ... economists desire, weaken it, condemn our people to unemployment, hunger and poverty.""
Devlet Bahceli, leader of the nationalist party MHP that is allied with Erdogan's conservative AK Party, said on Tuesday there is ""no alternative"" to cutting rates. ""Turkey needs to rid itself from the hunchback of interest rates,"" he said. ""We are aware of the problems our people are facing, we see the complaints over the exchange rate, but the policies being implemented are correct. Soon, everything will be fine.""
EXPAND STATE-BANK CREDIT TO BOOST JOBS AND INVESTMENT
Private Turkish lenders are hesitant to boost credit given risks of stoking a hot economy and possible company defaults. But the big three state banks have followed the central bank's lead and slashed borrowing costs in line with the easing.
""As they have done until now, our banks will continue to stand beside our customers and companies, contributing to the strengthening of our country's economy and employment,"" the banks said in a joint statement last month after cutting rates on loans by up to 200 basis points.  read more 
State banks also nearly doubled credit growth last year to ease fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic - a move that began driving up prices and forced the central bank to start a tightening cycle that brought the policy rate as high as 19% in March.",0
350,"HAMBURG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory board executive committee will meet on Tuesday evening to discuss the future of Chief Executive Herbert Diess, but further talks will likely be needed before a final decision is reached, three sources said.

351,"LONDON, Nov 23  (Reuters) - Fixed income managers have ramped up expectations for U.S. inflation and rate hikes in the face of stronger-than-anticipated price pressures, Russell Investments' quarterly survey of investors found.
Published on Tuesday, the survey of 53 leading bond and currency managers highlighted the challenges investors face in assessing the path ahead for long-dormant inflation.
The survey, conducted in October, found 55% of fund managers expected U.S. inflation at between 2.26% and 2.75% over the next 12 months, well above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target.
A full 20% expected inflation to move even higher.
In contrast, the previous survey in June showed about 70% of managers expected inflation over 12 months to exceed 2%.
Inflation is running at multi-decade highs in the United States, with recent data showing the consumer price index at 6.2% in the year to October, the biggest annual gain since 1990.
Reflecting investors' view that price pressures will stay elevated for a while, around 80% of those surveyed by Russell said they did not expect inflation to fall below 2% in the next five years.
Against this backdrop and in line with the recent repricing in money markets, fixed income managers also bought forward expectations for a first Fed rate increase.
While Russell's previous survey had shown that 80% of respondents expected no move before 2023, half of investors in the Q4 survey reckon the Fed will move in the second half of 2022.
Just over 40% of respondents expect 10-year Treasury yields to trade between 1.61% and 2% over the next 12 months, while 42% expected yields to rise above 2%.
Yields currently are around 1.63% .
""A key theme is that managers think inflation will be above the Fed's target,"" said Gerard Fitzpatrick, global head of fixed income at Russell Investments. ""But an important point is that managers are not looking at super high inflation"".
Expensive valuations and China's property sector were other concerns highlighted by bond investors, Fitzpatrick also said.
Fund managers' expectations for Europe were far more subdued -- 75% of respondents did not expect the European Central Bank to taper its asset purchases before 2023.
The ECB, which faces subdued inflation over the longer-term, has pushed back against market expectations for rate hikes as early as next year. Economists reckon it is unlikely to raise rates for several years.
That outlook has weighed on the euro, pushing it to 16-month lows around $1.1226 .
According to the Russell poll, 63% of respondents expected euro/dollar to trade over the next 12 months below the $1.16 level it trading at when the poll was conducted.
That is substantially lower than their prediction back in June, when around 80% of managers expected the euro to trade in a $1.21-$1.30 range.
On emerging market currencies, fund managers said the Russian rouble, Brazilian real and the Egyptian pound were likely to be the best performers in the next 12 months.",0
352,"SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov 23 (Reuters) - Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes denied lying to Walgreens about her company's technology during her fraud trial on Tuesday, offering rationales for withholding key details about operations and internal reports.
Holmes took the stand for a third day to defend herself against fraud accusations related to Theranos, a blood testing startup that is now defunct. The company had touted technology that could run diagnostic tests faster and more accurately than traditional lab testing with a drop of blood from a finger prick.
Jurors in San Jose, California, heard from a prosecutor at the start of the trial that Holmes falsely promised miniaturized blood analyzers to cement a partnership with Walgreens, but then secretly used ""the big, clunky third-party machines"" to test samples from patients who came into its stores.
On Tuesday, Holmes told jurors that she had been following legal advice when she withheld Theranos' use of third-party analyzers from Walgreens, as the modifications used to run small samples were Theranos' trade secret.
""The big medical device companies like Siemens could easily reproduce what we had done,"" she said.
Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles starting in 2015 that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate.
Holmes' decision to testify is risky as it exposes her to a potentially tough cross-examination by prosecutors.
Throughout her testimony, Holmes, 37, has sought to show that she believed Theranos' technology was capable of delivering on her claims, showing jurors encouraging emails from Theranos' scientists discussing the potential for a small machine to run any kind of test, and progress on developing it.
Holmes on Tuesday also denied misrepresenting Theranos' work with pharmaceutical companies Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Schering-Plough by adding the companies' logos, which prosecutors have called an attempt to pass off Theranos' conclusions as theirs.
She admitted that she added the logos to the reports just before sending them to pharmacy operator Walgreens (WBA.O), which was discussing a partnership with Theranos in 2010, to convey the drugmakers' involvement in promising studies using Theranos technology.
""I wish I had done it differently,"" Holmes said.
Holmes also testified that she did not conceal the addition from Pfizer, showing jurors an email where the report with the logo was sent to individuals at Pfizer in 2014.
Over the two-month trial, jurors have heard testimony from more than two dozen prosecution witnesses, including patients and investors whom prosecutors say Holmes deceived.
Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine wire fraud counts and two conspiracy counts.
Holmes is scheduled to resume testifying on Monday.",0

The release, will take the form of a loan and a sale,and was being in made concert with other releases from strategic reserves by China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, senior Biden administration officials said.

355,"WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and his wife Jill will travel to Nantucket, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, on Tuesday to spend Thanksgiving with their family, resuming a decades-long tradition that was interrupted last year due to the pandemic.
Biden has celebrated Thanksgiving on Nantucket nearly every year since 1975. The island, about 30 miles (48 km) south by ferry from Cape Cod, has long been a favored vacation spot of the wealthy, though more during the summer months than Thanksgiving.
Biden broke with family tradition in 2015, after the death of his son Beau from brain cancer and in 2020 after his election as president because of the pandemic when he followed public health guidance to avoid travel and large gatherings.
The President spoke about reuniting with family this Thanksgiving in remarks earlier this month while encouraging people to take their COVID-19 vaccines.
""Last Thanksgiving, for the first time, it was just four of us - my wife and I, our daughter and her - and my son-in-law.  Later this month, our tables and our hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines.""
On Monday, the president and the first lady helped serve Thanksgiving meals to U.S. troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, thanking them for their service and dedication to country.
Biden chose to visit U.S. forces within the United States rather than go abroad, unlike his predecessors, since he has withdrawn troops from Afghanistan and is set to end the U.S. combat mission in Iraq by year's end.
Former presidents including Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush all traveled to visit troops in either Iraq or Afghanistan during the holiday season.
Continuing a Thanksgiving tradition that dates back decades, last week Biden pardoned two giant white turkeys from Indiana - Peanut Butter and Jelly - in the White House Rose Garden.
Americans are gearing up to celebrate the annual holiday amid rising food and gas prices as the pandemic snarls global supply chains and the economic drag from the summer wave of COVID-19 infections fades.
The American Farm Bureau Federation said last week the annual Thanksgiving dinner will cost U.S. consumers an average of 14% more this year in the biggest annual increase in 31 years, though shoppers can still find deals in grocery stores.",0
356,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Over the last 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic forced an unprecedented global economic shutdown.
As the world is re-opening from a near economic standstill, countries across the globe are grappling with the challenges that arise as consumer demand for goods outpaces supply.
But here in the United States, the economic recovery is stronger and faster than anywhere else in the world – according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the U.S. is the only one of the major economies to have returned to pre-pandemic gross domestic product levels - in large part due to President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which funded and facilitated a nationwide vaccination program, provided resources to schools and small businesses to keep them open in the face of COVID waves and put money in the pockets of those hit hardest by the pandemic.
As a result of the strong recovery in the United States, Americans have nearly $100 more per month in disposable income in their pockets this year, even as COVID has continued to complicate the economic recovery around the world.
Even so, American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic. That’s why President Biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply.
Today, the President is announcing that the Department of Energy will make available releases of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower prices for Americans and address the mismatch between demand exiting the pandemic and supply.
The President has been working with countries across the world to address the lack of supply as the world exits the pandemic. And, as a result of President Biden’s leadership and our diplomatic efforts, this release will be taken in parallel with other major energy consuming nations including China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom. This culminates weeks of consultations with countries around the world, and we are already seeing the effect of this work on oil prices. Over the last several weeks as reports of this work became public, oil prices are down nearly 10 percent.
The U.S. Department of Energy will make available releases of 50 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in two ways:
The President stands ready to take additional action, if needed, and is prepared to use his full authorities working in coordination with the rest of the world to maintain adequate supply as we exit the pandemic.
Even as the President is helping to lead the world in addressing oil supply imbalances, he is also focused on how consolidation in the oil and gas sector may be resulting in anti-competitive practices that keep American consumers from benefitting when oil prices fall. There is mounting evidence that declines in oil prices are not translating into lower prices at the pump. Last week, the President asked the Federal Trade Commission to examine what is going on in oil and gas markets and to consider “whether illegal conduct is costing families at the pump.”
Today’s announcement reflects the President’s commitment to do everything in his power to bring down costs for the American people and continue our strong economic recovery. At the same time, the Administration remains committed to the President’s ambitious clean energy goals, as reflected in the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed last week and the House-passed Build Back Better Act that together represent the largest investment in combatting climate change in American history and is a critical step towards reaching a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and reducing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels.",0
357,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Newpark Resources (NR.N), a provider of drilling fluids systems and composite matting systems used in oilfields, is being pushed by an activist investor to separate its industrials systems and fluids business, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Bradley Radoff, a private investor who previously worked as a portfolio manager at Daniel Loeb's Third Point hedge fund, has approached Newpark's board and is pushing for the split. He argues that the two segments lack synergies, appeal to different investor bases and boost excessive corporate costs.
""The Company's own disclosures and investor presentations highlight that the Industrial Solutions segment is a high-margin business on a growth trajectory, while the Fluid Systems segment is an unprofitable business operating at the opposite end of the energy transition spectrum,"" Radoff wrote to the board.
""Newpark's board and management team are highly focused on creating shareholder value as we execute on our strategic priorities, particularly the expansion and diversification of our Industrial Solutions business,"" a spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that the company already said that it hired JPMorgan Chase to  review its portfolio and evaluate alternatives. The company also said it values shareholder input and hopes ""to have continued constructive dialogue with (Bradley Radoff).”
Newpark undermines its ability to have ""a credible environmental, social and governance story"" by keeping the two segments together, Radoff wrote. A majority of Newpark's board members are oil and gas industry veterans.
The company's stock price closed at $2.72 on Monday. Five years ago, the stock was trading at $7.80.
Radoff, who sits on independent energy company VAALCO Energy's (EGY.N) board and has successfully pushed for changes at Tetra Technologies, where the company agreed to add a diverse director and appoint a new chairman, is urging Newpark to split at a time a number of other companies are breaking apart.",0

359,"ABUJA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria's government on Tuesday rejected a judicial report that described the killing of peaceful protesters in Lagos in October 2020 as a massacre, saying it was strewn with errors and its conclusions were not backed up by evidence.
The leaked report into the incident seen by Reuters said the Nigerian Army fired live rounds at peaceful, unarmed protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos last year. It said most of the  army officers deployed to the Toll Gate were ""not fit and proper to serve"" and recommended prosecuting certain policemen for their actions.
The military and police have previously denied firing live rounds.
Information Minister Lai Mohammed told reporters in Abuja that the panel had submitted a report laden with allegations, adding the report ""is riddled by many errors, discrepancies. Its conclusion is not supported by evidence.""
The report identified 48 ""casualties"", including 11 killed, four missing and presumed dead and multiple people who suffered gunshot wounds. It added that nearly 100 other unidentified corpses in Lagos state could also be linked to the incident.
The judicial panel that investigated the incident, as well as abuses by the now-abolished Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police division, released the report to the Lagos state government this month, but it was not immediately made public.
President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the federal government will wait for pronouncements from state governments which set up the probe panels before deciding what action to take.
The shootings ended weeks of nationwide protests against police brutality and sparked the worst civil unrest in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule in 1999.
In the aftermath, rights groups accused security forces of a cover-up and depicted a pattern of intimidation of those who took part in the protests, including threats, detentions and asset freezes. ",0
360,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) has once again been named the world's most important bank to the health of the wider financial system, according to the latest annual ranking of top lenders by global regulators.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), made up of regulators from G20 countries, published its latest table of the world's 30 most systemic banks on Tuesday.
The 30 lenders are divided between four ""buckets"" in order of how systemic, international, interconnected and complex they are, with JPMorgan now in a higher bucket than its nearest peers.
Last year the bank, which had also been the world's most systemic lender in 2019, shared the highest bucket with HSBC and Citigroup, but is now alone in the next bucket up, which had been empty.
BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) were also declared more systemic, both moving up one bucket.
Being included in the table means having to hold additional capital and undergo more intense supervision to avoid a repeat of taxpayer bailouts in the banking crisis over a decade ago. In practice, the lenders typically hold capital buffers that are already above FSB requirements.
JPMorgan had a core equity ratio of 12.9% of capital to risk-weighted assets at the end of September, well above the minimum 11.3% set out by the Federal Reserve, according to a filing from the bank.
The FSB's capital surcharge for JPMorgan is now 2.5%, up from 2% last year.
U.S. banks have been aggressively, if unsuccessfully, fighting the FSB capital surcharges, but they are unlikely to make much headway under the administration of President Joe Biden.
However the FSB raised the prospect of relief for euro zone banks on how their exposures to other countries in the bloc are taken into account.
Euro zone lenders argue they are all regulated by the European Central Bank under the EU's banking union, and therefore their exposures to other euro zone countries should not be viewed as 'cross-border', attracting tougher treatment.
The FSB said on Tuesday that the Basel Committee, which writes global bank capital rules, will conduct a near-term review of cross-border exposures within the banking union in relation to its list of most systemic lenders.",0

362,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) will start selling most products for $1.25 at all its eponymous stores, in an effort to offset the impact of spiraling freight costs and other pandemic-driven challenges.
The retailer said on Tuesday the new price point, which will be fully rolled out by the first quarter of 2022, would allow it to return to ""its historical gross margin range"" of 35% to 36% next year.
Chief Executive Officer Michael Witynski said the higher price point allows the discounter to expand assortments, introduce new products and sizes as well as bring back ""traffic-driving"" products.
Dollar Tree, known for selling everything from make-up to homeware at the $1 price-point, in September said it planned on adding new price points above $1 across some of its stores.
The price increase is a good thing, as the 3Q results, and our first-quarter outlook indicate freight headwinds are worse than anticipated, Evercore analyst Michael Montani said.
Rising freight costs from global supply chain disruptions have dented profits for most of Corporate America, further pressuring many retailers already grappling with higher labor and raw material costs.
Dollar Tree said that freight costs were significantly higher than anticipated in the third quarter and expects this to continue in the near term.
It projected fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.79. Analysts on average were anticipating $1.75, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Shoppers have been splurging on streetwear, visiting stores more after vaccinations and the easing of COVID-19 curbs. But congested ports and factory closures in Asia have resulted in nearly empty shelves for some retailers.
Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N) on Tuesday also posted quarterly revenue above market expectations but said its inventory levels were largely flat from a year earlier.
Shares in Abercrombie fell about 17%, tracking their worst day in 2-1/2 years, while those of American Eagle rose 5%.
Abercrombie is expected to take a hit of around $75 million in the fourth quarter due to higher freight rates, Chief Finance Officer Scott Lipesky said on a post-earnings call.
American Eagle forecast additional holiday-quarter freight costs of $70 million to $80 million. The company, however, has been beefing up its logistics game, after it agreed this month to buy Quiet Logistics for $350 million, following its takeover of AirTerra earlier this year.
Most other U.S. apparel sellers have reported an increase in inventory levels as they chartered their own container ships and ordered products in advance for the holidays.
American Eagle said its inventory at the end of the third quarter increased 32% to $740 million. ""We are in a healthy inventory position ... set up for a very strong holiday,"" Chief Operating Officer Michael Rempell told analysts.

The outlook reflects recent changes in the betting industry landscape, conservative projections of recovery in cross-border operations, and the sale of a stake in digital services provider Tochka, the company said in a statement.
In the third quarter Qiwi completed the sale of its 40% stake in Tochka to Bank Otkritie, gaining 6.2 billion roubles.

BUND YIELDS TO FALL AGAIN IN 2022? (1224 GMT)
Terminal rates have been pretty much in fashion recently as they can explain current low levels in nominal and real yields.
HSBC Global Research analysts incorporated a range of terminal rate estimates in their forecasts, and say they expect 10-year Bund yields to ""fall instead of rising in 2022"" despite a monetary tightening from the European Central Bank.
They argue that ""the five-year maturity has the greatest sensitivity to the start date of an ECB hiking cycle from our scenario analysis; tenors longer than 10 years are increasingly sensitive to the terminal rate.""
""Unless we assume a higher terminal rate than anything inferred by the market in 2021, we don't think fair value for (10-year) Bund yields should get above zero,"" they say.
""Our current end-2021 forecast of -30bp (Germany’s 10-year yield) reflects a blend of early and cautious hiking scenarios,"" that the market will be slow to give up on, they add.
Our end-2022 forecast of -50bp is a blend of our ""cautious hiking"" and ""no-hike"" scenarios.
Economists estimate the terminal or natural interest rate, which is the rate that is consistent with full employment, capacity utilization and stable prices.
The chart shows Germany’s 10-year government bond yield  staying below zero level since May 2019.

FOURTH COVID WAVE RISKS : ""SIZEABLE BUT MANAGEABLE""
(1131 GMT)
Investors shouldn't fret too much about the possible negative impact on economic growth stemming from this fourth wave of COVID-19 infections across Europe.
Goldman Sachs has run a analysis to conclude risks are ""sizeable but manageable"" under their baseline scenario.
The U.S. bank estimates a potential hit to Euro area GDP growth of 0.2 pct points in both Q4 and Q1 relative to their current forecast, and about half as much in the UK.
""A sizeable but significantly smaller drag than last winter,"" they note, adding that in each scenario activity is set to rebound in Q2 and Q3 as countries unwind restrictions.
""We expect additional targeted restrictions in the big-four Euro area countries and (to a lesser extent) the UK, but do not look for a return to blanket national lockdowns..."" it says.
""Europe has significantly higher Covid immunity than last winter, which should help protect hospital capacity, especially in the South,"" it adds .
GS downside scenario entails a repeat of last winter's lockdowns, meaning 1.4% cumulative decline in Euro area GDP.

YEAR-END TARGETS ACHIEVED: NOW WHAT? (1007 GMT)
The bull run that has pushed many European benchmarks to breach above analyst targets show clear signs of fatigue, and now that COVID-19 and rate concerns are taking the top spot in the market narrative, many wonder if there's any upside left.
For Christian Stocker, strategist at UniCredit in Munich,  equities have already run their full course this year, but over the next 12 months, he's upbeat.
""European equity markets have reached or even slightly surpassed our year-end index targets for this year. Although we expect no new impulses in the short term, the environment remains constructive,"" he says.
""We expect potential of up to 10% for European equities until year-end 2022, albeit the path towards higher prices might not be smooth,"" he adds. This means the Euro STOXX 50 could reach levels around 4750 and the DAX climb to 18000 points.

Jerome Powell's second inning as Federal Reserve chair has brought out the U.S. dollar bulls in force. Money markets have advanced their expectations of a full quarter percentage point rate hike by June next year from September 2022, only a few weeks earlier.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields  are less than 10 bps away from 2021 highs while the U.S. dollar has barrelled past some important market levels against its rivals. What can spoil the party?

The readings may also reinforce the gap between robust U.S.  activity and COVID-plagued Europe, potentially further depressing the euro, which plumbed new 16-month lows on Monday .
Monday's euro area consumer confidence indicator offered a warning, falling back below pre-pandemic levels. October PMIs showed bloc's activity slowing the weakest in six months, while businesses' costs rose at the fastest pace in two decades. U.S. and British PMIs fared better but eye-popping price increases still featured.
A price slowdown would vindicate central bankers' who have until now rejected surging inflation as transitory. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell (re-appointed for another four years) spoke on Monday the corrosive impact of inflation.

369,"NEW DELHI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - India will release 5 million barrels of oil from its strategic reserves in coordination with other buyers including the United States, China, Japan and South Korea, a government statement said on Tuesday.
The move is part of efforts led by U.S. President Joe Biden's for a coordinated release of stockpiles, seen as a warning to the OPEC+ to pump more oil to tackle rising inflation in major economies like the United States, China and others.
The release of 5 million barrels will happen in parallel and in consultation with other major global energy consumers including the United States, China, Japan and Korea, the government said, without specifying the timeframe for the release.
India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, has been raising concerns over rising oil prices and wants OPEC and its allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+ to quicken the pace of increasing output.
""India has repeatedly expressed concern at supply of oil being artificially adjusted below demand levels by oil producing countries, leading to rising prices and negative attendant consequences,"" the government statement said.",0
370,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada's commodity-heavy main stock index were subdued on Tuesday, as the positive sentiment in financials owed to prospects of higher interest rate next year was countered by a more than 1% slump in crude prices, while bullion hovered near a two-week low.

371,"BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Joachim Sauer, Chancellor Angela Merkel's academic husband, has blamed his compatriots' ""laziness and complacency"" for Germany's comparatively low vaccination rate, saying public rejection of science has never been as visible as now.
Sauer, who until his retirement in 2017 was professor of quantum chemistry at Berlin's Humboldt University and seen as one of the field's top researchers, has been reticent to discuss politics throughout his wife's 16-year tenure.
He has been reluctant to play the role of political spouse, declining to accompany her on most trips and largely limiting his public commentary to his own scientific research and his passion for the composer Richard Wagner.
But in Italy this week to be inducted into the Italian Academy of Sciences in Turin, he briefly addressed the issue that has dominated his wife's final two years in office.
""It's astonishing that a third of the population is not following scientific evidence,"" he told La Repubblica, as reported by its German partner newspaper Die Welt on Tuesday.
""Partly that's down to a certain German laziness and complacency. The other group is people ... who are reacting ideologically to what they think of as a vaccine dictatorship.""
The fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic is the severest yet in Germany, with hospitals overflowing with the unvaccinated and initial vaccinations wearing off.  read more 
Some 68% of Germans have been fully vaccinated, lagging the proportions in Britain and France, let alone global leaders such as Portugal and Singapore.
Many health policy experts blame misinformation about the supposed danger posed by vaccines for the gap. For Sauer, the gap underscores the importance of attracting more young people to scientific careers.
""Science is important, and it would be good if more young people devoted themselves to it,"" he said.",0
372,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Big Ben's dials will emerge from a shroud of scaffolding in time for the world famous clock to perform its most important annual role - ringing in the New Year for thousands on the streets of London and millions more watching on television.
The clock tower of Britain's Houses of Parliament has been hidden for three-and-a-half years while hundreds of craftspeople repaired masonry, replaced metalwork and repainted and regilded in the biggest restoration since it was built in 1859.
Nick Sturge, project manager for Sir Robert McAlpine's special projects, said removing the scaffolding was a ""massive milestone"" in the 79.7 million pound ($107 million) project.
""By New Year people will start to see a big difference; they'll start to get their tower back,"" he said. ""The roofs will be fully visible along with the four clock faces.""
Big Ben, the largest and most accurate four-faced chiming clock when it was built, is a symbol of London and Britain's parliamentary democracy around the world, as well as being one of the most photographed sites in the city.
The restoration includes replacing all of the panels on the clock faces using and-blown glass, Sturge said. The dials' hands, numerals and other details have been repainted bright blue rather than the black long familiar to Londoners.
BLUE COLOUR SCHEME
Sturge said an early watercolour showed a blue colour scheme, which was confirmed by paint analysis that discovered the first coat was Prussian blue.
""It's really striking,"" he said. ""When you stand on the street it's a really nice nod to the past.""
The floral emblems of the four parts of the United Kingdom - the thistle, shamrock, leek and rose - have been repainted in the colours of Charles Barry's original design for the tower, which was renamed after Queen Elizabeth in 2012.
The 12 bongs from the Great Bell - the origin of the name Big Ben - that will mark the turning of the year will be powered by an electric motor. The original Victorian clock mechanism will take over again when the bells resume their familiar pattern of chiming every quarter and striking every hour in the spring.
Alex Jeffrey, one of three clockmakers at the Palace of Westminster, the parliament building's official name, said the clock had been transported to Cumbria, in northwestern England, to be disassembled and rebuilt.
""Everything has been restored to its original spec,"" he said. ""It's a lot of kit - 11-and-a-half tonnes. To give you an example, one of the hands weighs about 305 kilogrammes (672 lbs) and the minute hand is 14 feet long (4.3 metres).""
The one dial showing the time when the scaffolding comes down is electric-driven, but all four dials will be run by the original gravity powered clock again in the spring.
""It is famously accurate,"" he said. ""The Great Clock is designed extremely well and it's accurate to one second to the first strike of each hour.""

373,"DUBAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Egypt is expected to finalise a $3 billion loan to be used in part to finance sustainable projects, three sources said, as the nation attempts to recover from a drop in tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The financing, arranged by Emirates NBD (ENBD.DU) and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB.AD), follows the repayment earlier this year of a $2 billion facility Egypt borrowed last year, one of the sources said.
Part of the loan will be ""green"", meaning proceeds will be used to finance sustainable projects, and part will be Sharia-compliant, the sources said, asking not to be named because the deal has not been made public.
A group of conventional and Islamic banks are taking part in the syndication process, they said.
Egyptian officials were not immediately available to comment on the new loan. Emirates NBD and FAB declined to comment.
The new transaction was initially marketed to banks with a $2 billion size but was increased because it was over-subscribed, two of the sources said.
It will need parliamentary approval to be finalised, one of the sources said.
In August last year Egypt raised a $2 billion loan arranged by Emirates NBD and FAB to finance the state budget and support the economy. 
That facility, split into conventional and Islamic tranches, had a one-year duration, while the new loan will have a three-year tenor, two of the sources said.
Fitch Ratings last month affirmed the country's long-term foreign currency rating at B+ with a stable outlook, saying it had shown stability and resilience during the pandemic, but had a budget deficit of around 7.5% of gross domestic product.
The loss of tourism during the pandemic reduced one of Egypt's major sources of foreign currency.

376,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) on Tuesday projected quarterly sales below market estimates, a sign that shortages of electronic products would hamper its business during the crucial holiday season.
The forecast sent the retailer's shares tumbling 14% and reflected the toll of shipping logjams, shuttered factories and a scarcity of raw materials that have ripped through global supply chains this year.
Best Buy is facing supply constraints in categories such as appliances, mobile phones and gaming, Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said on a post-earnings call.
Sony Corp (6758.T) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have struggled to keep the latest versions of their gaming consoles in stock since their launch a year ago due to a widespread chip crunch, while some analysts have warned Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) latest iPhones could be in short supply during the holiday season.  read more 
Those devices are important for Best Buy as they sell in large numbers and act as a magnet for customers who often spend on other products.
""Getting hold of Apple's latest iPhone or its new laptops is very challenging. These items should, in theory, be providing a nice lift to sales as the holidays approach, but stock levels remain low,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of research provider GlobalData.
The company had included easier access to ""hardest-to-find"" products as a perk in a $200-a-year membership program launched last month to navigate the shortage.
But costs related to the program, increased expenditure to expedite some shipments and earlier Black Friday deals were expected to take a toll on its margins in the fourth quarter.
Best Buy forecast current-quarter comparable sales between a fall of 2% and a rise of 1%, the midpoint of which was below estimates of a 0.1% rise, according to Refinitiv data.
Its shares fell the most in intraday trading since the pandemic-driven selloff in March 2020.",0

378,"BRUSSELS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - European Union governments kicked off a debate on Tuesday about how long vaccines are effective against COVID-19 and whether evidence of a booster dose will be required to maintain free travel across the bloc as cases spike.
The executive European Commission is due to present a proposal this week to coordinate free movement using COVID-19 passes, after Austria became the first country in western Europe on Monday to reimpose a lockdown since vaccines were rolled out.
EU coordination on the passes, showing if a holder is fully vaccinated or has a recent negative test or recovery from infection, has allowed an easing of curbs on cross-border travel.
The passes, typically viewed on mobile devices, are issued by individual countries, but are recognised for travel across the bloc. They are now increasingly being deployed in many EU countries for access to indoor areas such as bars or theatres.
Greece has proposed that people should in future only be able to travel freely if they have received a second or third dose in the previous six months and that booster doses should be added to the information shown in EU passes.
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said it was vital the 27 EU states agree a common standard. His country would normally receive about 200,000 workers a day from neighbouring countries.
""We can't have different systems in Luxembourg and in Greece, or in Germany or France. It would be against the interests of the European citizens. They demand that of us and it can be done,"" he told reporters before a meeting of EU counterparts in Brussels.
Irish EU affairs minister Thomas Byrne echoed the view that the EU digital COVID passes, launched in July, needed to continue to facilitate free movement.
German European Affairs Minister Michael Roth said booster doses were now ""the order of the day"", pointing to scientific studies that show they really bolster immunity. He added: ""A digital vaccination certificate is of paramount importance, but it must be based on scientific knowledge.""",0

380,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A SpaceX rocket was set to blast off from California late Tuesday as NASA seeks to demonstrate a first-of-its-kind planetary defense system, designed to deflect an asteroid from a potential doomsday collision with Earth.
The DART mission will test NASA's ability to alter an asteroid's trajectory with kinetic force - crashing a robot spacecraft into it at high speed and nudging the space boulder just enough to keep our planet out of harm's way.
DART's target is a tiny fraction of the size of the cataclysmic Chicxulub asteroid that slammed into Earth about 66 million years ago, killing most of the planet's animal species. It is not on a path that will cause it to hit Earth in the foreseeable future.
But scientists say smaller asteroids are far more common and pose a far greater theoretical threat to Earth in the near term.
NASA has hired Elon Musk's company SpaceX to launch DART aboard a Falcon 9 rocket at 10:20 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday (1:20 a.m. Eastern/0620 GMT Wednesday) from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast, about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
If liftoff is postponed NASA has an 84-day launch window in which to try again.
Once released into space, DART will journey 10 months to its destination, some 6.8 million miles (11 million km) from Earth.
Its target is an asteroid ""moonlet"" the size of a football stadium that orbits a much larger chunk of rock - about five times bigger - in a binary asteroid system named Didymos, the Greek word for twin.
The moonlet, called Dimorphos, is one of the smallest astronomical objects to receive a permanent name. But at 525 feet (160 km) in diameter, its size is typical among the known asteroids - rubble-like remnants left over from formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.
SIMPLER THAN 'ARMAGEDDON'
Scientists chose the Didymos system because its relative proximity to Earth and dual-asteroid configuration make it ideal to observe the results of the impact.
The key to avoiding a killer asteroid is to detect it well in advance and be ready with the means of changing its course, NASA planetary defense officer Lindley Johnson told a media briefing this month.
""We don't want to be in a situation where an asteroid is headed toward Earth and then have to be testing this kind of capability,"" he said.
The team behind DART, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, has determined that slamming a car-sized projectile into a Dimorphos-sized asteroid at 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph) should do the trick.
The DART spacecraft, a cube-shaped box with two rectangular solar arrays, is due to rendezvous with the Didymos-Dimorphos pair in late September 2022.
Cameras mounted on the impactor and on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft released from DART about 10 days beforehand will record the collision.
Observations from ground-based telescopes and radar will then measure how much the moonlet's orbit around Didymos changes.
The DART team is expecting to shorten the orbital track by about 10 minutes but would consider at least 73 seconds a success.
The entire cost of the DART project will run about $330 million, according to Lindley, well below that of many of NASA's most ambitious science missions.",0
381,"COPENHAGEN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Danish grid operator Energinet signed deals on Tuesday with Belgium's Elia (ELI.BR) and Germany's 50Hertz that move Denmark closer to building two sea links connecting its offshore wind turbines to Germany and Belgium to boost the flow of green energy in the region.
A massive expansion of offshore grid infrastructure is needed to meet the rising amount of renewable energy needed to enable European countries to slash dependency on fossil fuels while ensuring that volatile renewables become a more reliable source of energy.
Energinet said a cooperation agreement signed with  transmission system operator Elia edged them closer to a final investment decision on an interconnector between their two countries via a yet-to-be-built artificial island in the North Sea.
With a relatively small coastline and limited access to offshore wind power in the Belgian part of the North Sea, Belgium needs to import green energy on a large scale.
Energinet also inked a separate deal with German high-voltage grid firm 50Hertz, of which Elia owns 80%, on a power link to another planned hub which will be located on the Danish Baltic island of Bornholm.
Denmark is planning to more than triple its offshore wind capacity by building two so-called energy islands - hubs for large volumes of power - linked to new wind farms in the Baltic and North seas to help meet ambitious climate change targets.
With the new agreement, the three system operators will now be able to start feasibility studies and prepare business cases for the projects which would still require final investment decisions and national approvals to be realised.",0
382,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Drax (DRX.L) is considering building a biomass plant in the United States whose power generation it says will absorb more emissions than it creates, its CEO told the Reuters Events Energy Transition Europe Summit on Tuesday.
Drax is developing technology to capture and store emissions generated from burning wood-based biomass pellets, which are categorized as renewable power, and hopes to have this up and running at a plant in Britain by 2027.
The company said that as well as the plant capturing the emissions it creates by burning pellets, the absorption of greenhouse gases during the growth of the wood means its overall impact will be carbon negative.
Green groups vocal at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow this month have criticized the burning of wood biomass pellets, arguing it is not a carbon-neutral method of energy generation and that pellet production can contribute to deforestation.
""It's very early stages, but we might go ahead and build another project in the U.S.,” Chief Executive Will Gardiner said. ""Already we see there are corporates who are interested in buying negative emissions.""
Many companies have set net zero emissions targets which will require them to purchase carbon offset credits to compensate for the emissions they are unable to cut themselves.
Some corporate giants such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) have also said they are willing to pay a premium for removal offsets, which take carbon emissions out of the atmosphere.
Drax's power stations provide around 6% of Britain’s electricity, and the company has converted most of its coal-fired power plants to biomass over the past few years.
Gardiner said Drax only uses wood residuals or byproducts from trees primarily used for lumber, and that demand for wood from sustainable managed forests can help increase forest growth.",0
383,"PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - French fishermen are planning actions, including possibly blocking British vessels' access to French ports, in protest against Britain's refusal to grant them more licences to operate in UK territorial waters, fishermen said on Tuesday.
France and Britain have been at loggerheads for months over how many licences French fishermen should get as part of a post-Brexit deal, with France accusing Britain of not handing out enough permits and Britain saying it is respecting the deal.
But with talks dragging on, fishermen have decided to take action, said Olivier Lepretre, president of the organisation that represents fishermen's interests in northern France.
""Action is imminent,"" Lepretre said.
He did not give details.
But Stephane Fournier, one of the dozens of fishermen awaiting a licence, told Reuters that fishermen across the region had been informed that the action would take place from Friday.
""All trans-Channel traffic (and) all freight in all the ports of France will be blocked,"" Fournier said.
Lepretre said only that details were yet to be confirmed but the action would affect trade.
""Britain wants to get access to the European market? They should give us the licences. If not, we will cut their access,"" he said.
It was not intended to harm British fishermen, ""who are simple fishers like us,"" he said.
French fishermen have previously taken matters into their own hands, including, in April, blocking trucks carrying fish from British waters to processing centers in France.
In May, the British Royal Navy sent two patrol boats when French boats blockaded the Saint Helier harbour in Jersey.
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters on Tuesday the UK's position has not changed.
""We will provide additional licences when the requisite evidence is supplied, we're not negotiating over changing that approach,"" the spokesperson said.
Last week, France's maritime minister Annick Girardin drew the ire of fishermen after she proposed compensation of 60 million euros ($68 million) for fishermen who will not receive a licence, a move interpreted as an admission of defeat.
President Emmanuel Macron has since said France ""will not yield"".

FOURTH COVID WAVE RISKS : ""SIZEABLE BUT MANAGEABLE""
(1131 GMT)
Investors shouldn't fret too much about the possible negative impact on economic growth stemming from this fourth wave of COVID-19 infections across Europe.
Goldman Sachs has run a analysis to conclude risks are ""sizeable but manageable"" under their baseline scenario.
The U.S. bank estimates a potential hit to Euro area GDP growth of 0.2 pct points in both Q4 and Q1 relative to their current forecast, and about half as much in the UK.
""A sizeable but significantly smaller drag than last winter,"" they note, adding that in each scenario activity is set to rebound in Q2 and Q3 as countries unwind restrictions.
""We expect additional targeted restrictions in the big-four Euro area countries and (to a lesser extent) the UK, but do not look for a return to blanket national lockdowns..."" it says.
""Europe has significantly higher Covid immunity than last winter, which should help protect hospital capacity, especially in the South,"" it adds .
GS downside scenario entails a repeat of last winter's lockdowns, meaning 1.4% cumulative decline in Euro area GDP.

YEAR-END TARGETS ACHIEVED: NOW WHAT? (1007 GMT)
The bull run that has pushed many European benchmarks to breach above analyst targets show clear signs of fatigue, and now that COVID-19 and rate concerns are taking the top spot in the market narrative, many wonder if there's any upside left.
For Christian Stocker, strategist at UniCredit in Munich,  equities have already run their full course this year, but over the next 12 months, he's upbeat.
""European equity markets have reached or even slightly surpassed our year-end index targets for this year. Although we expect no new impulses in the short term, the environment remains constructive,"" he says.
""We expect potential of up to 10% for European equities until year-end 2022, albeit the path towards higher prices might not be smooth,"" he adds. This means the Euro STOXX 50 could reach levels around 4750 and the DAX climb to 18000 points.

385,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - So much for hopes that hydrogen could come to Thyssenkrupp’s (TKAG.DE) rescue. Swedish activist Cevian on Tuesday sold nearly half its 15% stake in the ailing German conglomerate  read more  after a share price rally triggered by excitement around production of the gas. Although hydrogen will play a central role in the carbon-free economy, sector valuations in the hundreds of times sales look suspiciously bubbly.
Cevian’s reluctance to find out is compounded by the losses it’s swallowing. It bought in in 2013 and 2014 when Thyssenkrupp shares were trading around 18 euros. Assuming it sold close to Tuesday’s market price, it’s accepting a 7.50 euro loss per share, or around 320 million euros in total. Without last week’s 23% rally, the pain would have been greater still. Cevian retains a 7.9% holding in the 7 billion euro steel-to-submarines group, which will be handy if its hydrogen plans do come off. But as votes of confidence go, it’s not great. (By Ed Cropley)

387,"ISTANBUL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A Turkish court resumed a trial over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Tuesday, as a journalism watchdog described the case as ""nearing deadlock"" and said the hearing needed to include Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role.
Khashoggi, a critic of Prince Mohammed, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. Turkish officials believe his body was dismembered and removed. His remains have not been found.
A U.S. intelligence report released in March said Prince Mohammed had approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi in Oct. 2018. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by the crown prince and rejected the report's findings.
While Washington imposed sanctions on some of those involved, it spared the crown prince himself.
Two requests by lawyers for Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's Turkish fiancee, to have the U.S. report added to the case in Turkey have been rejected by the court in previous sessions.
The Turkish court is trying 26 Saudis in absentia on various charges related to Khashoggi's murder. On Tuesday the court requested the Justice Ministry send a letter to Saudi Arabia, asking about those who were sentenced in a trial held in the Kingdom, so that they do not receive a punishment twice.
In September 2020, a Saudi court jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years over the killing in a trial critics said lacked transparency. None of the defendants was named.
Erol Onderoglu, representative for Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said justice could not be served as a result of the trial if it did not include Prince Mohammed.
""Everyone knows that the judicial process will be symbolic as long as the defendants are not caught and returned to Turkey,"" he said, describing the case as ""nearing deadlock.""
Tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing have led to an informal Saudi boycott of Turkish goods. But Ankara has softened its rhetoric and criticism of Riyadh and the two countries have been working to normalise ties after a series of phone calls between President Tayyip Erdogan and King Salman.
The improvement in relation comes as Turkey has been working to mend ties with other countries in the region, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
""The signs towards Turkey-Saudi relations getting closer are of course raising concern that the case could be moved into the shadows, could be pushed into the background,"" RSF's Onderoglu said.
The concerns had been raised by the Istanbul prosecutor's office not requesting the CIA report and the court not adding it to the case, he said.
The next hearing will be held on Feb. 24.",0

390,"BRUNSWICK, Georgia, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Henry Johnson, 60, can often be found weightlifting in the garage of his home near Brunswick, Georgia. When people walk by his house and ask, ""Did you see today? Do you know what happened?"" he knows immediately what they are talking about.
At church services, at neighborhood cookouts and on morning walks, conversation is dominated by one topic: the murder trial of three white men who saw a Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, running through their neighborhood in February 2020, chased him in their trucks and shot him dead after a brief struggle.
In the mostly white community of Satilla Shores on the outskirts of Brunswick where the three men lived and Arbery was shot, many people support their neighbors going free, arguing that the shooting was tragic but not criminal.
Arbery was shot three times after grappling with one of the defendants for his shotgun. The defendants have pleaded not guilty and said the shooting was self defense.
In the mostly Black neighborhood of Boykin Ridge that Arbery called home, Johnson, a former neighbor, said most of the people he speaks to keep their opinions about the men to themselves. But in interviews other residents were more blunt: The three defendants should go to jail, they said.
The Boykin Ridge neighborhood is on edge ahead of the verdict, which could come this week. Residents know the world is closely watching the case and judging the outcome.
""People are nervous,"" said Johnson, an aviation technician who was benchpressing close to 300 pounds (136 kg) on Monday. Arbery would often support him when he was lifting heavier weights, he said.
""He was a good kid,"" Johnson said. ""We jokingly called him the 'running man' because was always running by, doing sprints.""
Prosecutors say Arbery, 25, was on a Sunday afternoon jog when Gregory McMichael, 65 and his son Travis McMichael, 35, saw him pass their driveway and assumed the worst - that he was a criminal. Their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, joined them in chasing Arbery in an attempt to carry out a citizen's arrest.
Deborah Ray, 72, a retired florist who lives in a cul-de-sac on Boykin Ridge Road, said Arbery would start his sprint training in the street next to her driveway.
""It's a shame about what happened to that young man,"" she told Reuters. ""He'd call me Ms. Ray and wave as he went by. He loved everybody.
""Of course we all talk about it,"" Ray, who is white, said of the trial. ""When I'm on my walks I stop and chat and what-not with everyone. It's friendly here. Everyone wants to know what you think will happen. I can't judge anyone, but it was a terrible thing,"" she said.
Camisha Bowers, 24, a close friend of Arbery's who grew up down the street from him on Boykin Ridge Drive, said the whole neighborhood is anxious about the verdict, which will be rendered by a jury of 11 white people and one Black person.
""All the attention of the world is on this. I just hope they do the right thing, you know,"" she said, adding that she wanted justice for her friend.
'NO TRESPASSING'
In the Satilla Shores neighborhood, there is a sense of a community under siege. ""No trespassing"" signs have proliferated on trees and doors in recent weeks. ""Go home,"" a number of residents said when approached for interviews. People said they were exhausted by the media attention.
""The jury should send them home,"" one resident said of the three defendants before telling a Reuters reporter to leave.
Jay Wells, 61, who lives just around the corner from the shooting, said like most of his neighbors he feels bad about what happened but doesn't believe ""three men should have their lives ruined.""
""It's a tragedy any which way you look at it,"" Wells said. ""I know a man is dead, but there are three men who might be locked up forever. And I can't say that is right for the way this happened.""
Audra Favre, 53, a mortgage underwriter who moved to Satilla Shores just after the shooting, said that at neighborhood cookouts or when people are talking around their shared boat docks, the trial is ""the topic.""
At the gatherings, she said almost everyone is in favor of not guilty verdicts for all of the men. ""That's not how I feel. I think they took the law into their own hands,"" she said.
But she added, ""You have to understand, so many people around here know them, are friends with them.""",0
391,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Travis McMichael, a defendant in the Ahmaud Arbery murder trial, says he followed firearms training when he fatally shot the 25-year-old Black man. Many U.S. gun instructors disagree.
McMichael testified last week that he drew on his U.S. Coast Guard training by levelling a shotgun at Arbery to make him ""back off."" But gun professionals interviewed by Reuters said he broke a basic tenet: Never point a gun at anyone, let alone shoot them, unless you are in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death.
""There's just not enough evidence that these guys had to use deadly force,"" said Rodney Smith, CEO and director of training at the Georgia Firearms and Security Training Academy.
McMichael also testified that Arbery never threatened him verbally or brandished a weapon.
McMichael, 35, his father Gregory McMichael, 65, a former police officer and investigator with the local district attorney's office, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges that include murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment.
They said they did nothing wrong in jumping into their pickup trucks to chase Arbery, whom they suspected of burglary, as he jogged through their mostly white neighborhood in Georgia. The younger McMichael was the only defendant to take the stand. He testified he fired his pump-action shotgun at close range at Arbery in self defense, saying Arbery had grabbed his gun.
Both the Arbery case, in which the jury was set to begin deliberations on Tuesday, and the Wisconsin murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse that ended Friday with an acquittal, have revolved around armed white men claiming self defense before nearly all-white juries.
Reuters interviewed around a dozen firearm instructors, gun shop owners and arms makers. Some saw parallels between the two.
Michael Cargill said Arbery should be seen as Rittenhouse was - a man in fear of his life.  read more 
""Those cases are the same,"" said Cargill, 52, owner of the Central Texas Gun Works firing range and gun shop in Austin, Texas. ""Kyle Rittenhouse was trying to get away from people that were trying to kill him. And he had a rifle and he used it to defend himself. Ahmaud Arbery was trying to get away from people who were trying to kill him. He didn't have a gun. He was shot and killed.""
In a trial that divided America, Rittenhouse was charged with murdering two men and wounding another during racial justice protests in the Wisconsin city of Kenosha last year. Rittenhouse testified he had gone to Kenosha to help protect property during the protests. Supporters called him a hero for shootings they saw as justified while opponents said he provoked violence by aiming a rifle at people.
Clifford Wallace, 36, said both cases showed the need for verbal warnings before pointing and discharging firearms.
""I can't just shoot you because you appear to be a threat, right? It has to be imminent. I have to know that you're a threat,"" said Wallace, owner of firearms training, retail and manufacturing company Democratic Arms in Berrien Springs, Michigan.
Louis Evans, 75, a former Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy and owner of Evans Security Training & Range in Compton, California, took issue with the defense argument that gun safety protocols were followed in the shooting of Arbery.
""Everything they did was messed up. People who are not following the rule of law; they violated everything,"" Evans said of the McMichaels and Bryan.
Cargill said if Americans supported Rittenhouse, they should support the case against Arbery's killers.
""Both cases are the same, and if you're not looking at it in the same way, then you're racist,"" Cargill said.",0

393,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Kellogg Co (K.N) said on Tuesday it plans to hire permanent replacements for some of its U.S. breakfast cereal plant workers who are on strike, after lengthy negotiations with the union again fell apart.
The workers went on strike on Oct. 5 after their contracts expired the previous day, as negotiations over payment and benefits stalled due to differences between Kellogg and about 1,400 union members at its cereal plants.
After the latest setback in negotiations, Kellogg said it was left without a choice but to move to the next phase of its contingency plans, including hiring permanent replacements.
Union members previously said Kellogg proposed a two-tier employment system that did not offer its temporary workers, who make up 30% of its workforce, a pathway to become permanent workers with better benefits and pay.
Kellogg said on Tuesday it was ready to move workers with four or more years of service to permanent positions, but added that the union was not prepared to reach a deal and did not allow members to vote on the offer.
An update from the union earlier in the day said it still had to resolve issues related to the two-tier system and offered to meet again with Kellogg the week of Dec. 6.
The workers will be voting on an offer if the union and Kellogg could reach a tentative agreement, a union leader said.
""(The union) kept giving them counter offers but after 14 hours we felt like we (are) only negotiating with ourselves,"" Kevin Bradshaw, vice president of the local union in Memphis, said.
Kellogg has already brought in temporary workers to fill in for striking workers and is also importing cereals to ensure supply at a time corporate America is dealing with soaring expenses.
Earlier this month, the union rejected a revised offer from Kellogg.  read more ",0
394,"HONG KONG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism was sentenced on Tuesday to a total of 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering.
Tony Chung, 20, was charged with secession, under a sweeping national security law, and money laundering in October 2020 and was denied bail. Local media reported at the time that he was detained along with two others at a coffee shop close to the U.S. consulate by unidentified men and was believed to be preparing for an asylum application. 
Chung had entered a plea bargain, admitting guilt on the charge of secession and one count of money laundering and pleading not guilty to a sedition charge and another money laundering accusation.
The plea led to a 25% reduction in his sentence, to 40 months for secession and 18 months for money laundering. Only three months of the latter will be served separately, resulting in a total sentence of 43 months.
""He actively organised, planned and implemented activities to separate the country,"" District Court Judge Stanley Chan said.
Prosecutor Ivan Cheung has said the defendant acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organisation called the Initiative Independence Party.
Pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were also seized from his home, the prosecutor said. The money laundering charge was related to donations he received via PayPal.
Like other anti-government organisations, Studentlocalism disbanded before Beijing imposed the security law in June 2020, to punish anything it deems as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
The vast majority of Hong Kong people do not support independence, but any mention of the idea is anathema to Beijing.
Since the enactment of the security law, Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn, with most democratic politicians now in jail or in self-exile. Dozens of civil society organisations have folded, and some international rights groups have left the city.
Chinese and Hong Kong authorities deny the security law tramples individual rights and say the legislation was necessary to restore stability after mass street protests in 2019.
The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise -- an allegation that Beijing vehemently denies.

395,"JAKARTA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities are assessing a draft bill that could compel tech giants like Facebook (FB.O) and Google to negotiate with media firms for fairer revenues, media groups said on Tuesday, a move inspired by a groundbreaking new Australian law.
Wenseslaus Manggut, chairman of Indonesia's cyber media association (AMSI), which was involved in drafting the bill, told Reuters the aim was to ensure fairer revenues for outlets that produce core news and ""good journalism"".
Algorithms of big tech companies can have a significant impact on income for digital news media, by determining how prominently an article appears in a Google search or on a Facebook news feed.
The draft, seen by Reuters, has yet to go to parliament. It calls for an agency to negotiate between media firms and tech companies, and also requires big tech firms to do more to filter content for hoaxes.
""Under the current ecosystem, clickbait is more profitable,"" Wenseslaus said. ""It's hard to keep the integrity of journalism in this ecosystem.""
The Australian law has since March required Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google to negotiate with Australian outlets for content that drives traffic and advertising to their websites.
Many small Australian publishers have struggled, however.
Ross Tapsell, a media lecturer at the Australian National University, said the bill would be more advantageous to bigger industry players with political connections.
""Ultimately the concern is the smaller, independent media companies - whose mission is public interest journalism - may not benefit from this arrangement,"" he said.
About half of Indonesia's digital advertising revenues go to Facebook and Google, according to Amir Suherlan, an advertising expert and managing director of the agency Wavemaker Indonesia.
Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the bill.
Usman Kansong, from Indonesia's communications ministry, said the bill could ensure better revenues for ""quality"" media organisations, but it was unclear if it would be standalone legislation, or incorporated into an existing law.",0

397,"OXFORD, Miss., Nov 23 (Reuters) - Just months before she was set to start law school in the summer of 1973, Barbara Phillips was shocked to learn she was pregnant.
Then 24, she wanted an abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court had legalized abortion nationwide months earlier with its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling recognizing a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. But abortions were not legally available at the time in Mississippi, where she lived in the small town of Port Gibson.
Phillips, a Black woman enmeshed in the civil rights movement, could feel her dream of becoming a lawyer slipping away.
""It was devastating. I was desperate,"" Phillips said, sitting on the patio of her cozy one-story house in Oxford, a college town about 160 miles (260 km) north of Jackson, Mississippi's capital.
At the time of the Roe ruling, 46 of the 50 U.S. states had some sort of criminal prohibitions on abortion. Access often was limited to wealthy and well-connected women, who tended to be white.
With a feminist group's help, Phillips located a doctor in New York willing to provide an abortion. New York before Roe was the only state that let out-of-state women obtain abortions. She flew there for the procedure.
Now 72, Phillips does not regret her abortion. She went on to attend Northwestern law school in Chicago and realize her goal of becoming a civil rights lawyer, with a long career. Years later, she had a son when she felt the time was right.
""I was determined to decide for myself what I wanted to do with my life and my body,"" Phillips said.
U.S. abortion rights are under attack unlike any time since the Roe ruling, with Republican-backed restrictions being passed in numerous states. The Supreme Court on Dec. 1 is set to hear arguments in a case in which Mississippi is seeking to revive its law, blocked by lower courts, banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi has raised the stakes by explicitly askingthe court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Such a ruling could turn back the clock in Mississippi, which currently has just one abortion clinic, and other states to the kind of environment on abortion access that Phillips experienced nearly a half century ago.
Large swathes of America could return to an era in which women who want to end a pregnancy face the choice of undergoing a potentially dangerous illegal abortion, traveling long distances to a state where the procedure remains legal and available or buying abortion pills online.
Mississippi's abortion law is not the only one being tested at the Supreme Court. The justices on Nov. 1 heard arguments in challenges to a Texas law banning abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy, but have not yet ruled.
TRIGGER LAWS
Mississippi is one of a dozen states with so-called trigger laws that would immediately ban abortion in all or most cases if Roe is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.
Many are in the South, so a Mississippi woman would be unable to obtain an abortion in neighboring Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee or Alabama. The nearest states where abortion would remain legal, at least in the short term, would be Illinois and Florida.
The average distance a Mississippi woman would need to drive to reach a clinic would increase from 78 miles to 380 miles (125 to 610 km) each way, according to Guttmacher.
While some abortion rights advocates fear a return to grisly illegal back-alley abortions, there has been an important development since the pre-Roe era: abortion pills. Mississippi is among 19 states imposing restrictions on medication-induced abortions.
Mississippi officials are cagey on what a post-Roe world might look like. Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch, who asked the court to overturn Roe, declined an interview request, as did Republican Governor Tate Reeves.
Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson, who as a Republican state legislator helped shepherd the 2018 passage of the 15-week ban, called Roe v. Wade ""antiquated, old law based on antiquated and old science.""
Gipson in an interview declined to answer questions about what Mississippi - or the southeastern United States - would be like without abortion rights, focusing on the specifics of the 15-week ban.

398,"OSLO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Norwegian transmission grid operator Statnett said on Tuesday it is curbing electricity transfers to southern Sweden, cutting capacity by 1,000 MW, or 45%, in reaction to lower flows in the opposite direction.
Available capacity between Norwegian bidding zone NO1 and Swedish price zone SE3 will be cut to 1,100-1,200 megawatt (MW), Statnett said in a market message.
This compares to 2,200 MW total capacity between the two areas, Statnett spokesman Henrik Glette told Reuters.
Statnett said it will no longer apply so-called system protection settings, which increase trading capacity but also carry a certain operational risk, in a move that will align its practice with that of Swedish counterpart Svenska Kraftnaet.
""Transparency, reciprocity and common understanding are the cornerstones of the Nordic power system. We now experience that there is a need for a more similar practice in operations,"" Statnett Chief Executive Hilde Tonne said in the statement.
Norwegian energy regulator NVE-RME recently urged a higher level of transparency into the nature of the Swedish restrictions, which are expected to last until 2030.
""Given the magnitude and duration of the capacity reductions there is a need to turn every stone in order to find mitigating actions that could improve the situation,"" NVE-RME said in a letter to its Swedish counterpart seen by Reuters.
""Capacity reductions should only be used as last resort to comply with operational security limits,"" it added.
The closure of nuclear plants in the south-west and addition of new wind power in the north has changed the flow of power in Sweden, Erik Ek, strategic operations manager at Svenska Kraftnaet, told Reuters.
The Swedish transmission system operator is working on measures to alleviate the lack of available cross-border capacity, but it would take time to build out the grid, he added.",0
399,"AMSTERDAM, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Netherlands started transporting COVID-19 patients across the border to Germany on Tuesday to ease pressure on Dutch hospitals, which are scaling back regular care to deal with a surge in coronavirus cases.
A patient was transferred by ambulance from Rotterdam to a hospital in Bochum, some 240 km (150 miles) east, on Tuesday morning, and another would follow later in the day, health authorities said.
The number of COVID-19 patients in Dutch hospitals has swelled to its highest level since May in recent weeks and is expected to increase further as infections jump to record levels.
On Tuesday the country registered some 23,000 new infections in 24 hours. Weekly numbers from the national health institute showed 153,957 new cases were registered in seven days, a 39 percent rise compared to the week before.
On Tuesday  488 of a total 1,050 intensive care beds in the Netherlands were being used for COVID-19 patients. Hospitals were already scaling back other procedures including cancer treatments and heart operations, to make room.  read more 
The Dutch health authority (NZA) on Tuesday said almost a third of all operating theatres in the Netherlands had been closed to limit the use of intensive care beds.
Deadlines for critical operations can't be met in about a fifth of all Dutch hospitals, the NZA said.
German hospitals in total have offered 20 beds for patients from the Netherlands, after treating dozens during previous waves of the pandemic.
Plans by the Dutch government to impose further curbs to contain the virus prompted three nights of rioting starting on  Friday and more than 170 arrests in cities cross the country. read more

400,"DUBAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he wanted to deepen cooperation with Iran in his talks in Tehran, days before the resumption of negotiations between the Islamic Republic and world powers to revive a 2015 nuclear deal.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last week issued reports detailing its conflicts with Iran, from rough treatment of its inspectors to re-installing cameras it deems ""essential"" for the revival of the nuclear deal.
""The agency is seeking to continue and deepen the dialogue with the government of Iran...We agreed to continue our joint work on transparency and this will continue,"" Grossi, who arrived in Tehran on Monday, told a televised news conference.
Tehran and Washington will resume indirect negotiations on Nov. 29 in Vienna - on hold since June - to find ways to reinstate the deal abandoned in 2018 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who then reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran.
Tehran responded by breaching key limits on nuclear activity set by the accord, including rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.
A failure of diplomacy to bring back Tehran and Washington into compliance with the nuclear deal could raise the risk of a fresh regional war.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett signalled readiness on Tuesday to step up Israel's confrontation with Iran and reiterated that his country would not be bound by any new nuclear deal.
In September, Western powers at the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors scrapped plans for a resolution against Iran after Tehran agreed to prolong monitoring of some nuclear activities.
But they still demand Iranian action on two central issues - explaining uranium traces found at three undeclared sites and granting IAEA inspectors access to the TESA Karaj centrifuge component manufacturing workshop to replace the agency's surveillance cameras there.
The workshop was the victim of apparent sabotage in June in which one of four IAEA cameras there was destroyed. Iran has not returned that camera's ""data storage medium"" and the IAEA said it had asked Iran to locate it and explain.
""Some questions were raised based on documents published by our enemies. These questions have now been answered,"" Iran's nuclear chief, Mohammad Eslami, said after meeting with Grossi.
Grossi later met for the first time with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who urged the IAEA to ""continue to cooperate with Iran in the context of its technical duties, and avoid taking political positions"", state media said.
Diplomats say no action is likely to be taken against Iran when the IAEA board convenes on Wednesday, for fear of harming the nuclear talks between Iran and world powers.
Grossi had been due to hold a news conference upon his return to Vienna on Tuesday night but it was cancelled with less than an hour's notice. No reason was given. He will hold a separate, long scheduled news conference at 12:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) on Wednesday.",0
401,"BEIRUT, Nov 23 (Reuters) - More than half of families in Lebanon had at least one child who skipped a meal by October 2021 amid a ""dramatic deterioration of living conditions"", the UN's children's fund said in a report released on Tuesday.
Children have been hit hard by the country's deep economic crisis exacerbated by the global coronavirus pandemic which has left about eight in 10 people poor and threatens the education of some 700,000 children including 260,000 Lebanese, the report said.
The multifaceted crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement, has led to a breakdown in the provision of basic services such as electricity and water.
Nearly half of households had insufficient drinking water by October 2021, the report said, with a third of them citing cost as the main factor.
""The staggering magnitude of the crisis must be a wake-up call,"" said Yukie Mokuo, UNICEF representative in Lebanon.
The report noted that less than three in 10 families had received social assistance, leading them to take ""desperate measures"".
The proportion of Lebanese families sending children to work increased sevenfold to seven percent between April and October, the report said.
Prime Minister Najib Mikati's government has been slow to implement social safety programmes including a $246 million World bank-funded one adopted by parliament in March and a $556 million ration card scheme backed by the legislature in June.
""Urgent action is needed to ensure no child goes hungry, becomes sick or has to work instead of receiving an education,"" Mokuo said.",0
402,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Impossible Foods has raised nearly $500 million in a funding round led by existing shareholder Mirae Asset Global Investments, highlighting a surge in investor appetite for fast-growing plant-based meat makers.
The latest round makes the Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O) rival the most well-funded and richly valued plant-based burger startup in the United States, with more than $2 billion raised since its founding in 2011.
Impossible Foods, valued at about $4 billion in its last fundraise in 2020, did not disclose its latest valuation on Tuesday. The fundraise comes ahead of a potential U.S. stock market listing next year.
Reuters reported in April the Redwood City, California-based company was exploring options for going public at a valuation of $10 billion or more.  read more 
The biggest investors in the world have written large checks for plant-based meat makers in recent years, encouraged by a boom in popularity of products considered more climate-friendly and humane.
In March, plant-based meat startup the Livekindly Collective raised $335 million from investors such as TPG's The Rise Fund and Rabo Corporate Investments.
Impossible was founded in 2011 by Stanford University professor Patrick Brown who decided to change his career during a sabbatical in 2009.
Brown wanted to make the global food system sustainable by recreating meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. The startup debuted its first product, the Impossible Burger, in 2016.
It went on to secure backing from celebrities such as tennis star Serena Williams and rapper Jay-Z and has over the past 14 months expanded into four international markets - Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Australia and New Zealand.

403,"CHICAGO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - From offering premium pay to hefty signing bonuses or poaching workers from other airlines, American carriers are scrambling to ramp up staffing for the holiday season and prevent disruptions that marred air travel this summer.
After reducing headcount by thousands during the depths of the pandemic, the industry is grappling with shortages of pilots, flight attendants and customer service agents.
Critics say the staff crunch is of the airline industry's own making as the deep job cuts last year, despite an infusion of $54 billion in federal aid to help cover payroll expenses, left it ill-equipped to handle the snapback in air travel.
Airlines have said the bailouts saved thousands of jobs, prevented bankruptcy and put them in a position to support the economy's recovery from the pandemic.
A Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) spokesperson said the company had no furloughs or job losses related to the pandemic. However, the company did have about 18,000 staff departures last year in the form of retirements or voluntary separations.
With willing workers in short supply across the United States and companies frantically vying for them, carriers are  being forced to spend more to attract talent.
""The reality is that the hiring environment has changed as a result of the pandemic,"" American Airlines' (AAL.O) chief operating officer, David Seymour, told employees in a memo this month.
Piedmont Airlines, American's subsidiary, is trying to lure pilots with a $180,000 bonus offer. United Airlines (UAL.O) is offering a $5,000 signing bonus for a ramp agent position in Boston.
Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N) has bumped up wages for its ramp agents by 30%. The ultra-low-cost carrier is offering a one-time graduation bonus of $1,250 and up to $4,500 a year in tuition reimbursement to flight attendants.
The rush to hire in a tight labor market is driving up costs at a time when soaring jet fuel prices and higher airport charges are also squeezing profits.
Southwest Airlines' (LUV.N) wage expense as a percentage of revenue is up by 14 points this year versus 2019. There have been similar increases in salary costs at other carriers including United and American.
Yet headcount at U.S. scheduled air carriers in October was 14.3% below the pre-pandemic peak. By contrast, employment at restaurants and bars, struck equally hard by pandemic lockdowns, is just 6.4% below its peak before the COVID-19 outbreak.
FADING ALLURE
Industry experts attribute the sluggish recovery to the fading attraction of jobs with passenger airlines.
Wages for some entry-level airline jobs, particularly low-skilled ones, pale in comparison with those in other industries even as the work has become more challenging.
The situation is worse at regional carriers, which operate  43% of the flights of American, United and Delta. These companies provide connectivity to low-density networks, but their pilots and crews are paid far less.
Even at the regional airlines that are subsidiaries of American and Delta, the wage gap is huge.
For example, entry-level flight dispatchers at American earn more than twice the amount made by their counterparts at Piedmont Airlines. There is a similar gap between pay scales at Delta and its regional unit Endeavor Air.
Keturah Johnson, who heads the union for Piedmont's flight attendants, said a lot of workers have been forced to pick up a second job as the wages at the regional carrier are not high enough to cover living costs.
Piedmont's flight attendants last month voted to authorize a strike, demanding better pay and benefits. ""We are fighting for a livable wage,"" said Johnson.
A CRISIS LONG IN THE MAKING
Analysts say the labor crisis was in the making long before COVID-19 hit the industry. They trace its genesis to a wave of bankruptcies and consolidations after the 9/11 attacks, which made carriers too cost-conscious and excessively focused on productivity.
As airlines slimmed down, they became more reliant on employees logging more hours. The Association of Flight Attendants estimates the workload of flight attendants increased by at least 25% after 9/11.
The pandemic-induced plunge in air travel prompted the industry to double down on cost cuts, leaving it with the lowest headcount in more than three decades. Meanwhile, quarantine requirements or illness further depleted its resources.
""COVID was the tipping point,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group. ""It ripped the protective layer of the airline industry and exposed many of its underlying challenges.""
Airlines resumed hiring this spring as dipping COVID-19 cases brought passengers back. But the supply of new pilots is limited, and cargo carriers of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are also vying for them.
Faye Malarkey Black, head of the Regional Airline Association, said the supply of new pilots fell 60% in 2020. This year, it is about 36% below pre-pandemic levels, she said.
Worries about a looming pilot shortage have dogged the industry for years. That did not stop carriers last year from pausing hiring and offering buyouts and retirement packages to thousands of aviators.
SOARING ATTRITION RATE
Faced with a crunch, they are now heavily poaching from regional carriers.
SkyWest Inc (SKYW.O), which operates flights for Delta, American and United, last month said its attrition rate is running into double digits.
To be sure, regional airlines have been losing pilots to major carriers for years. But Black said that trend is now ""on steroids.""
Subodh Karnik, chief executive of Georgia-based ExpressJet Airlines, likened the demand for pilots to the frenzy in the U.S. housing market where houses are getting flooded with offers within days of their listing. He said one-fifth of the pilots at regional airlines are getting snatched away by big passenger and cargo carriers even before they can complete their mandatory training.
Inadequate staffing runs the risk of causing operational meltdowns of the kind that have led to a spate of high-profile flight cancellations in recent months.
Carriers such as American and JetBlue (JBLU.O) are offering bonuses, higher pay and other incentives to ensure they have enough workers for what is shaping up as the busiest holiday season in two years.
If the shortages persist, Karnik warned that major carriers could stop servicing less profitable routes.
United has decided to drop eight routes in the U.S. Midwest and South from its network. The airline's chief executive, Scott Kirby, told travel news industry website Skift last week that the cuts were the result of a pilot shortage.
""We don't have enough pilots to fly all the airplanes,"" he said.",0
404,"VIENNA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Austria's COVID-19 lockdown will have a ""very small"" effect on economic output this year but the current fourth wave of infections will probably inflict damage next year, the head of a top economic think-tank said on Tuesday.
Austria went into its fourth full COVID-19 lockdown on Monday, the first western European country to take the drastic step this autumn in the face of surging infections and dwindling intensive-care capacity.
Restaurants, cafes, bars and non-essential shops are closed except for take-away business for at least 10 days and no more than 20, the government says.
""The year 2021 is more or less in the bag,"" Gabriel Felbermayr, head of think-tank Wifo, which produces gross domestic product forecasts for the government, told a news conference. Wifo's last predicted GDP growth for this year was 4.4%.
""If November and December are significantly worse, there could be a revision. It would be within range. It would be very, very small,"" he said, adding that a week of lockdown costs about 800 million euros ($901 million) in lost economic output, rising to up to 1.2 billion euros the closer you get to Christmas.
This wave of infections could hurt Austrian winter tourism in particular, Felbermayr said, since infections are also high in Germany and the Netherlands, from where many tourists arrive.
Tourism accounts directly for about 5% of GDP. Ski lifts are now open but hotels are closed to tourists.
""The year 2022 is of course beginning weakly,"" Felbermayr said. Wifo last predicted 4.8% GDP growth for next year.
""It is clear that the current developments will result in a downward revision ... How big it will be will of course depend enormously on what rebound effects there are,"" he said, adding that GDP growth should remain above 4%.

406,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Market regulators set out a global framework on Tuesday to police environment, social and governance (ESG) investment ratings and help combat 'greenwashing' in the fast-growing, multi-trillion dollar sector.
Regulators are cracking down on many aspects of ESG investing with basic rules to make it easier to punish greenwashing, where the environmental credentials of an investment or activity are overstated, in a cross-border sector where investment is ""exploding"".
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which groups securities watchdogs from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, published 10 recommendations for its members to apply in day-to-day work.
""What we are trying to do now is put this foundation in place so we have some possibility to go after greenwashing and not just talking about it,"" Erik Thedeen, chair of IOSCO's sustainable task force and director general of Sweden's markets watchdog said.
Asset managers use ratings from about 160 raters such as MSCI, S&P Global and Morningstar to pick stocks and bonds for ""green"" products now popular with ethical investors, but there are no regulatory checks on how those ratings were put together.
IOSCO said its recommendations will begin shining a light on how ratings are compiled and conflicts of interest handled in a largely unregulated business which is already worth around $1 billion and growing at 20% a year.
It recommends that ESG ratings and data providers consider implementing written procedures to underpin high quality ratings, and make public disclosure a priority.
Some regulators are likely to go further, with IOSCO members Britain and the European Union having already expressed concerns over the lack of rules for ESG raters.
The recommendations will raise the bar to entry into the ratings sector, an official at a leading ESG rater said.
Earlier this month a new global body was set up to introduce rigour into how companies make ESG related disclosures. Until now, asset managers have relied heavily on ratings in the absence of high quality company disclosures.  read more

The contract has been awarded by Gas Natural Acu (GNA), a joint venture of Siemens Energy, BP (BP.L), Prumo Logistica and China's State Power Investment Corp (CPWRI.UL), and is the follow-up order to a first plant, GNA I, which entered service in summer.
Siemens Energy, which was spun off from Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) last year, did not provide a breakdown of the contract value for GNA II, which will start operations in 2023.
A person familiar with the matter said that the group's share was around 750 million euros, which covers a steam turbine, four electric generators and three heat recovery steam generators.
Siemens Energy will also provide long-term operation and maintenance of the plant, it said.
With 3 gigawatts of combined installed capacity, the two plants are the largest power project fuelled by super-chilled liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Latin America, producing enough energy for up to 14 million households.
""This project is strategic, not only for its grandeur, but also for its geographical location, close to the two main gas pipelines systems in Brazil, in the Northeast and Southeast of the country,"" Siemens Energy board member Jochen Eickholt said.
""And not to forget: Our gas turbines for GNA II are ready to burn hydrogen in the future.""

408,"OTTAWA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, opening a new parliamentary session on Tuesday, vowed to help British Columbia rebuild after the devastating floods last week, and said it was time to ramp up the fight against climate change.
Trudeau was re-elected on Sept. 20 for a third time, albeit with a second minority government that will need opposition support to pass legislation.
Work in the House of Commons, suspended since August, kicked off with a speech that Canada's governor general Mary May Simon, who represents its head of state, Queen Elizabeth, delivered on the prime minister's behalf.
""British Columbians are facing immeasurable challenges as their homes, their communities, and their well-being are impacted by terrible flooding,"" Trudeau wrote in the speech, saying the government will continue to support them.
He added that action to fight climate change ""must go further, faster.""
Last week's floods forced the closure of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and cut two critical east-west rail lines. The flooding underscored the vulnerability of Canada's supply chains to climate change, and looked set to be the costliest natural disaster to hit Canada.
The speech touched on many of the main themes of the election campaign, with Trudeau saying controlling COVID-19 remains his top priority. Canada rolled out the recently approved COVID-19 vaccines for 5- to 11-year-olds this week.
""The best thing we can do for the economy remains ending the pandemic for good,"" Trudeau wrote.
The government spent tens of billions of dollars to help individuals and businesses during the pandemic, but is winding down that support except for COVID-19 hotspots. Going forward, Trudeau wrote industries that still needed help would receive it.
The Liberal government will tackle the high cost of living by following through on a plan for more affordable housing and by ensuring families across the country have access to C$10-a-day childcare, the prime minister said.
""The government should stop pouring inflationary gasoline on the fire,"" opposition Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, said before the speech, calling for less spending. Inflation was at an 18-year high of 4.7% in October.
Later, opposition Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said his party can ""live with this empty piece of paper,"" referring to the speech, in a terse statement that signals the survival of the nascent government if there is a confidence vote approving Trudeau's priorities.

409,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields edged higher on Tuesday amid rising bets for a quicker tightening of Fed’s monetary policy after President Joe Biden tapped Fed-Chair Jerome Powell to lead the central bank for a second term.

411,"BUDAPEST, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Hungary's government expects its current account deficit to widen to 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) this year and a 2.9% deficit in 2022 as it feels the economic effects of the coronavirus crisis and delayed access to European Union funds.
Central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy last week warned of a rise in Hungary's vulnerability since the start of the pandemic, which triggered a fall in output that last year turned the country's current account to a 1.6% GDP deficit. 
The central bank, which was forced to ramp up its monetary tightening campaign this month amid a surge in inflation and a fall in the forint  to record lows, forecast a 0.4-0.9% current account deficit this year and a tiny surplus in 2022.
However, the government's latest forecasts, published by Finance Minister Mihaly Varga in the online edition of business daily newspaper Vilaggazdasag, project a much worse trajectory.
""These figures are less favourable than the surpluses seen earlier. However, combined with the likely still inflowing EU funding, they can keep our external financing capacity broadly balanced,"" Varga wrote in the newspaper.
That factor and a fall in net external debt can keep Hungary's external finances on a sustainable path, Varga said in contrast to Matolcsy, who said current trends in the budget, state debt levels and current account were unsustainable.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, facing a closely fought election next year, has showered the electorate with handouts, including a $2 billion income tax rebate for families, which has triggered a surge in the budget deficit.
Orban's government has borrowed heavily in global markets this year to bridge a delay in access to EU pandemic recovery fund over a row with Brussels on democratic standards.
Varga said foreign tourism would still not fully recover next year, while output in the autos sector, a mainstay of Hungary's growth, would be around 80% to 90% of the levels seen before the pandemic due to the global chip shortage.",0

414,"BEIJING, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Tennis star Peng Shuai's sexual assault allegation and its aftermath have brought the realities of China's censorship and secrecy around its leadership to global attention just as Beijing prepares to host the Olympics.
Peng, who was not publicly heard from for nearly three weeks after alleging that former vice premier Zhang Gaoli sexually assaulted her, told International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach on Sunday by video call that she was safe and well.
The Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which has led calls for an investigation into her allegations, remained unconvinced. Some Western governments and top current and former tennis players have called for reassurance that Peng is safe.
While the international furore has been awkward, experts say the priority for an increasingly confident Beijing is avoiding embarrassment at home for the ruling Communist Party and President Xi Jinping, an approach it will likely stick with even as the Olympics puts it on the global stage.
""For some years now, China has responded to negative global attention either by giving an unconvincing explanation, or by stoically pretending the criticism isn't there,"" said Zhang Ming, a retired professor of politics at Renmin University.
Beijing's censorship machine has allowed it to suppress the scandal domestically in China's tightly controlled cyberspace. Censors quickly deleted Peng's post on the Twitter-like Weibo on Nov. 2, and the topic remains blocked from direct online discussion, forcing people to use linguistic trickery to work around it.
But its attempts to control the narrative have jarred overseas audiences, and the case of Peng - a former Olympian and doubles world number one - has added fuel to calls from rights groups and politicians in some countries for boycotts of the Winter Games in February.
Efforts by Chinese state media journalists to allay concerns on Twitter, including the posting of a purported email from Peng saying ""I've just been resting at home and everything is fine"", were criticised by the WTA and some rights groups as unconvincing. Twitter is blocked in China and these journalists have not posted the same content on Chinese social media platforms.
Officials in China often speak about how the country must ""tell China's story well"" on the global stage, said David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research organisation in Hong Kong.
""In a single stroke, the Peng case has exposed the bankruptcy of these ambitions,"" he said.
China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China's foreign ministry has said, when asked, that Peng's case was not a diplomatic question, despite the concerns raised by the UK, United States, and France.
On Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged ""certain people"" to stop the ""malicious hyping"" and ""politicization"" of the issue of Peng.
'THE THING PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT'
While the Chinese government has been silent on Peng's allegations, Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin, a prominent state media journalist, has continued to comment on the case on Twitter, serving as de facto messenger to the world outside. He has not mentioned Zhang, the former vice premier, referring only to ""the thing people talked about"".
""Those who suspect Peng Shuai is under duress, how dark they must be inside. There must be many many forced political performances in their countries,"" he tweeted on Sunday.
But the episode is adding to calls for an Olympic boycott from rights groups and others already critical of Beijing over its policies in Hong Kong and the treatment of minority Uyghurs in the western region of Xinjiang. President Joe Biden has said the United States is considering a diplomatic boycott, meaning no U.S. officials would attend the opening ceremony.  read more 
On Monday, the Global Times published an editorial accusing ""anti China forces"" of trying to make trouble ahead of the Olympics and said it was ""not worthy"" for China to expend energy on the matter. It did not mention Peng.
Temporary disappearances from public life following a scrape with authority are not unheard of in China.
Alibaba founder Jack Ma disappeared from view for three months after blasting Chinese regulators in a speech last October. Fan Bingbing, an A-list movie star who appeared in the ""X-Men"" and ""Iron Man"" franchises, vanished from the public eye for four months in 2019 with no reason given until she was fined over $120 million by Chinese authorities for evading taxes.
A Chinese #MeToo movement took off in 2018 and spread to universities, NGOs, media and other industries but was largely stifled by authorities, with no cases involving any official approaching Zhang's rank.
The episode also demonstrated the extreme secrecy surrounding the country's ruling elite, with few details of their personal lives publicly available. Zhang, who retired from public life in 2018, has not commented on the situation.
In retirement, China's politicians largely drop from public view, appearing only at ceremonial functions.

415,"MUMBAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - India's fringe players will have a chance to impress in the absence of big names when the hosts kick off their two-match series against inaugural World Test Championship winners New Zealand at Kanpur on Thursday.
The series will be the first in the longest format between the two sides since they met in the final of the WTC but the setting and the personnel at Green Park will be starkly different from that June contest in Southampton.
It will also be India's first test series under head coach Rahul Dravid, a batting great who played 164 tests and 344 one-dayers between 1996 and 2012 and accumulated more than 10,000 runs in both formats.
Dravid succeeded Ravi Shastri after the Twenty20 World Cup and has already tasted success against New Zealand during the three-match T20 series, which his team won 3-0.
The hosts will be without captain and batting mainstay Virat Kohli, who decided to skip the first of the two tests, while batter Rohit Sharma, wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and fast bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami will miss both matches.
Batter KL Rahul was also ruled out on Tuesday due to a left thigh muscle strain and replaced by Suryakumar Yadav.
The side will be led by Ajinkya Rahane in Kanpur with Kohli returning at the helm for the second and final contest in Mumbai from Dec. 3.
New Zealand will also be missing first-choice players in pace spearhead Trent Boult and all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme and will have their task cut out against the formidable Indian spinners in their own backyard.
The touring side will also not find much confidence from their past record in India where they have never won a test series let alone a test match since the 1988/89 tour.
""They're one of the great challenges on the test calendar,"" New Zealand head coach Gary Stead told reporters on Tuesday.
""It's something we haven't done for a while, we haven't been here since 2016 but we're certainly looking forward to what's ahead.""
While the Indian batting and fast bowling department would need reinforcements in the absence of key players, the hosts have their first-choice spinners in Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel available.
In the absence of Pant, the experienced Wriddhiman Saha is expected to don the wicketkeeping gloves.
""We have that (home) advantage, but we can't take New Zealand lightly at all,"" India vice-captain Cheteshwar Pujara said.
""They've played excellent cricket and they're a good side in all the formats. We'll stick to our game plans, we'll stick to what we know, how to play in Indian conditions.""",0
416,"SOFIA/SKOPJE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A bus carrying North Macedonian tourists crashed in flames on a highway in western Bulgaria before daybreak on Tuesday, killing at least 45 people, including 12 children, officials said.
The cause of the accident was unclear but the bus appeared to have hit a highway barrier either before or after it caught fire, the officials said.
Seven people who leapt from the burning bus were rushed to  the Pirogov emergency hospital in the Bulgarian capital Sofia and were in a stable condition, hospital staff said. They had suffered burns and one had a broken leg.
Bulgaria's interior ministry said 45 people had died, making it the most deadly bus accident in the Balkan country's history.
Interim Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov said bodies were ""clustered inside and are burnt to ash"".
""The picture is terrifying, terrifying. I have never seen anything like that before,"" he told reporters at the site.
The accident happened on the Struma highway about 30 km (19 miles) west of Sofia around 2 a.m. (0000 GMT).
The coach party had been returning to Skopje, capital of  North Macedonia, after a weekend holiday trip to Istanbul, a trip of about 800 km (500 miles).
Bulgarian investigative service chief Borislav Sarafov said four buses from a North Macedonian travel agency had entered Bulgaria late on Monday from Turkey.
""Human error by the driver or a technical malfunction are the two initial versions for the accident,"" Sarafov said.
CRYING AND IN SHOCK
In front of the Ismail Qemali elementary school in Skopje, pupils cried after hearing news that five of their schoolmates, all from one family, had been killed.
""Ergin was my friend. He was a very good boy. Very nice. I am so sorry that they died,"" Blerim Bushi, 11, told Reuters.
In Sofia, Adnan Yasharovski, 45, said his 16-year-old daughter Zuleikha called him to say she had survived the crash, and he travelled to see her in hospital.
""She was crying. Her hands were burnt but otherwise fine,"" he told Reuters outside the hospital.
""She didn't say much, she was crying and she was in shock. I only saw her through the door as due to COVID, they did not let me into the room.""
Some relatives gathered outside the Besa Trans agency in Skopje, whose Facebook page advertised twice-weekly trips to Istanbul, and which Yasharovski said ran the trip. The office was closed and its representatives could not be reached for comment.
Television footage showed the bus standing upright but  charred and gutted by fire in the middle of the highway, which was wet from rain.
""This is a huge tragedy,"" North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev told reporters in Sofia and expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims.
Zaev said the passengers were all from North Macedonia but appeared to include a Serbian citizen and a Belgian citizen. It was unclear whether the two were among the victims or injured.
Zaev said he had spoken to one of the seven survivors who told him the passengers were sleeping when they were woken by the sound of an explosion.
He said people sitting at the back of the bus were able to break a window and jump out.
Zaev said the passengers were from various communities in North Macedonia, a country of 2 million that borders Bulgaria and is home to an ethnic Albanian minority.
In Skopje, ethnic Albanian Osman, 31, told Reuters he had come to the office of the travel agency with his brother and sister seeking information about their parents.
""We do not know if they were on the bus that crashed or not. We have no information about them. The agency is not answering the phone. Perhaps we will need to go to Bulgaria,"" he said.
Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka said the passengers were from North Macedonia's ethnic Albanian community.

419,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Britain sold 1.1 billion pounds ($1.47 billion) of a new index-linked gilt maturing in 2073 on Tuesday, which will pay investors a record-low inflation-adjusted yield for a bond sold via a syndication.
The nominal value sold was the lowest of any gilt syndication since at least 2005, after the country scaled back its 2021/22 issuance plans last month. The amount raised was around 3.9 billion pounds as investors bought the gilt above its par value.
Robert Stheeman, chief executive of the DMO, said the new bond represented Britain's longest maturity gilt.
""The issuance event represented a significant amount of risk for the market to absorb but I am delighted that the transaction was very smoothly executed against what has been a volatile market backdrop over recent weeks,"" he said.
Demand for index-linked gilts is generally high due to appetite from British pension funds and insurers who need to hold the debt to match long-term inflation-linked liabilities such as future pension payments.
Index-linked debt has drawn greater demand in recent months due to a surge in inflation that has pushed down inflation-adjusted yields to record lows. 
Retail price inflation, which is used as the basis for British index-linked gilts, jumped to a 30-year high of 6.0% last month, and typically runs around a percentage point above the consumer price inflation targeted by the Bank of England.
The transaction attracted more than 17.5 billion pounds of orders, and sold at a real yield of -2.3883%, meaning investors will receive a return 2.3883 percentage points below the prevailing rate of retail price inflation.
This is the lowest real yield of any index-linked gilt sold via syndication and 3.5 basis points below the current yield of  the benchmark March 2068 index-linked gilt .
A regular auction of 10-year index-linked bonds earlier this month had a record-low real yield of -3.242%.
Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility cut its cash borrowing forecasts for 2021/22 by 83 billion pounds last month, prompting the Debt Management Office to reduce gilt sales for the remainder of the financial year by 58 billion pounds.
The volume of gilts sold on Tuesday was far below the record 12 billion pounds sold at a syndication of a 10-year conventional gilt in May 2020, when Britain was rushing to raise funds at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The new index-linked gilt has a coupon of 0.125% and will mature in March 2073, making it the longest-dated index-linked gilt in issue. The March 2068 index-linked gilt had a longer maturity when it was first issued in 2013.

420,"SINGAPORE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has halved its crude processing capacity at its Singapore hub and reduced fuel exports, executives said on Tuesday, as the major transits from fossil fuels to cut emissions and meet global low-carbon energy needs.
The refinery on Pulau Bukom will continue to produce naphtha for its ethylene unit, Shirley Yap, senior vice president of chemicals and products at Shell Singapore, told reporters.
Shell has also started testing new chemical feedstocks - pyrolysis oil and bionaphtha - at the cracker, she said, as the major aims to supply olefins with lower carbon footprint to customers like Japanese chemical maker Asahi Kasei Corp (3407.T).
Shell is a key fuel supplier in Asia and the drop in exports has tightened supplies and propelled margins for refiners in the region back to pre-pandemic levels in recent months.
""The reality is that we've cut a substantial part of our capacity and there's demand for fuels today so we have to ensure that we are doing it at a pace that is in step with our customers and in step with the society,"" Shell Singapore Chairman Aw Kah Peng said.
""But at the same time ... it can't be turned on with just a flick of the switch as infrastructure needs to be build but we want to be there as quickly as we can,"" she said.
Shell will build its first pyrolysis oil upgrader to produce 50,000 tonnes per year (tpy) of treated pyrolysis oil for its 800,000 tpy cracker on Bukom in 2023.
Pyrolysis melts plastic waste into products such as pyrolysis oil, which can be upgraded as raw material for plastics and chemicals, although the process isn't commercially proven and consumes a lot of energy.
Other projects in Shell Singapore's pipeline include a carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub and a 550,000 tpy biofuels plant to process waste and vegetable oils into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Shell aims to make about 2 million tpy of SAF by 2025 globally although SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of today's global jet fuel demand.
The projects form part of Shell Singapore's plans to cut emissions from its operations by half by 2030, from 2016 levels on a net basis, Shell Downstream Director Huibert Vigeveno said.
Shell did not provide investment figures for the projects.
Energy companies are face increasing pressure from investors, activists and governments to steer away from fossil fuels and rapidly ramp up investment in renewables.
Globally, Shell has pledged to halve emissions from its operations by 2030, as well as reduce its net carbon footprint by 45% by 2035.  read more

422,"MADRID, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Spain on Tuesday approved a year-long extension, until the end of 2022, to restrictions on foreign takeovers of Spanish companies it regards as strategic.
As part of measures to protect Spanish firms in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, Madrid imposed a process of authorization for the acquisition by a foreign company of stakes larger than 10% in companies considered to be strategic.
The decision to extend the potential veto comes after U.S. firm KKR (KKR.N) offered to buy Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) for 10.8 billion euros ($12.2 billion) in what would be Europe's biggest private equity buyout.
Shares in TIM's Spanish rival Telefonica (TEF.MC) rose 6.4% on Monday on speculation it could also become a target, although they pared most of those gains on Tuesday as the government looked set to extend the restrictions. 
""It is a question of providing legal certainty and continuing to support companies so that they can progress in economic recovery,"" government spokesperson Teresa Rodriguez told a press briefing after a weekly cabinet meeting.
The extension applies to listed and unlisted companies if a potential investment exceeds 500 million euros ($562 million), Spain's Economy Ministry said in a statement.
The government has used the measure to delay a partial takeover attempt earlier this year of power utility Naturgy (NTGY.MC) by Australian investment fund IFM.
Its extension indicates that Madrid would not back a bid for Telefonica, which is considered a strategic asset, Caixabank BPI said in a note to clients.
The extended restriction, which also applies to bids from EU-based companies, is part of a series of wider measures announced on Tuesday. 
These include the extension until June of a programme of around 100 billion euros in state-backed loans and 40 billion euros in investments to help Spanish companies and households to through the crisis. 
The measures follow the EU's decision to prolong temporary state aid until June 2022 and investment support measures until the end of 2022.
Among others being rolled over in Spain are the extension of a moratorium on forced bankruptcy proceedings on companies.

427,"Nov 19 (Reuters) - An Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that overturned a $465 million judgment against Johnson & Johnson for allegedly fueling the state’s opioid epidemic raises questions in a related but quite different lawsuit.
The high court ruled that Oklahoma's public nuisance law does not extend to making, marketing and selling products, and said a lower court went too far in holding the company liable under the statute.
Generally, public nuisance laws protect shared property and rights. They’re historically linked to the use of land. Think of storing explosives or releasing noxious gas in a mid-city high-rise; or building a shed that juts into a public road, for example.
Over time, the theory has been extended to claims against parties responsible for harmful products, like tobacco and guns, with varying degrees of success.
Another lawsuit with similarly weighty implications for Oklahoma also relies on public nuisance theory. The case, Lessie Randle v. Tulsa, was brought in September 2020 by three survivors and other victims of the 1921 Tulsa massacre who are seeking remedies for some of the damage caused by and connected to the racist attack.
The lawsuit accuses the city, the Tulsa Regional Chamber and others of causing continuing harm to public health, and infringing on the right to use and enjoy one’s property in Tulsa’s mostly-Black north side.
Some observers believe the Johnson and Johnson ruling forecloses the arguments made in the Tulsa massacre case and other novel applications of public nuisance law.
Michelle L. Richards, a professor at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, wrote a law review article cited in the Johnson & Johnson decision which argues that public nuisance litigation is inappropriate in most cases involving lots of plaintiffs. She said the Johnson & Johnson ruling will be a major obstacle to the Randle plaintiffs, despite the ""horrifying"" underlying allegations in their case.
Attorneys for the Tulsa survivors ""will probably argue that the Johnson & Johnson decision is limited to products liability-type claims,"" Richards said. But ""they’ll still have to struggle with the very core of public nuisance theory: it's not used to address wide interference with private rights.”
There's some credence to that point, at least historically. Still, in my view, a balanced reading of the Johnson & Johnson ruling lends support to the Tulsa massacre survivors’ reparations case.
Damario Solomon-Simmons, the Tulsa-based lead plaintiffs' attorney, wasn’t immediately available for comment. He and other attorneys representing the survivors have filed a motion in the Tulsa County District Court requesting a hearing on how the Johnson & Johnson decision affects their claims.
City government officials didn't respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for the city and other defendants have argued that the statute of limitations for any claims have run out, and that survivors haven't demonstrated the specific harms they suffered in relation to the massacre.
The reparations lawsuit is often misunderstood as an allegation that a murderous ethnic cleansing event and a century of institutional racism amounts to a public nuisance. But it’s more accurate to characterize the central claims this way: specific acts during and in the wake of the Tulsa massacre constitute public nuisances because they were uses of property – or negligence related to property – that violated Black Tulsans' collective rights to their own property and community.
The complaint includes undisputed evidence that public safety officials started fires, and refused to put them out, for example. Businessmen and city official enacted bogus zoning laws that impeded reconstruction and deprived Black Tulsans of their homes.
Officials also designated Greenwood for industrial use, and refused to provide public utilities, like paved streets, running water and trash collection. And the complaint centers on officials' decision in the 1960s to place an interstate highway through the Greenwood neighborhood in order to displace Black residents.
In short, the lawsuit isn’t all about general racism or private rights – it includes allegations about specific acts and omissions, and about public rights to clean water and more. Theoretically, at least, the arguments in the reparations case aren't necessarily less plausible than the arguments in the thousands of lawsuits seeking remedies for the opioid epidemic under public nuisance theory (Keep in mind that some judges -- including the lower court judge in the Oklahoma case -- see those public nuisance claims as valid, and that defense attorneys and state officials are in settlement talks over some claims.).
The analysis in the Johnson & Johnson ruling itself also bolsters some of the Randle plaintiffs' arguments.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court’s ruling “draws a critical distinction in public nuisance law that strengthens our clients’ case,” Solomon-Simmons said in the November 12 motion calling the court's attention to the ruling.
First: the court did, in fact, take great pains to limit the ruling to cases about products.
""The nature"" of that case was  ""the marketing, selling, and overprescribing,” Justice James Winchester wrote. “This Court has not extended the public nuisance statute to the manufacturing, marketing, and selling of products, and we"" decline to do so.
The court also laid out three reasons why nuisance law “is fundamentally ill-suited"" to resolve claims against manufacturers: manufacturing or distribution itself rarely violates public rights; manufacturers relinquish control of products; and, it’s unreasonable to hold manufacturers perpetually liable for anything people might do with their products.
No ""analogous considerations are present in this case,” Solomon-Simmons said in his recent motion.
Lastly, the Oklahoma court made it clear that public nuisance claims are viable even when unconnected to land use:“We are not limiting public nuisance to a defendant’s use of real property,” Winchester wrote. (Also, recall that the Randle complaint does indeed include allegations about land use).
In my view, there is much in the Johnson & Johnson ruling that could support the Randle plaintiffs’ argument, and little that cuts against it.",0

""We expect potential of up to 10% for European equities until year-end 2022, albeit the path towards higher prices might not be smooth,"" he adds. This means the Euro STOXX 50 could reach levels around 4750 and the DAX climb to 18000 points.

SECOND INNING (0923 GMT)
Jerome Powell's second inning as Federal Reserve chair has brought out the U.S. dollar bulls in force. Money markets have advanced their expectations of a full quarter percentage point rate hike by June next year from September 2022, only a few weeks earlier.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields  are less than 10 bps away from 2021 highs while the U.S. dollar has barrelled past some important market levels against its rivals. What can spoil the party? An extended rise in bond yields can yank high-flying technology shares lower and weigh on the broader market, if last night's price action is any indicator.
Tech was the biggest drag overnight and growth shares were the biggest laggard after outperforming value stocks last week.

STOXX SLIDES TO 3-WEEK LOW (0855 GMT)
European stocks are set for their worst session in nearly two months as growing number of COVID-19 cases and rate hike concerns knocked sentiment ahead of flash readings on euro zone business activity.
The STOXX 600 (.STOXX) equity benchmark falls 1.5% to a 3-week low, with all sectors trading lower and tech stocks down a whopping 2.4%. More than 86% of the STOXX constituents were trading in the red.

MIND THE (EUROPE-U.S.) GAP (0820 GMT)
When advance prints of Purchasing managers' Indexes (PMI) land, focus will be on businesses' input cost increases and whether they show signs of easing.
The readings may also reinforce the gap between robust U.S.  activity and COVID-plagued Europe, potentially further depressing the euro, which plumbed new 16-month lows on Monday .
Monday's euro area consumer confidence indicator offered a warning, falling back below pre-pandemic levels. October PMIs showed bloc's activity slowing the weakest in six months, while businesses' costs rose at the fastest pace in two decades. U.S. and British PMIs fared better but eye-popping price increases still featured.
A price slowdown would vindicate central bankers' who have until now rejected surging inflation as transitory.

429,"BRUSSELS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - National judges in EU countries cannot be forbidden from seeking guidance from the European Court of Justice, the top EU court ruled on Tuesday in the case of a Hungarian judge who was disciplined for doing just that.
EU member Hungary is ruled by the eurosceptic and nationalist Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and, like Poland to its north, is trying to curb the independence of judges and their right to refer cases to the EU court.
Hungary's Supreme Court declared a request by a Hungarian judge to the ECJ for advice about arrangements for interpreters for foreigners accused of crimes unlawful. The judge was placed under a disciplinary process.
""EU law precludes disciplinary proceedings from being brought against a national judge on the ground that he or she has made a reference for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice,"" the EU court said, adding such disciplinary proceedings could undermine judicial independence.
""On the basis of the primacy of EU law, a national court must disregard any national judicial practice which is prejudicial to its right to make a reference to the Court of Justice,"" the court said.
""The principle of the primacy of EU law requires the lower court to disregard the decision of the supreme court of the Member State concerned,"" the court said.

430,"SHANGHAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK) on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected 8.2% rise in third-quarter revenue as smartphone sales growth stalled amid intensifying competition from rivals.
Shares fell nearly 7% at the market's open on Wednesday.
The company, which gets the vast majority of its revenue by selling mobile handsets, said smartphone revenue rose 0.4% to 47.8 billion yuan ($7.49 billion) in the three months to Sept. 30.
Yet smartphone shipments fell 5.8% on the year in the third quarter to 43.9 million units. The company pointed to the global chip shortage as the cause of the decline.
On an earnings call, Xiaomi president Xiang Wang said that the company is ""working hard"" to obtain supplies for 4G handsets in overseas markets.
He added that he expects the shortage to persist into the first half of next year, though he still anticipates Xiaomi will ""maintain very high growth"" in 2022.
Overall sales rose to 78.06 billion yuan in the July-September quarter, missing a market estimate of 79.20 billion yuan from Refinitiv.
Xiaomi, which had managed to grab market share in China after the retreat of sanctions-hit rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd (HWT.UL), has recently lost ground to not just top-sellers Oppo and Vivo, but also Huawei spinoff brand Honor.
Honor edged past Xiaomi to grab the No. 3 spot in terms of smartphone market share in China in the July-September quarter, according to Canalys.
Xiaomi's shipments in China grew just 4% year-on-year in the period, Canalys said. Overall smartphone sales in the country fell 5%.
Xiaomi has responded to the competition with aggressive pushing into brick-and-mortar retail. Last month, the company opened its 10,000th store in China, and committed to tripling that count over the next two to three years.  read more 
The company, which said in March it would spend $10 billion to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market, said on Tuesday it expects to launch mass production of EVs in the first half of 2024.
Xiaomi also makes money by selling online ads and other types of consumer hardware. Growth in its internet services unit, which makes money primarily by placing ads across various apps, jumped 27% year-on-year.
Excluding one-time gains and losses, Xiaomi earned 5.18 billion yuan in profit, largely in line with the average analyst expectations for 5.09 billion yuan.

431,"MILAN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Italy's antitrust authority has fined U.S. tech giants Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) a total of more than 200 million euros ($225 million) for alleged anti-competitive cooperation in the sale of Apple and Beats products.
Contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell Apple and Beats products on Amazon.it, the watchdog said, adding that this was in violation of European Union rules and affected competition on prices.
Both Apple and Amazon said they plan to appeal against the fines.
The authority imposed a fine of 68.7 million euros on Amazon and 134.5 million euros on Apple, ordering the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to Amazon.it in a non-discriminatory manner.
""To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,"" Apple said, denying any wrongdoing.
In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was ""disproportionate and unjustified"".
""We reject the suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success. As a result of the agreement, Italian customers can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store, benefiting from a catalogue that more than doubled, with better deals and faster shipping,"" Amazon said.

432,"ABUJA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria needs to end its costly petrol subsidy within the next three-to-six months, improve exchange-rate management and speed up other reforms to boost growth, the World Bank said on Tuesday.
The petrol subsidy has cost Nigeria 864 billion naira ($2.1 billion) in the first nine months of 2021, it said, up from 107 billion naira in 2020 and the highest deduction in six years, as oil prices  increase the cost of imports.
Zainab Ahmed, Nigeria's finance minister said the government planned to remove the subsidy by the middle of next year and replace it with 5,000 naira monthly payments to the poorest families.
Fiscal pressures have increased for Nigeria as higher petrol subsidy costs cut revenues, the bank said in a report, urging bold reforms to boost income.
""The Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy is eroding Nigeria's limited fiscal space to provide essential services,"" it said. ""Aggressive reform effort could contribute more to growth than a sustained period of high oil prices.""
Nigeria has fallen behind on implementing reforms started at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank said, adding that growth rates will lag those of other emerging economies, unless momentum is restored.
""The subsidies regime in the (petroleum) sector remains unsustainable and economically disingenuous,"" Ahmed said during the launch of the report.
The World Bank revised Nigeria's GDP projection to 2.4% this year, from 1.8% earlier, after the economy grew just over 4% in the third quarter, its fourth consecutive quarterly rise, following the COVID-19-induced recession in 2020. 
The World Bank said the economy's prospects have improved, but the recovery is fragile and action is needed to reduce poverty arising from high inflation.
""Urgent priorities for the next three to six months include reducing inflation, improving exchange-rate management ... eliminating the PMS subsidy ... and improving infrastructure,"" the report said.
The bank called for tighter monetary policy to attract investment, saying the naira's black market premium was fuelling inflation, as was the central bank's financing of the government's deficit.

433,"BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - More than half of German companies doing business abroad are suffering severe problems in their supply chains or logistics, pushing them to diversify suppliers, shorten delivery routes and even relocate their own production, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The German economy has boomed on the back of globalisation over the past decade. But pandemic-related disruptions in the worldwide network of supply chains that used to turbo-charge its growth engine are now proving a critical weakness.
Shortages of semiconductors and other industrial components are threatening to bring Germany's economic recovery to a standstill, forcing executives to re-think supply lines and try to reduce reliance on a handful of Asian and U.S. suppliers.
The survey by the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce among 3,200 of its members doing business abroad showed that the supply chain woes have become worse: More than half of the companies reported problems, up 14% compared to the spring.
""Rising global demand is currently coupled with insufficient production capacities and transport problems,"" DIHK trade expert Volker Treier said.
The reasons for the disruptions are manifold, ranging from a lack of containers and freight capacities on ships to production stoppages caused by COVID restrictions as well as missing components.
The supply chain disruptions can also be traced back to serious trade policy distortions by other governments, such as regulations forcing German companies to produce certain intermediate goods only locally, Treier said.
GIANT MARKET
In China, for example, companies are being forced to increase the share of local intermediate products in certain goods and segments - a task which is becoming increasingly difficult to manage for small firms, Treier said.
As China's giant market is too important to give up, medium-sized companies would therefore primarily look for new suppliers in the region, Treier said.
Eastern Europe is also benefiting from the trend towards diversifying supply chains or shortening logistics routes, with Ukraine and Serbia becoming more attractive, Treier said.
In view of those problems, 54% of companies are planning to adapt supply chains or have already done so, the survey showed.
Of those companies, 72% are looking for new or additional suppliers, 32% are planning to shorten or change delivery routes and 15% are determined to relocate their own production.
Important criteria when looking for new production sites are the availability of skilled workers (54%), the geographical location of the production site (43%) and general economic conditions such as taxes, customs duties or sanctions (43%).
The situation is particularly grave for German companies doing business in Britain: A total of 77% of those firms said they had to adapt their supply chains.
Of those companies, 93% said they are seeing themselves being forced to change delivery routes and 39% said they are planning to relocate production, mainly as a result of new trade barriers following Brexit.",0

435,"BUDAPEST, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Hungary's forint fell to a record low against the euro on Tuesday, while Hungarian government bond yields jumped, as a surge in COVID-19 cases and expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Hungarian central bank added to global woes.
Hungary's bond yields rose more than 20 basis points (bps) amid selling pressure triggered by factors including the forint's weakness, a trader said, adding that the rise in longer yields followed a jump in yields on the short end last week, when the National Bank of Hungary raised its one-week deposit rate by 70 bps to 2.5%.
""The short end was pushed higher already last week... and it seems the market's patience had run out and they started selling Hungarian bonds so we diverted from core yields,"" a fixed income trader in Budapest said, adding there was no panic selling.
Another trader also said there was no panic in the market, but rather a ""repricing"" as players expect more rate increases now.
He said the 10-year 2033/A bond was trading at 4.55%-4.6%, with the yield rising about 25 bps on Tuesday.
The 2024/C 3-year bond yield was up 20 bps. According to the fixing page of the state debt management agency AKK  benchmark yields rose about 27-30 bps along the curve from 3-year maturities upwards.
In the meantime, the Polish 10-year bond yield was up about 8 bps at 3.457%.
A strong dollar and worry over the worsening COVID-19 situation in central Europe has weakened the region's currencies in the past days. But the forint has underperformed its regional peers as concerns over high government spending and uncertainty ahead of the Hungarian central bank's deposit rate decision on Thursday added to concerns.
The forint  slid half a percent on the day and was trading at 371.91 per euro after falling to a historic low at 372 earlier in the session.
""The entire CEE region keeps being pressured by the strength of the dollar,"" an FX trader in Budapest said.
""But the forint was hit harder than the others. The somewhat uncertain rate hike cycle is not helping, neither does the high level of government expenditures in the run-up to the elections.""
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has announced a $2 billion tax rebate for families in 2022, paying an extra month's worth of pensions, scrapping income tax for career starters and other measures.

438,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The annual ""Miss America"" pageant, once a staple of prime-time TV viewing, is moving to a streaming-only event after years of sliding ratings and controversy over its role in the modern world.
Organizers said on Monday that ""Miss America,"" which marks its 100th anniversary this year, will air entirely on NBC's (CMCSA.O) Peacock streaming platform in December.
""We look forward to entering the streaming world with Peacock this year to help introduce our 51 outstanding individuals to a younger, broader audience and showcase their unique personal stories,” Shantel Krebs, a former Miss South Dakota and current chief executive of the Miss America organization, said in a statement.
The contest will take place over five days, with the Dec. 16 finale being staged in Uncasville, Connecticut.
Organizers said the decision was aimed at attracting younger and more affluent viewers who are accustomed to watching media on digital devices rather than on traditional television.

TV audiences dropped to an all-time low of 4.3 million people in 2018, when the swimsuit round was eliminated, and fell again to 3.6 million the following year.

439,"SINGAPORE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's Sinochem Group is in advanced talks with state-owned PipeChina for using the energy infrastructure firm's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals after it struck a U.S. deal to buy the superchilled fuel, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The move comes after state-owned Sinochem, traditionally an oil and chemicals trader, announced its first-ever deal earlier this month to buy LNG from Cheniere Energy (LNG.A). 
A deal for terminals with China Oil and Gas Pipeline Network, or PipeChina, is an important step in Sinochem's growth ambitions for LNG. For PipeChina, Sinochem will constitute a stable LNG customer and help offset weak demand from smaller importers due to volatile prices of the fuel.
China, which overtook Japan as the world's No.1 buyer of LNG this year, sees natural gas as a key bridge fuel along its path to reach carbon neutrality by 2060.
Sinochem and PipeChina did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Sinochem aims to sign long-term deals to use PipeChina's terminals, including the new 6 million tonne per year (tpy) facility in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, that's due to start next year, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they're not authorised to speak to media.
""The company may start with trading, while also anchoring on a few domestic outlets within its own system,"" said Chen Zhu, managing director at consultancy SIA Energy.
One such outlet would be Sinochem's wholly owned refinery complex in Quanzhou, near Zhangzhou, that will utilise gas to make hydrogen used for refinery and petrochemicals processing, the sources said.
As PipeChina opens up terminals to firms outside state majors like PetroChina , poor contractual performance by smaller importers in a volatile spot market is adding to the appeal of Sinochem. 
""PipeChina needs big players like Sinochem to commit to using the terminals to ensure reliable gas supplies,"" said one of the officials.
GAS TRADING
Sinochem started a Beijing-based gas trading team in early 2021, the sources said, joining national oil majors and local distributors such as privately controlled ENN Natural Gas Co (600803.SS) in vying for a slice of the world's top LNG import market.
""Sinochem entered the market at an opportune time, as the evolving market needs traders who can be a bridge between smaller Chinese buyers and large global portfolio suppliers,"" said a Beijing-based LNG trader.
The company's trading teams in Singapore, Japan and London, and state-backed credit lines, make Sinochem an attractive buyer for gas suppliers, said the second official.
Cargoes to be supplied under the Cheniere deal are on a free-on-board basis, which means the company can sell them inside and outside China.
Sinochem first eyed entering gas trading in 2017, but only became established in early 2021 when Zhong Ren, a 30-year Sinochem oil trading veteran, was appointed president of its energy business and mapped out the gas plan, sources told Reuters.
""Sinochem sees LNG as a new area of growth beyond its oil and chemicals business... Mr. Zhong plays a pivotal role in that push,"" said a company source.
Still, Sinochem faces hurdles like lack of a domestic gas client base, a new trading team, and shipping and logistical challenges.
""(The U.S. deal) marks quite an aggressive move for (Sinochem), a new player with little end-user base in China,"" said a fourth official, with a state-run gas importer.",0

After 50 years locked away in a vault, director Peter Jackson has edited 57 hours of footage into a documentary series that shows The Beatles jamming, dancing, joking, experimenting with new songs and working through their differences.
""This is the Beatles as you've never seen them before. As human beings,"" said Jackson, the New Zealand director of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and a Beatles fan.
Originally shot over 22 days in January 1969, the tapes offer a starkly different portrait of the Liverpool band in the months before their acrimonious split.
Contrary to perceived Beatles history that the four musicians could no longer bear to spend time together, Jackson found ""these four guys who are friends, who have a deep respect for each other.""
""Instead of shouting at each other and blaming each other and kind of going crazy, they just knuckle down, be professional, have a sense of humor and get on with it. And they end up with the triumph of the rooftop,"" said Jackson.
The three-part documentary ""The Beatles: Get Back"" will be released on Disney+ (DIS.N) on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
The tapes were recorded when Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr met to write 14 songs, record a new album and arrange their first live performance in three years. That now legendary Jan. 30 concert - on the rooftop of the Apple Corps headquarters in central London - was also their last.
As McCartney puts it at one point, ""The best part of us has been and always will be when we're backs against the wall.""
The tapes were originally filmed for a shorter, rancorous documentary - ""Let It Be"" made by Michael Lindsay-Hogg - that was released in May 1970 just after McCartney officially quit the band.
Jackson worked with the agreement of surviving members McCartney and Starr, the widow of Harrison, and Lennon's son Sean, but said none of them ever asked for changes or edits despite being nervous about the documentary's reception.
McCartney and Starr, he said, can barely remember the details of those days so ""they're essentially seeing it almost for the first time as well.""
""They also said it was quite stressful to watch. They're very aware that they are pulling the curtain away and you're seeing the Beatles in an intimate, raw way that they've never allowed themselves to be seen before,"" he said.
As a lifelong Beatles fan who names ""Penny Lane"" amongst his favorite tracks, Jackson attributes the continuing popularity of the Beatles to the range and infectious quality of their music.
""You can't imagine that the song 'Yesterday' and 'Revolution No. 9' came from the same band. If you played it to people that don't know in a million years they wouldn't think it was the same band.""",0

Following are the main points of the bank's post-meeting statement.
* Israel is continuing to enjoy an expansion of economic activity despite still coping with the COVID-19 virus. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding economic activity in the medium term, particularly regarding the state of the labor market, and in view of the risk of further morbidity cycles in Israel and abroad.
* To date, the only interest rate increases worldwide have been in countries where inflation deviated markedly from their targets, while inflation expectations in Israel are within our target range, and based on forecasts by the Bank of Israel Research Department and by forecasters, the inflation rate is expected to be lower in 12 months from now.
* During the reviewed period, there was a sharp appreciation of the shekel. The Bank of Israel has completed the $30 billion purchasing program that the Monetary Committee announced at the beginning of the year. However, the Committee emphasizes that this is not an upper bound for intervention, and that the Bank continues to act taking into account the state of the economy and the continuation of economic activity.
* Labor market data show that the economy is facing some difficulty returning to the employment and unemployment levels that were typical of the precrisis period.
* The Bank of Israel will complete its purchases of government bonds in the markets during December, which will bring to an end the bond market intervention programs that were announced during 2020.
* The Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct an accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, in accordance with the pace of growth, employment, and the path of inflation.
This is in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",0

State news agency KUNA said Sheikh Sabah, prime minister since late 2019, was reappointed by an emiri order issued by Crown Prince Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah. The government had resigned on Nov. 8 in the standoff with the elected parliament.
Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah last week temporarily handed over some of his main constitutional duties to the crown prince, his designated successor, including naming the prime minister and swearing in the cabinet.  read more 
Before doing so, the emir had accepted the government's resignation as part of measures to end a months-long deadlock between the government and opposition lawmakers. He also issued an amnesty pardoning political dissidents to defuse the row.
Several opposition MPs had wanted to question Sheikh Sabah on various issues, including the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and corruption, despite a motion in March that had granted him temporary immunity.
The row had paralysed legislative work, hindering fiscal reform efforts, including a debt law that would allow Kuwait to tap international markets.
State finances are set to improve this year thanks to higher oil prices, after the coronavirus downturn led to a budget deficit of 15.4% of GDP in the 2020/21 fiscal year.

The demand, from state communications regulator Roskomnadzor late on Monday, gave few details of what exactly the companies were required to do and targeted some firms that already have Russian offices.
Foreign social media giants with more than 500,000 daily usershave been obliged to open offices in Russia since a new law took effect on July 1. The list published on Monday names the companies for the first time.  read more 
It lists Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O), Twitter (TWTR.N), TikTok and messaging app Telegram, all of which Russia has fined this year for failing to delete content it deems illegal.
Apple (AAPL.O), which Russia has targeted for alleged abuse of its dominant position in the mobile applications market, was also on the list.  read more 
None of those companies responded to requests for comment.
Roskomnadzor said firms that violate the legislation could face advertising, data collection and money transfer restrictions, or outright bans.
KREMLIN CONTROL
Russia has taken steps this year to support and promote its domestic tech sector over Silicon Valley alternatives, proposing taxes on foreign-owned digital services, tax cuts for domestic IT firms and requiring smartphones, computers and other devices bought in Russia to offer users Russian software on start-up.
The campaign also has a political dimension that critics characterise as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet, something they say threatens to stifle individual and corporate freedom.
Those efforts include repeated fines for banned content and demands that Russian user data be stored on servers in Russia.
Authorities have also objected in the past to political opponents of the Kremlin using foreign social media platforms to organise what they say are illegal protests and to publicise politically tinged investigations into alleged corruption.
LACK OF CLARITY
But exactly what kind of representation the companies need to have in Russia is unclear, said Karen Kazaryan, head of analysis firm Internet Research Institute.
""There is no explanation in the law, no clarification as to what the legal form of the organisation's representation should be,"" Kazaryan told Reuters on Tuesday.
Roskomnadzor, when asked for more clarity, referred Reuters to its statement.
In addition to having representation in Russia, firms must open an account on the regulator's website and have a feedback form for interacting with Russian users, Roskomnadzor said.
""Foreign entities are required to limit access to information that violates Russian legislation,"" said Roskomnadzor, without providing further details.",0

CNN reported on Monday that Washington was considering sending advisers and new equipment including weaponry to Ukraine at a time when Russia has built up forces near the border.
""We are seriously concerned by Ukraine's actions on the line of contact in eastern Ukraine and the possibility of a Ukrainian decision to use force there,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a briefing.
Peskov said Russia had no plans to invade Ukraine and Ukraine could assure its security by returning to a peace settlement plan agreed with Moscow.",0

""That’s something to take into account and that should also be a measure for the recalibration of asset purchases that we need to undertake in December.""

448,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Britain's largest online electricals retailer AO World (AO.L) warned on Tuesday that supply chain issues, product shortages and rising costs were hammering its all-important peak trading period, prompting it to slash its profit outlook.
The company's shares, which have lost nearly 70% of their value since the start of the 2021, fell 27% on Tuesday after its second profit warning in two months.
Trading during the holiday season was significantly weaker than anticipated only eight weeks ago, the company said, with poor availability in certain categories, particularly new products. 
Retailers globally have been struggling with shortages and delays as economies opened up to stagnant supply chains and tightening labour markets. Britain is also adjusting to having fewer workers from the European Union.
""Our results over this period have inevitably been affected by the constraints and uncertainty seen across our industry,"" AO World founder and Chief Executive John Roberts said, while adding the company has cemented the progress of last year when profits tripled.
AO World, which sells laptops, washing machines, mobile phones and printers, saw profits soar during the pandemic as most people worked from home, but in October warned that profit would fall as a lorry driver shortage disrupted supply chains.  read more 
The company, which has recruited about 500 new drivers, said full-year sales are now expected to be flat to 5% lower.
It cut its annual adjusted core profit outlook to a 10 million-20 million pound ($13.4 million-$26.8 million) range for the 12 months ending March 31 next year, from 35 million-50 million pounds earlier.
It had reported profit of 64 million pounds for fiscal 2021, and an operating loss of 11 million pounds for the six months ending Sept. 30, compared with a profit of 16 million pounds a year before.
Earlier this month larger rival Currys (CURY.L) said it was well stocked for Black Friday and Christmas period despite supply chain disruption.

449,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Sometimes in life it pays to be strong, and unsurprisingly that seems to be the case with currencies too. It seems China is capitalising on this - and there are big rewards.
Germany's Bundesbank successfully utilised a strong currency policy for years but few other central banks have tried to mimic it, notably the European Central Bank which has a heap of issues with a falling euro, rising inflation and an economy struggling while the pandemic intensifies again.
Many central banks have weakened currencies for little reward: the BOJ and SNB spent vast quantities without impacting inflation, while others have tried to hold currencies down to boost their exporters only to find that investors don't like falling currencies and speculators prey on the weak. Turkey has thrown its lira to the wolves. 
China has taken the opposite tack, allowing the yuan to rise over 12 percent through the course of the pandemic. The trade surplus has grown, inflation is under control, and there's even talk about the yuan challenging for some of the dollar's reserve status. Investors like strong and rising assets, and those with a yield and low volatility like China's yuan are more appealing.

SECOND INNING (0923 GMT)
Jerome Powell's second inning as Federal Reserve chair has brought out the U.S. dollar bulls in force. Money markets have advanced their expectations of a full quarter percentage point rate hike by June next year from September 2022, only a few weeks earlier.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields  are less than 10 bps away from 2021 highs while the U.S. dollar has barrelled past some important market levels against its rivals. What can spoil the party? An extended rise in bond yields can yank high-flying technology shares lower and weigh on the broader market, if last night's price action is any indicator.
Tech was the biggest drag overnight and growth shares were the biggest laggard after outperforming value stocks last week.

451,"PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - France will try to cement deeper ties in the Indo-Pacific region when its foreign minister arrives in Indonesia on Tuesday as it counters the loss of a strategic defence deal with Australia in September.
Paris accused its allies of stabbing it in the back when Australia opted for nuclear-powered submarines to be built with U.S. and British technology instead of a multi-billion dollar French submarine programme.
Canberra pressed ahead with a trilateral alliance (AUKUS) excluding France, which it said was crucial to tackle the perceived Chinese threat in the region.
France's partnership with Australia dating back to 2016 was considered the cornerstone of its Indo-Pacific policy and since losing that deal, Paris has been on the offensive to strengthen its ties in the region with high-level meetings ranging from Japan to India and Vietnam.
""This trip is about reaffirming France's commitment to the Indo-Pacific ... and to intensify the relationship with Indonesia,"" a French diplomatic source told reporters in a briefing ahead of Jean-Yves Le Drian's two-day visit.
Key to developing that relationship will be closer military cooperation. Indonesia wants to boost its defence capabilities, including with the possible purchase of submarines, warplanes and warships, amid ongoing tensions with China in the disputed South China Sea.
France has been negotiating with Jakarta for several months the sale of 36 Rafale fighter jets. It signed a letter of intent in June, although officials do not expect a deal to be agreed before the end of the year due to financing issues.
""The French are doubling down on other Indo-Pacific relations, including Indonesia, in a sense to compensate for losing the Australians,"" an Indo-Pacific diplomat said.
Highlighting just how angry Paris is with Canberra, a two-minute video announcing Le Drian's trip to Indonesia outlined its Indo-Pacific strategy naming numerous regional countries with the exemption of Australia.",0

453,"DUBAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates energy minister said on Tuesday he saw no logic in the Gulf OPEC producer supplying more oil to global markets when all indicators pointed to a supply surplus in the first quarter of next year.
Suhail Al-Mazrouei, speaking to reporters, also described as a ""state matter"" moves by the United States to release crude oil from its strategic reserves in coordination with major Asian energy consumers in a bid to lower energy prices.
""We are looking at all technical data and all of them are suggesting we are having a surplus in the first quarter so there is no logic of increasing our contribution,"" he said, adding there should also be no supply worries in the second quarter.
The minister said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, would meet on Dec. 2 and base decisions on ""balance of supply and demand"".
OPEC+, which includes Russia, has resisted requests from Washington and other consumer nations for swifter hikes, sticking to its plan of gradually raising output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month since August.
The White House said on Tuesday that the United States would release 50 million barrels of crude from strategic reserves.  read more 
""I think the actions from countries to bring back some of their reserves is a state matter and they don't consult with us when they increase their SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserves) or decrease it,"" Mazrouei said.
The minister earlier told a business event at the Expo 2020 world fair in Dubai that the UAE has started building ""the first green hydrogen plant in the Middle East"" with testing currently underway. He gave no further details.
The UAE has announced plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and has said it would oversee 600 billion dirhams ($163 billion) in investment in renewable energy.  read more 
So-called green hydrogen, created by splitting water into its two components using electricity from renewable energy sources, is increasingly viewed as a fuel of the future to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels.
The UAE has said it aims to capture 25% of the global hydrogen fuel market by 2030.  read more ",0
454,"BANGKOK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Thailand on Tuesday ordered an additional 30 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech's (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine, government spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana said, with delivery expected to begin in the first quarter of next year.
The latest order is on top of 30 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots due to arrive this year and 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine slated for 2022.
Thailand, which manufactures AstraZeneca vaccines, has so far inoculated about 54% of the 72 million people in the country.
Thailand's main vaccination drive in June had a slow start, due to vaccine shortages and registration problems as the country struggled to quell the Delta variant, with over 200 daily fatalities and 23,000 new infections peaking in August.
The rate of infections has since slowed with more vaccines and partial lockdowns in higher risk areas.
Thailand, which reported 5,126 new infections and 53 deaths on Tuesday, has recorded more than 2 million infections and 20,489 deaths overall.
The country also has ordered 50,000 courses of Merck & Co's (MRK.N) Molnupiravir antiviral pill for COVID-19 treatment and is in discussions with Pfizer for its Paxlovid pill.",0
455,"SATARA, India, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Indian farmer Suresh Dhane harvested soybeans from an acre of land nearly a month ago, but like millions of others has been holding onto his crop instead of selling it to oilseed processors, hoping prices will rise.
Slow farmer selling has reduced oilseed crushing in India and could force the country to increase imports of edible oils such as soyoil, palm oil and sunflower oil even as local soybean output is expected to rise by more than a tenth from a year ago.
""Last year I sold soybeans immediately after harvesting at 4,000 rupees ($53.70) per 100 kg and within a few months prices spiked above 9,000 rupees,"" Dhane said as he was drying soybeans outside his home.
""I am not going to repeat the mistake. I won't sell below 7,000. I can wait for a few months.""
At the beginning of the 2020/21 marketing year in October 2020, soybean futures  were trading at around 3,800 rupees, but prices jumped to a record 10,680 rupees in August 2021 on lower output and strong demand from the poultry industry.
The price rally prompted farmers to expand soybean planted area as sowing of summer-sown crops started in June.
But before farmers could harvest their new crops, New Delhi took a series of measures to lower soymeal and edible oil prices, including allowing the first ever imports of genetically modified soymeal and slashing edible oil import taxes.
Those steps sparked a collapse in local soybean futures to around 5,200 rupees by late October, before the market slowly recovered to around 6,600 rupees this week, or more than a third below early August levels.
LOWER CRUSH
Most big growers have opted to hoard their harvest rather than sell, in anticipation that prices will rise during the lean supply season, said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India.
That resulted in lower sales to soy processors during October, when soy crushing traditionally picks up. October's crush total was 37% below last year's, according to the Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA), and is expected to stay below normal in November, said Manoj Agrawal, managing director at exporter Maharashtra Oil Extractions.
The lower soy crush levels are in turn leading to lower soybean meal supplies just as feed demand from the poultry sector has recovered, Agrawal said.
The All India Poultry Breeders Association last week requested the government to allow imports of 550,000 tonnes of soymeal.
It has also disrupted normal supply patters for oil mills and refiners, raising the prospect of higher imports from the top edible oil consumer.
""Everybody thought soybean crushing will pick up from mid-October and enough local soyoil would be available in the market. But that is not happening. We need to import more,"" said a dealer with a global trading firm.
India's edible oil imports in November could rise to 1.3 million tonnes compared to 1.1 million tonnes a year ago, the dealer said.

456,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth unexpectedly accelerated this month but another wave of coronavirus infections and new restrictions, alongside price pressures, are likely to put a dent in December's expansion, a survey showed on Tuesday.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a good indicator of overall economic health, jumped to 55.8 in November from 54.2 in October.
That exceeded all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted a drop to 53.2. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The flash PMI's for November surprised to the upside in the euro zone, France and Germany,"" said Rory Fennessy at Oxford Economics.
""However, with cases rising sharply in some euro zone countries, the near-term outlook is quickly turning more pessimistic as risks of another dangerous wave of coronavirus ramp up. A deterioration in sentiment in December is likely.""
Growth in Germany's private sector accelerated slightly but persistent supply bottlenecks in manufacturing continued to weigh on factory output and pushed up inflationary pressures to unprecedented highs, earlier data showed.
French business activity also expanded faster than expected, initial estimates showed, as the services sector of the euro zone's second-biggest economy saw its quickest growth in almost four years.
But European stocks slumped to three-week lows on Tuesday as the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and rate hike concerns knocked sentiment.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's renomination has buoyed bets on U.S. rate hikes in 2022 while British businesses reported the fastest growth in new orders since June alongside record cost pressures, possibly paving the way for a Bank of England rate rise in December.
The BoE will be the first major central bank to raise interest rates but whether that initial increase comes as soon as next month or if it waits until early next year divided economists polled by Reuters earlier this month.
PRICE PRESSURES
Supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic have made it a sellers' market for raw materials and the composite input prices index surged to 75.9 from 73.2, by far the highest since the survey began in mid-1998.
Still, a PMI for the bloc's dominant services industry rose to 56.6 from 54.6, well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had predicted a fall to 53.5.
But optimism waned as renewed lockdowns are likely to have a bigger impact on services. The business expectations index sunk to 66.6 from 69.0, its lowest reading since February.
Manufacturing activity remained robust and the factory PMI rose to 58.6 from 58.3. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, increased to 53.8 from 53.3.
Demand remained strong and factories were able to pass on some of the record increase in raw material costs to customers. The output prices index jumped to 74.3 from 72.6, the highest since the IHS Markit began collecting the data 19 years ago.
""The surveys show price pressures remain intense, with the output prices PMIs for both manufacturing and services rising to their highest in almost two decades, consistent with our view that headline inflation will remain high for some time,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
The PMIs casts some doubt on the European Central Bank's claim the rise in inflation is transitory. Euro zone inflation expectations are at risk of continuing to overshoot the Bank's 2% target next year, according to a Reuters poll earlier this month.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told Bloomberg in an interview euro zone inflation would be higher next year than previously thought and there is a risk price growth could stay above the Bank's target in the medium term.",0

""Markets are taking every USD strength story they can get in this environment, which is visible in the moves after Powell's widely expected reappointment,"" said Ima Sammani, FX market analyst at Monex Europe.
Sammani said the dollar strength was also due to rising front-end U.S. yields, which was likely caused by commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers. They include Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, who said on Monday that speeding up the tapering of asset purchases could give the Fed more room for rate hikes in 2022.  read more

Ninson estimates that he now owns the world's largest collection of books with images taken in Africa or by photographers of African descent. Thanks to a $1 million crowdfunding windfall, he has already started shipping the trove to West Africa.
""For so long we've let other people tell our stories and distribute our stories,"" Ninson said in one of his 16 New York storage units, crammed with ceiling-high stacks of books.
""That is the space I want to fill, to be able to give the tools and resources to African photographers and to black people to be able to tell our own stories,"" Ninson said.
He started the hobby shortly after arriving in New York on a photography scholarship in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic encouraged the obsession as struggling bookshops offloaded their inventories at reduced rates.
He acquired around 15,000 books that way, working odd jobs and taking out personal loans to cover costs. The collection now includes every issue of National Geographic from the last 40 years.
""Some of these pictures are incredible ... but sometimes I wonder what people in those communities contributed to these stories,"" Ninson said, flipping through the pages of one of the magazines.
""Do people in these communities accept how they are being depicted, especially the Africans?,"" Ninson wondered.
His dream of using the books to set up Africa's largest photography library in Ghana became a reality after popular blog ""Humans of New York"" promoted a crowdfunding campaign for his project that raised $1 million in a single day.
Ninson has doubled his collection since then, travelling up and down the east coast of the United States in search of new acquisitions. More than 18,000 books have already been shipped to Ghana.
The funds will help build the library in the capital Accra. Named after the word for 'Take the Lead' in his local language, the Dikan Centre will also offer workshops, equipment hire and studio space to aspiring African photographers.
""There are a lot of people in Ghana who are desperate to be photographers, to tell the stories of Africa,"" Ninson said. ""These books are going to be the backbone.""",0

461,"TAIPEI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan and the United States discussed chip shortages and how to respond to China's economic ""coercion"" during the second session of an economic dialogue launched last year, Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said on Tuesday.
The talks came a week after a virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. After that  meeting, Xi warned that supporters in the United States of Taiwanese independence were ""playing with fire"".  read more 
China claims fiercely democratic Taiwan as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to ensure eventual unification.
Speaking to reporters in Taipei after five hours of online talks, led on the U.S. side by Under Secretary of State for economic growth, energy and the environment, Jose Fernandez, Wang said they discussed supply chain collaboration, including on semiconductors.
""The semiconductor portion included the present short-term supply chain bottleneck problem. Even more important is the future long-term collaboration,"" she added.
Chip powerhouse Taiwan has said it is doing all it can resolve the global shortage of semiconductors, and has been especially keen to show the United States, its most important international backer, that it takes the problem seriously.
How to respond to China's economic ""coercion"" also came up, Wang said, focused on Lithuania which has faced pressure from Beijing for allowing Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in its capital Vilnius.
""We all share the belief that all countries, all economies, should not be subject to this kind of external coercion,"" she added.
China downgraded ties with Lithuania on Sunday over the spat.
Taiwan hopes the dialogue may lead eventually to a free-trade agreement with the United States and hailed last year's inaugural meeting as a step forward.
It was part of increased U.S. engagement with Taipei under former President Donald Trump that the Biden administration has continued, to the anger of Beijing.
The two sides held long-delayed talks on a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement virtually in July, and Taiwan said it hoped it would be possible to sign an FTA one day.  read more ",0

463,"COLOMBO/MUMBAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is expected to raise rates a second time since the onset of the pandemic on Thursday to curtail inflationary pressures, manage external challenges and attract foreign inflows, economists and analysts said.
Seven out of 12 economists polled, expect the CBSL to increase the standing deposit facility rate and the standing lending facility rate by at least 25 and a maximum of 50 basis points (bps) each on Thursday.
The Sri Lankan central bank in a surprise move raised rates by 50 bps each in August while also increasing the statutory reserve ratio by 200 bps but kept rates unchanged in October as it shifted its focus back to economic growth.
""An increased rate would aid in combating the pressure on the rupee to depreciate as a result of the upcoming external debt repayments and increasing pressure to allow imports back in,"" said Rehana Thowfeek, an independent economic analyst.
""It will also aid in mopping up excess liquidity resulting from money creation,"" she added.
But several other economists said the central bank might prefer to stay on hold this week to support the nascent economic recovery with inflation still largely driven by supply.
The Colombo Consumer Price index rose to 7.6% in October from 5.7% in September, above the central bank's 4%-6% target range.
""Next year the fiscal deficit is expected to almost entirely be financed through domestic borrowings,"" said Lalinda Sugathadasa, research head at ICRA Lanka, adding that CBSL would likely keep rates on hold to keep debt service costs low.
Most analysts said a rate increase would not help address the country's debt repayment challenge but remained important.

464,"SEOUL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A policewoman's failure to intervene in a stabbing incident has re-ignited a debate over passive policing in South Korea, with some leading conservatives saying the campaign to increase the number of female officers in the force has gone too far.
Stepping into storm caused by last week's incident in the city of Incheon, lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party called on the national police chief on Tuesday to express their misgivings.
""The Police Act stipulates that the top priority is to protect people's lives and health, as well as to prevent and suppress crimes, but the Incheon incident was a complete retreat (by the officer),"" lawmaker Oh Yeong-hwan said, according to Yonhap news agency.
On Monday, President Moon Jae-in said it was not a gender issue, but rather a matter of duty for the police to serve and protect the public.
According to reports, police had been responding to a complaint over a noisy neighbour. The man accused of being too noisy then stabbed a woman, who had complained about him, in the neck as she spoke to the female officer.
Rather than seeking to subdue the man, the policewoman, who was armed with at least a Taser, ran downstairs to seek help from her male partner, according to the reports.
The partner then used his Taser to subdue and arrest the man. Police would not confirm if either officer had a gun. The victim of the attack has remained in hospital after receiving emergency surgery, media reports said.
A petition launched by the victim's family calling for punishment of the police gathered more than 230,000 signatures in three days, passing a threshold needed to trigger a government response.
Such controversies have plagued South Korea's police for years. In 2018, officers armed with guns and batons were filmed standing by as seven people assaulted a man who eventually lost the sight in one eye from his injuries.
While excessive use of force by police can be a problem in some countries, like the United States, police in South Korea have been criticised for taking a passive approach despite manuals that empower them to use force if necessary, said Lee Yung-hyeock, a professor of police science at Konkuk University.
""There is a clear lack of field training,"" he said, adding that the potential for criminal liability is also deterrent for officers using force, like Tasers.
National Police Commissioner General Kim Chang-yong apologised for the incident on Sunday and removed the head of the regional police station. An internal investigation has been ordered into the conduct of the two officers.
Lee Jun-seok, the head the conservative People Power Party, seized on the case on Monday, saying gender equality measures may be weakening the force.
Hiring practices adopted to boost the number of female  recruits should be ended to help ensure that police officers are hired only on merit, said Lee, who has loudly criticised  feminism and equality programs, saying they had gone too far.
South Korea aims to raise the number of policewomen to 15% of the 130,000-strong force in 2022, up from 13.4% as of December 2020.
The police announced plans in June to upgrade assessment for physical fitness when hiring policewomen and match the standards for men after criticism of double standards.",0

467,"MOSCOW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Poland raised its seaborne oil imports as well as crude supplies from Saudi Arabia to multi-year highs in October amid tensions with neighbouring Belarus and talks on new supply deals with Russia, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and traders.
Relations between Belarus and the European Union have hit their lowest point this autumn since the Cold War as several thousand migrants from the Middle East arrived in the ex-Soviet republic hoping to cross the border into the EU.  read more 
Belarussian authorities have also threatened to block Russian natural gas exports to Poland amid the stand-off.
The data showed that the Polish port of Gdansk had boosted oil imports last month to the highest level since May 2019, when supplies from Russia via the Druzhba pipeline were halted over contamination.
According to Reuters' calculations, Poland imported some 2 million tonnes through the port last month, amounting to around three quarters of the needs of the local refineries.
""The increase in seaborne imports is part of a strategy to safeguard independence from the eastern neighbours,"" a source at an oil major told Reuters about Poland's move to increase supplies via Gdansk.
Traders said supplies of Russian Urals oil blend via the Druzhba pipeline stood at 610,000 tonnes in October compared to some 2.0 million tonnes via Gdansk, of which at least 800,000 tonnes were the Arab Light blend from Saudi Arabia, the highest level in the past few years.
Traders said the Russian Urals blend is cheaper than the Arab Light, but this has not stopped Poland from raising its imports from the Middle East.
Negotiations for new deals on Russian oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline to Poland have been underway, including with Russian oil majors Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Tatneft (TATN.MM).",0

469,"BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Germany should impose further restrictions to try to stop a fourth wave of coronavirus infections, outgoing Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday as more politicians backed the idea of compulsory vaccinations.
The surge in infections comes at a difficult time as Chancellor Angela Merkel is preparing to hand over to a new government after a national election in September.
The leaders of the Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats, who are trying to form a new coalition, were due to break off their talks on Tuesday to meet Merkel to discuss the pandemic, sources close to the negotiations told Reuters.
The three parties are in the final stages of clinching a coalition agreement and hope to present the deal on Wednesday, one source close to the talks said.  read more 
But it is the German regions, rather than the federal government, that have most of the powers to impose restrictions to rein in the pandemic.

Spahn said more public spaces should be restricted to those who were vaccinated or recently recovered from COVID-19 and also had a negative test.
""We are having to move patients around as intensive care units are full and that doesn't just affect COVID-19 patients,"" he told Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio.
Many German regions have already started to impose tighter rules, including demanding that vaccinated people show a negative test to attend indoor events.
On Monday, Spahn said that by the end of the winter almost everyone in Germany would be ""vaccinated, recovered or dead"".

471,"BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Growth in Germany's private sector accelerated slightly in November, but persistent supply bottlenecks in manufacturing continued to weigh on factory output and pushed up inflationary pressures to unprecedented highs, a survey showed on Tuesday.
IHS Markit's flash Germany composite purchasing managers' index rose to 52.8, a two-month high, from 52.0 in October. This was stronger than a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a decline to 51.0 in November. A reading above 50 marks growth in activity.
IHS Markit economist Lewis Cooper said the data showed that the slowdown in economic growth seen across Germany's private sector over the previous three months was levelling off.
Export orders in Europe's biggest economy showed a more resilient trend, but overall new work increased at the weakest rate since February.
The flash PMI for manufacturing edged down to 57.6, a 10-month low, from 57.8 in the previous month.
The services sector showed signs of better growth prospects despite a recent surge in COVID-19 infections, with the services PMI activity index rising to 53.4, a two-month high, from 52.4 in October.
Material shortages and supply chain issues, combined with higher energy and wage bills, led to an unprecedented rate of cost inflation which in turn led many firms to raise their own charges to a record degree, the survey showed.
""This subsequently knocked on to business confidence in November, with sentiment the lowest for over a year as many firms cited concerns around the pandemic, supply problems and price pressures,"" Cooper said.
The German central bank said on Monday that the economy could stagnate in the final quarter of this year as a lack of goods and labour as well as new restrictions to fight the coronavirus pandemic might put an end to its recent recovery.  read more ",0
472,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields jumped and southern European bonds underperformed on Tuesday, with investors ramping up their bets on a European Central Bank rate hike next year as the bank's policymakers began casting a wary eye on upside inflation risks.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel flagged the risk of inflation staying above the ECB’s target in the medium term, and Dutch central bank governor Klaas Knot said the post-pandemic inflation outlook justified a reduction in monetary stimulus. 
Even Irish central bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf, who was more cautious, recognised risks to the inflation outlook.  read more . Policymakers also added to predictions that the ECB's pandemic bond purchases (PEPP) will end in March.
Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING, said euro zone bond yields were rising because ""the message is that the ECB is increasingly focused on inflation upside, that it is not going to change its plan to end PEPP in March, and is in no rush to boost the (asset purchase programme) after that"".
Tuesday's comments also prompted money markets to resume betting fully on a 10 basis-point hike from the ECB by the end of 2022, compared with only a 50% probability of such a move as of Monday.
Yields on 10-year Italian and Greek bonds, among the biggest stimulus beneficiaries, rose some 10 basis points each to 1.05% and 1.3% respectively, the highest since early November. ,
The gap between 30-year Italian and German bond yields rose to the highest since November 2020 at nearly 180 bps.
Southern European bonds came under particular pressure as they face a stability test as the PEPP, under which the ECB can purchase debt more flexibly than for its conventional bond purchases, expires next year. 
Beyond PEPP, the ECB maintains that it will end its asset purchases shortly before it hikes rates, so hike bets also exacerbate pressure on the bonds, a concern that sent yields surging in October. 
Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was up 6.5 bps to -0.23%, its highest in a week.
Despite policymakers' concerns, a market gauge of long-term inflation expectations fell to the lowest in over a month at 1.8292%. . Inflation-adjusted, real yields jumped, with Germany's rising as much as 10 bps to highest in nearly three weeks.
Yields also rose after November business activity data for the euro area surprised to the upside, accelerating rather than slowing as a Reuters poll had expected.  read more

Growing nerves around a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections stalling European recovery at a time when central banks are planning the withdrawal of monetary support have also pulled investors out of equities.

When advance prints of Purchasing managers' Indexes (PMI) land, focus will be on businesses' input cost increases and whether they show signs of easing.
The readings may also reinforce the gap between robust U.S.  activity and COVID-plagued Europe, potentially further depressing the euro, which plumbed new 16-month lows on Monday .

October PMIs showed bloc's activity slowing the weakest in six months, while businesses' costs rose at the fastest pace in two decades.

The reading for the services sector beat a forecast for 56.0 points, and moved the index further above the 50-point threshold which marks an expansion in activity.
The flash PMI for the French manufacturing sector in November rose to 54.6 points, from 53.6 in October, also beating a forecast for 53.0 points.
The flash composite PMI index for November, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 56.3 points from 54.7 in October, beating a forecast for 53.6 points.
France's services industries benefited from new client contracts and higher workloads from existing customers, added IHS Markit, although supply-chain disruptions persisted.
""Having embarked on a clear period of slowing growth in the months leading up to October, the flash PMI data for November showed a fresh acceleration in French economic expansion,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""However, the driving force behind improvements in the data is services. Manufacturers are still struggling with component shortages, long lead times and subdued demand conditions,"" added Hayes.",0

Any potential deal is conditional on R&M completing the planned sale of its pensions business, Solutions, R&M added.
Asset managers, which actively manage funds, have been bulking up in recent years to cut costs and fight off competition from rivals running cheaper passive, or index-tracking, funds.
Premier Miton's merger interest in R&M was first reported by Sky News.
R&M announced a deal last month to sell its pensions business to Schroders (SDR.L) for 230 million pounds ($316.30 million) to sharpen its focus on its primary wealth management business, which manages 3.4 billion pounds in assets.

485,"JERUSALEM, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Iran is five years away from developing a nuclear weapon, and international talks due to restart next week will do nothing to slow it down, Israel said on Tuesday, adding it reserved the right to act to protect itself.
Indirect negotiationsto revive the 2015 accord, under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions, are due to resume in Vienna next Monday after a five-month pause.
Israel long opposed the nuclear deal, but Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's government, in power since June, had previously said it could be open to a new deal with tougher restrictions. In remarks on Tuesday to a security forum, however, he sounded less accomodating.
Bennett described Iran, which denies it is pursuing nuclear arms, as being at ""the most advanced stage"" of a nuclear weapons programme.
""In any event, even if there is a return to a deal, Israel is of course not a party to the deal and Israel is not obligated by the deal,"" he told the conference, hosted by Reichman University.
Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman said: ""With or without an agreement, Iran will be a nuclear state and have a nuclear weapon within five years, tops.""
Israel, itself widely believed to have nuclear weapons, has long argued that the 2015 deal was too weak to prevent Iran from pursuing a bomb. Former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, describing it as too soft, and Iran responded by violating some of the deal's restrictions. President Joe Biden's administration aims to revive it.
Israel has also complained that the nuclear agreement does nothing to rein in Iran's missile programme, or hostile activity by Iranian-backed militia.
""The Iranians have encircled the State of Israel with missiles while they sit safely in Tehran,"" Bennett said. ""To chase the terrorist du jour sent by the (Iranian covert) Qods Force does not pay off anymore. We must go for the dispatcher.""

The central bank will deepen interest rate reforms and improve rate transmission to further lower financing costs, Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), told a briefing.
His comments come a day after Premier Li Keqiang said authorities needed to avoid a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to shoring up economic growth.

The government will closely monitor their production and operations, study policy options, and will turn phased preferential policies into long-term policies, Xu said.

494,"CANBERRA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's legislative agenda came under risk on Tuesday after a conservative lawmaker in his coalition government threatened to withhold support if the government does not abolish mandatory COVID-19 vaccine rules.
Australia's two largest states, New South Wales and Victoria, have banned unvaccinated people from entering places such as restaurants and shops, citing a threat to public safety, while also requiring that they work from home.
George Christensen - a backbench lawmaker from the junior National party - threatened to abstain from voting on government legislation in the House of Representatives unless those rules are scrapped.
Morrison's government has a single vote majority in Australia's lower house. Without Christensen's vote, Morrison would have to rely on opposition support to pass legislation into law.
The prime minister is hoping to pass several pieces of key legislation in the final sitting period of the year in a bid to improve his standing in the polls ahead of an election that must be held by May 2022.
""Until federal action is taken against vaccine discrimination, I will be voting according to my conscience, or abstaining from votes ... rather than just voting with the government,"" Christensen said in a statement.
While Morrison has said he opposes mandatory vaccination orders, except for health workers, he has not usurped state leaders on the issue.
More than 80% of Australians over the age of 16 have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, while in many parts of the country, nearly all adults have opted for inoculation.

The overnight news on Powell buffeted financial markets and boosted the U.S. dollar and treasury yields, as traders prepared for the imminent end to the Fed's large scale coronavirus-led emergency Fed bond-buying programme.
The regional currencies also weakened, with Thai baht , one of the worst performing currencies in the region this year, falling 0.8% to hit a two-week low. The South Korean won  and Malaysian ringgit  fell 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
""Except for CNY, most currencies, including those in EM Asia, cowered under a stronger USD from higher US Treasury yields and the sell-off in S&P and Nasdaq,"" said Philip Wee, FX strategist at DBS.
Riskier assets in emerging markets have also come under selling pressure over recent sessions amid surging COVID-19 cases in Europe and renewed curbs, dousing investor hopes of a quicker economic recovery.
Stocks in Manila (.PSI), however, outperformed to close 1.6% higher, recouping previous week's losses. The peso  also bucked the broader trend to edge higher.
""Negative market sentiment across our Asian neighbours was mostly fuelled by growing concerns over tighter monetary policies in a bid to stem inflation,"" said Corenne Agravio, Senior Equity Analyst at Regina Capital Development Corp in Manila.
""However, the BSP has reaffirmed its stance on keeping rates steady, which buoyed investor sentiment,"" she said, referring to the Philippine central bank.
Sentiment was also buoyed by a steady decline in COVID-19 cases in Philippines since mid-September. The country logged 984 new COVID-19 cases on Monday.
Shares in Taiwan (.TWII), Indonesia (.JKSE) and South Korea (.KS11) were down between 0.5% and 0.8%.
Stocks in India (.NSEI) fell as much as 1.2% in early trade, before reversing course to trade 0.1% higher.
Singapore's key inflation price gauge rose by the fastest pace in nearly three years in October, mainly driven by higher services and food inflation. The city state's shares (.STI) were down 0.2%, while its dollar  also weakened.  read more

501,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand open their World Test Championship defence against India this week with an air of fatigue after a long road trip and the emotional letdown of the T20 World Cup.
Whitewashed 3-0 by India in a T20 series on the heels of their World Cup final defeat by Australia, the 'Black Caps' have lost that winning feeling as they head into the first test in Kanpur on Thursday against an opponent bent on revenge.
New Zealand may have golden memories of beating India in Southampton to claim the inaugural WTC trophy in June but the neutral territory of the Rose Bowl can hardly seem further away.
Without pace spearhead Trent Boult and all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme, New Zealand will face the same opponents where they have never won a test series let alone a test since the 1988/89 tour.
""You realise the enormity of the challenge ahead,"" head coach Gary Stead told reporters on Tuesday.
""India are a fantastic side. They’ve got world class spinners in their environment here as well.
""(They are) one of the great challenges on the test calendar. It’s something we haven’t done for a while, we haven't been here since 2016 but we’re certainly looking forward to what's ahead.""
New Zealand will have only two training sessions as a full squad before Thursday, with the T20 players having rejoined the camp on Monday following the defeat in Kolkata.  read more 
A number of players are well short of match fitness, including batsman Ross Taylor and paceman Neil Wagner.
Selectors have yet to decide who will replace batsman Devon Conway for the first test after he broke his hand punching his bat at the World Cup.
""We’re as prepared as we can be in this COVID world,"" said Stead.
""India are also coming off a T20 series ... Hopefully for us they are in a similar boat to what we are as well.""
New Zealand's four-prong pace attack reigned supreme in the last COVID-affected WTC cycle but the Black Caps will be unable to fall back on their traditional strengths in Kanpur and Mumbai.
They will hope left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel and offspinner Will Somerville can pressure India's powerful batting lineup, with all-rounder Mitch Santner also likely to be on hand with left-arm spin.
Stead acknowledged New Zealand would need to manage some players carefully after their long stint on the road but said there was little time to dwell on things.
""In two weeks we’ll be on a plane home, things will happen really quickly for us,"" he said. ""So it’s really important that we get focused on the job and the challenge that’s in front of us.""",0

Shares in the world's largest catering company reversed early losses to trade up 3% following the comments from Chief Executive Dominic Blakemore on an earnings call.
""The pipeline is exceptional ... we've got the digital and climate offers to win with the balance sheet to exploit all of these opportunities,"" Blakemore said in a call with analysts after the group reported better-than-expected annual profit and resumed dividend payments.
Compass guided to an underlying operating margin of more than 6% for fiscal 2022, just below average analysts' forecast of 6.5%. The outlook had sent shares falling 2.5% in early trade.
Food catering volumes picked up from pandemic lows, as students returned to universities and schools, sports fans filled stadiums and crowds attended events again. Fourth-quarter revenue recovered to 88% of 2019 levels.
The company said it would return to pre-pandemic margins of about 7% by the end of the fiscal 2022 year, although revenue and volumes would not exceed 2019 on a full-year basis until 2023.
""All in, we would say this is a solid print with the most positive message on how they will exit 2022,"" Bernstein analyst Richard Clarke said.
Blakemore said the group was varying menu choices and substituting products experiencing high levels of inflation to mitigate some pressures.
""We are seeing a trend towards local sourcing in many of our markets because of the disruptions in supply chain,"" he told Reuters.
Net new business wins totalled a record 2.1 billion pounds, around half of which were from companies outsourcing for the first time to cut costs, it said.
Compass' underlying operating profit rose 55% to 811 million pounds ($1.1 billion), versus analysts' average view of 797 million pounds.

The move illustrates Orange's (ORAN.PA) strategy of being able to deliver 'convergent offers' in both broadband and mobile to customers in all European countries where it operates and follows a surge in interest in telecoms dealmaking.
The broader sector is seeing an increase in potential M&A, with KKR approaching Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) about what would be Europe's biggest ever private equity buyout.  read more 
Orange Belgium (OBEL.BR), its listed Belgian subsidiary, owns its cellular network but has costly contracts with rivals in order to offer broadband services on top of mobile contracts.
The planned purchase of 75% of VOO would give Orange control over the cable network in Belgium's French speaking Wallonia region and part of the Brussels area.
The exclusive talks with VOO's parent company Nethys are a blow to Orange Belgium's local rival Telenet (TNET.BR), which acknowledged it had not been selected to enter into talks.
""A potential acquisition of VOO by Orange Belgium could reshape the Belgian telco landscape making the former mobile-only operator a worthy adversary for the two leaders in the fixed and convergent market,"" KBC Securities said in a note to clients. 
The potential Belgian deal comes after Orange's seizing of a controlling stake in Telekom Romania Communications, Romania's second-biggest broadband operator, last year.

Khurram Parvez was arrested late on Monday by India's federal National Investigation Agency (NIA), an Indian official briefed on the situation told Reuters.
His residence and office were searched and a mobile phone, laptop and books seized, he added.
A spokesperson for the NIA confirmed Parvez's arrest on Tuesday.
He is being held under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, that allows for detention of up to six months without trial.
His lawyer, Parvez Imroz, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Mary Lawlor, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, called Parvez's arrest ""disturbing"".
""He's not a terrorist, he's a human rights defender,"" she said in a tweet.
Parvez, one of Kashmir's best known activists, is head of Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, a group of rights organisations working in the region.
He was arrested and detained on similar charges in 2016, after being prevented from boarding a flight to attend a UN human rights forum in Geneva. He was eventually released without being convicted of any crime.
The Muslim-majority Kashmir region has been the source of decades of tensions between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan.

509,"MELBOURNE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A Western Australian Indigenous group is in talks with Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) over obtaining a stake in its $12 billion Scarborough and Pluto LNG expansion to help secure the future of the local traditional owners, a senior Indigenous official told Reuters.
Woodside gave the final go-ahead on Monday for the biggest new gas project in Australia in a decade, alarming conservationists worried about the impact the project might have on one of the world's largest collections of ancient rock art on adjacent Indigenous land.
The Murujuga Aboriginal Corp (MAC) and its traditional owners have long worked with Woodside, as its Pluto LNG plant is  on Murujuga country on the Burrup Peninsula.
MAC and other traditional owners do not receive royalties from businesses in the Burrup as rights to part of their land were acquired in 2002 to create an industrial development area, leaving MAC instead with the title to Murujuga National Park next to the industrial land.
Now MAC is seeking to secure a stake in the Scarborough project and Pluto LNG expansion, MAC Chief Executive Peter Jeffries told Reuters.
""Yes, we are proposing this,"" he said in response to a written question on whether MAC was in discussions to acquire a stake in the Scarborough and/or the Pluto LNG project.
""This is an integral element for development on (Murujuga) country as it helps us find ways to work together, to keep us involved, and to help create long term sustainability and stability for our members and future generations,"" Jeffries said. ""We want to be strategically vested in any project on country.""
MAC did not disclose the size or value of the stake sought, or any further details.
Woodside Chief Executive Meg O'Neill said the company is in talks with MAC and two other traditional owner groups, but declined to say what was being discussed.
""I'm not going to talk about any specific conversations that we're having with any TO (traditional owner) group,"" O'Neill told Reuters. ""Suffice it to say that we've got very active engagements with all three of those groups.""
HERITAGE CONCERNS
Woodside's huge new project will be built just as UNESCO considers a World Heritage listing for the Murujuga cultural landscape, which holds more than a million rock carvings, some more than 40,000 years old.
Indigenous heritage protection has become a major focus since miner Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L)legally destroyed culturally significant rock shelters for a Western Australian iron ore mine 18 months ago, sparking investor and public outrage.
Green groups are concerned about LNG plant emissions accelerating the degradation of the ancient rock art and are campaigning either to stop the project or press regulators to tighten emissions curbs on the plant.
The state is running a rock art monitoring programme with results due in 2024.
""In our mind the risk of accelerated aging is very low,"" O'Neill said.
Jeffries said MAC is in talks with both industry and the government to ensure conditions are in place to limit emissions and protect Murujuga country. It will await the results of the state's monitoring programme to determine the impact of emissions on rock art and how to respond.
""We hold all proponents to a high standard to ensure that their developments consider any potential impact to cultural heritage,"" he said.
In research available online and due to be published in 2022, a team led by Ben Smith at the University of Western Australia found that evidence suggests that the rock art has already been corroded by industrial pollution.",0

Myanmar has been in bloody turmoil since the military's Feb. 1 coup and movements that have sprang up to challenge the junta have been mainly supported by public donations.
The National Unity Government (NUG), an alliance of pro-democracy groups, ethnic minority armies and remnants of the ousted civilian government, said bonds went on sale on Monday to mainly Myanmar nationals overseas in denominations of $100, $500, $1,000 and $5,000, with two-year tenures.
Even though the bonds will generate no interest income for buyers, $3 million worth were sold in the first three hours, the NUG said, increasing to $6.3 million by the end of the day. Its overall target is $1 billion.
""From this, I witness the enthusiasm of people in the case of uprooting the fascist military,"" NUG spokesman, Dr. Sasa, said on Facebook.
The junta has outlawed the NUG and designated it a ""terrorist"" movement.
The NUG has not disclosed how the funds would be used.
A spokesperson for the junta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Opposition groups have been trying to stifle the military's efforts to consolidate power by encouraging people not to pay taxes and to join protests, a civil disobedience campaign and boycotts of army-linked businesses and a national lottery.
Buyers of the bonds made payments via international transfers to an account in the Czech Republic, the NUG said.
A 27-year-old Myanmar citizen, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said she invested $500 in the bonds.
""We do not expect to get money back after two years. We are buying it because we want to contribute to the revolution,"" she said.",0

Kaisa, which has the most offshore debt of any Chinese developer after China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), has not paid coupons totalling over $59 million due on Nov. 11 and 12, with 30-day grace periods for both.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Tuesday that an ad hoc group of offshore bondholders is also seeking advice from lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis, besides Moelis.
Kaisa has been scrambling to raise capital by divesting some of its assets including some land developments and the Hong Kong-listed property management unit (2168.HK). Reuters reported last month that Kaisa was seeking buyers for two residential sites in Hong Kong.  read more 
A separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said Kaisa recently sold the Hong Kong land parcel in Tuen Mun for HK$3.78 billion ($485.09 million) to local investor Francis Choi, a friend of Kaisa's chairman Kwok Ying Shing.
After repaying the loans for the land which Kaisa bought for HK$3.5 billion early last year, the Chinese developer will be able to book a profit of HK$1.3 billion, the source said.
CITIC and Bank of East Asia will provide a total of HK$4 billion financing to Choi, while Huatai Financial will lead a $150 million mezzanine loan.
Kaisa and Moelis declined to comment. There was no immediate comment from Kirkland & Ellis to a Reuters query sent outside U.S. working hours. Choi could not be reached for comment.
The Shenzhen-based developer, which was downgraded by Fitch last week to ""C"" from ""CCC-"" on the missed coupon payments, has another big test coming up - a $400 million maturity on a 6.5% dollar bond due on Dec. 7.
Kaisa has also missed some payments on its wealth management products onshore, and this month it pleaded for help from creditors and said it will not pay interim dividends.
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to regulatory curbs on borrowings, causing a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades and sell-offs in some developers' shares and bonds in recent months.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer which is at the centre of the crisis, has been stumbling from debt-repayment deadline to deadline as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities. Moelis and Kirkland & Ellis are advising a group of offshore bond holders of Evergrande.  read more

The London market pointed to a softer opening with FTSE futures off 0.21%, while E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index stayed flat. 
MSCI's gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell 0.52%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slid 1%.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 outperformed, closing up 0.79%, boosted by miners and energy stocks. Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday.
President Biden on Monday tapped Powell to continue as Fed chair, and Lael Brainard, the other top candidate for the job, as vice chair. The news initially buoyed Wall Street stocks, before the market pulled back into the afternoon with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closing down from all-time highs. The dollar attracted solid support. 
Riskier assets have been shaken up again over recent sessions amid surging COVID-19 cases in Europe and renewed curbs, dousing investor hopes of a quicker recovery in consumption and growth worldwide.
Germany’s outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel said the latest surge is the worst experienced by the country so far, while Austria went into a fresh lockdown on Monday.
Powell's current term, which has seen an emphasis on creating jobs from the prominent focus on inflation, has proven positive for risk assets, with the S&P gaining 69.7% since his appointment. 
""The USD looks poised to hold onto its gains post-Powell renomination as it leaves room for markets to flirt with the idea of a faster taper,"" said analysts at TD Securities in a note.
The U.S. rates chatter kept the dollar index well supported near a 16-month peak. The greenback was also near a 4-1/2-year top versus the yen in early deals on Tuesday. 
U.S. Treasury yields were led higher by two-year notes, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations. It hit its highest level since early March 2020.

In commodities, spot gold rose 0.19% to $1,808.4 per ounce, paring Monday's losses. Gold prices were under pressure as Powell's nomination drove expectations that the central bank will stay the course on tapering economic support. 
Oil prices were in the red again after a short rebound the previous day from recent losses on reports that OPEC+ could adjust plans to raise oil production if large consuming countries release crude from their reserves or if the coronavirus pandemic dampens demand. 
Brent crude was down 0.49% at $79.31 a barrel and U.S. crude <CLc1> dropped 0.7% to $76.21 per barrel by 0521GMT.

518,"HONG KONG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a new four-and-a-half-year top against the yen on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was renominated for a second term, reinforcing bets that U.S. interest rates would rise next year and diverge from Japan's.
The greenback rose as much as 0.24% to 115.13 yen , its highest since March 2017, having jumped 0.77% on Monday.
""We expect the weak JPY narrative to continue finding support amid attention to monetary policy divergence,"" Barclays analysts said in a note.
They said 115.5, the dollar's March 2017 high, would be one key level to watch, when it came to dollar gains, and, ""above that, we caution that there is no clear resistance until 118.7 (the end-2016 high).""
The Japanese currency is sensitive to moves in U.S. Treasury notes, and two-year  U.S. Treasury yields rose 8.5 basis points on Monday to their highest since early March 2020. They last yielded 0.5924%, little changed in Asian hours.
U.S. President Joe Biden chose Powell over the other leading candidate Lael Brainard, whom markets consider to be the more dovish of the two, though Brainard will be Fed vice chair.  read more 
The news reinforced market expectations of rate rises next year when the central bank finishes tapering its emergency bond buying programme.
Currency markets have been mostly driven by market perceptions of the different paces at which global central banks reduce pandemic era stimulus and raise rates.

The euro  languished at $1.136, around a 16-month low, having lost 2.8% so far this month.
The common currency has been hurt by the dovish tone from the European Central Bank and more recently a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in Europe, which forced Austria back into a full lockdown on Monday and caused Germany to consider tighter restrictions.  read more

521,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Investors are betting that newly renominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will need to step up the pace at which the central bank is normalizing monetary policy to better grapple with surging consumer prices.
For months, Powell has insisted the current bout of inflation is likely to be transitory, and said the central bank will be ""patient"" in deciding when to begin raising its benchmark rate from near-zero. The Fed kicked off the taper of its $120 billion per month bond buying program in November, with a plan to end purchases altogether in mid-2022.  read more 
Some investors, however, believe the Fed will need to taper faster and raise rates sooner than expected to tame rising consumer prices, which grew at the quickest pace in more than three decades in October. Their view has been reinforced by recent public debate among some Fed officials on whether to withdraw support for the economy more quickly to help tame inflation.  read more 
One barometer of investors’ monetary policy expectations, futures on the federal funds rate, on Monday afternoon had priced in a 100% chance that the central bank will raise rates by July, from 92% last week.
News of Powell’s nomination on Monday also sent yields on shorter-dated Treasuries, which are more sensitive to rate views, to their highest level since early 2020. Powell is widely seen as more hawkish than Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who was also vying for the top job.  read more 
Investors are ""challenging the Fed to some extent and becoming more concerned about the Fed falling behind the curve on inflation,"" said Mike Sewell, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.
Sewell is buying shorter-dated Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, betting that the Fed will need to raise rates three times next year to tame inflation. The central bank’s dot-plot, released in September, showed half of policymakers penciling in one rate increase next year.
Analysts at Jefferies wrote Monday’s rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, “is predicated on the idea that the prospects for a June 2022 rate hike have increased significantly on the back of Powell's renomination,” though the bank believes a June rate increase is unlikely.
Bets on shorter-dated Treasuries have also drawn Gary Cloud, a portfolio manager of the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund.
""We're in an era that investors haven't seen before because you have a significant uncertainty as to whether the Fed will act in time"" to prevent inflation from spiraling higher, he said.
Diverging views on how aggressively the Fed will move have helped stir volatility in Treasury markets. The ICE Bank of America MOVE Index (.MOVE), which shows expectations of volatility in the bond market, stands near its highest levels since April 2020.
Inflation expectations edged lower on Monday, with 5- and 10-year breakeven inflation rates dipping to their lowest in about two weeks.
Meanwhile, calls for the Fed to normalize monetary policy more aggressively are now coming from some of the central bank’s own policymakers, reinforcing many investors’ views.
Vice Chair Richard Clarida said earlier this month that “a discussion about increasing the pace at which we are reducing our balance sheet” would be something to consider for the Fed's next meeting, while Fed Governor Christopher Waller called for the Fed to double up on its wind-down of bond purchases, finishing by April 2022 to make way for a possible interest-rate hike in the second quarter.  read more 
Powell, for his part, has said inflation will likely abate as supply chain bottlenecks that have contributed to higher prices eventually ease. There have been some indications that the worst of those disruptions are clearing up, with cargo shipping costs down by a third over the last month and prices for commodities such as iron ore and lumber tumbling.
Others, however, insist inflation is headed higher. Adam Abbas, a portfolio manager and co-head of fixed income at Harris Associates, is buying the bonds of companies such as hotels, which may be able to better deflect the effects of higher inflation by raising prices.
Donald Ellenberger, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, expects bond market volatility to persist as inflation proves ""stickier"" than the Fed expected. He plans to focus on shorter-duration Treasuries until the 10-year note rises to 2.5% or higher, a level he sees as appropriate given inflation.
""For many years the Treasury market was pretty sleepy and rates didn’t move very much,” he said. “Now the market doesn't know what to do when faced with the fact that inflation is persisting for longer than expected.”",0
522,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden ended months of speculation over his pick to run the Federal Reserve in reappointing Jerome Powell as chair and promoting Fed Governor Lael Brainard to the bank's No. 2 role.  read more 
The announcement kicks off an approval process in the U.S. Senate that could wrap up as early as next month or stretch into early 2022. Powell's current term as chair expires in early February, and the Fed Board of Governors seat held by Richard Clarida, who currently holds the vice chair post to which Brainard has been nominated, expires at the end of January.
In the meantime, the Fed continues about its business, with its final policy meeting of the year in three weeks. Here's what's ahead for the leadership process and the Fed's agenda:
FIRST STOP: SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE
The nominations of Powell and Brainard, whose stints as Fed board members date to 2012 and 2014, respectively, must be formally submitted to the Senate, which will refer them to the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Democrat Sherrod Brown.
The committee, split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, will schedule confirmation hearings and then vote to either report the nominees favorably, unfavorably or with no recommendation to the full Senate.
Fed officials including Powell and Brainard enter a ""blackout period"" starting at the end of next week ahead of their December 14-15 policy meeting, making it unlikely their confirmation hearing or committee vote could be held before then.
ON TO THE FULL SENATE
Regardless of the committee's recommendation, the full 100-member chamber, also equally divided, then has the final say, with Vice President Kamala Harris designated as the tie-breaking vote should it come to that.
Both have been through this process before for their current posts. While neither received unanimous support in their previous nominations, both were ultimately approved.
Powell, a Republican who has focused extensively on his relations with Congress since becoming chair in 2018, is seen getting majority support from both parties. Brainard, a Democrat, may find less bi-partisan backing, but at least one Republican - Susan Collins of Maine - told Reuters she would back both. 
Broker-dealer BTIG in a note on Monday said it expects the process to move quickly in December, starting promptly after the Fed's next meeting.
""Our base case is that they will be cleared by the full Senate this year,"" BTIG analyst Isaac Boltansky said.
THREE MORE SPOTS
Biden still has three vacancies to fill at the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, including the vice chair for supervision role recently vacated by Randal Quarles, who leaves the Fed at the end of the year.
These openings offer Biden an opportunity to put a lasting imprint on the central bank, and most analysts expect him to tap progressives and individuals of diverse backgrounds, especially for the bank-oversight role.
Progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, upset with Biden's choice of Powell, have ramped up calls for a tougher Wall Street cop in the supervision seat.
Biden said in his statement nominating Powell and Brainard that he would announce his choices for these roles in early December. Each will go through the same process detailed above.
A 'DIFFICULT DANCE'
As the Powell and Brainard nominations weave their way through Capitol Hill, business at the Fed continues, with the year's final policy meeting in just three weeks' time and growing expectations for more decisive action to address annual inflation running at around twice the bank's 2%-a-year target.
Earlier this month, officials took the first step toward putting policy on a more normal track after roughly a year-and-a-half in an emergency footing designed to cushion the economy from the broadside delivered by the pandemic.
A number of Fed officials argue they need to accelerate that end-game process to bring inflation to heel - starting with a quicker end to their bond purchases and an earlier start to rate hikes.
Just how far Powell and Brainard are leaning in that direction is unclear, but both went out of their way on Monday as they stood alongside Biden to assure they are determined not to allow inflation to upend the ongoing economic recovery and hurt American families.  read more 
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, sees a challenging few months ahead for the Fed, with almost as much uncertainty about the pandemic - and the risks that poses to the recovery - as about inflation.
""They have to raise rates quickly enough and take their foot off the accelerator fast enough that the economy doesn't experience runaway asset markets or inflation that's going to be tough to get back into something they feel comfortable with,"" Zandi said. ""It's a very difficult dance they're going to have to do.""",0

526,"SHANGHAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's yuan inched higher on Tuesday, as continued seasonal corporate demand for the local unit outweighed broad dollar strength and a weaker-than-expected official yuan guidance rate.
Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate  at 6.3929 per dollar, 23 pips firmer than the previous fix of 6.3952.
The higher yuan comes even as the dollar was supported by U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to reappoint Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second term, emboldening bets of higher U.S. interest rates.  read more 
Although the PBOC lifted the official yuan midpoint rate higher, the official guidance was 69 pips softer than a Reuters estimate of 6.3860 per dollar.
Some market analysts and traders said the weaker-than-expected fixings over the past week suggest authorities may have started to get slightly uncomfortable with the recent yuan rally.
Ming Ming, head of fixed income research at CITIC Securities, said the yuan was likely to stay strong and resilient in the short-term on corporate demand. Chinese companies traditionally have greater demand for the yuan for various payments in the last two months of the year.
Indeed, traders said they kept receiving queries from their corporate clients to convert their dollar receipts into the yuan, and that this could persist until the end of 2021.
Market sentiment was also underpinned by a Reuters report that some Chinese banks had been told by financial regulators to issue more loans to property firms for project development, in efforts to marginally ease liquidity strains across the  industry.  read more 
In the spot market, the onshore yuan  opened at 6.3852 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.3851 at midday, 9 pips firmer than the previous late session close.
By midday, the broad dollar index  rose to 96.529 from the previous close of 96.467, when the offshore yuan  was trading at 6.3864 per dollar.
But market analysts expected some downard pressure over the longer term.
""In the long run, higher expectations for other economies to gradually raise interest rates next year and the expected falls in China's export growth may put the yuan under pressure,"" Ming said.
Zhang Yu, chief analyst at Huachuang Securities, said the long stretch of yuan strength ""may be drawing to an end"", with monetary policy and economic growth in China and the United States set to diverge in 2022.
While the Fed is expected to hike interest rates late next year, markets believe the Chinese central bank still has an easing bias in its policy stance to prop up the economy.

The Biden administration asked a federal appeals court on Tuesday to lift a court-ordered stay on a sweeping workplace COVID-19 vaccine rule to avoid serious harm to public health, or alternatively to allow a masking-and-testing requirement.
The administration said in its filing that if the ruling remained, it should at least be modified to allow the masking-and-testing requirement. A modified stay would also shield employers from state and local laws banning vaccine and mask mandates, the administration said.  read more 
Total deaths in Europe could exceed 2.2 million by March
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday a further 700,000 people could die from COVID-19 in Europe by March, taking the total to above 2.2 million, as it urged people to get vaccinated and to have booster shots. COVID-19 is now the top regional cause of death.
Total cumulative deaths from the respiratory disease in the 53 countries of the WHO's European region have already surpassed 1.5 million, it said, with the daily rate doubling from late September to 4,200 a day. The WHO's European region also includes Russia and other former Soviet republics as well as Turkey.  read more 
Fauci says vast majority of vaccinated Americans should get a booster
Top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday the vast majority of Americans who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 should receive a booster shot, and that an additional dose could eventually become the country's standard for determining who is fully vaccinated. To date, about 33 million Americans have received a booster dose.
As for the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, which started with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine earlier this month, Fauci said there is no sign of any new safety issues. ""There is no signal at all,"" Fauci said.  read more 
South Korea reports daily record of new COVID-19 infections
South Korea reported a new daily record of 4,116 coronavirus cases for Tuesday, as the country battles to contain a spike in serious cases requiring hospitalisation, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum called on health authorities to classify the patients accordingly based on the severity of the symptoms and make use of self-treatment options for mild or asymptomatic cases. Less than 20% were treating themselves at home last week, Kim said. Despite the increase in hospitalisation rate, the country's mortality rate remains relatively low at 0.79%.  read more 
New Zealand to reopen to foreign travellers from April 30
New Zealand will keep its borders closed to most international travellers for a further five months, the government said on Wednesday, outlining a cautious easing of border curbs that have been in place since COVID-19 hit in March 2020. Fully vaccinated international travellers will be allowed to enter the country from April 30, 2022 onwards, with the re-opening staged over time, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins told a news conference.
Fully vaccinated New Zealanders and residence visa holders in neighbouring Australia can travel to New Zealand from Jan. 16, while vaccinated New Zealanders and residence visa holders most from other countries will be allowed in from Feb. 13. Travellers will no longer be required to stay at state quarantine facilities, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said.  read more ",0
529,"NEW DELHI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - India reported 7,579 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, the smallest rise in one-and-a-half-years despite huge festival gatherings in recent weeks, thanks to rising vaccinations and antibodies from prior infections.
The country of 1.35 billion celebrated Durga Puja in October and Diwali this month, during which millions of people shopped, travelled and met family, mostly without masks. Mask-wearing is nearly non-existent outside the big cities.
""Even after Diwali, we are not seeing a surge,"" said M.D. Gupte, a former director of the state-run National Institute of Epidemiology, attributing it mainly to the presence of antibodies in a huge majority of Indians through natural infection.
""I think we are much safer now.""
Government surveys have estimated that nearly 70% of Indians had been naturally infected by July, following a record rise in infections and deaths in April and May.
So far, 81% of India's 944 million adults have received at least one dose of vaccine and 43% have had two doses. Vaccination for people under 18 has not yet begun.  read more 
India has reported a total of 34.5 million COVID-19 cases, second only to the tally in the United States. India's COVID deaths rose by 236 in the past 24 hours to 466,147.

530,"NEW DELHI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Employees of India's Future Retail have asked the Supreme Court to allow the company to sell its retail assets and rule against Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in an ongoing dispute, citing risks to 27,000 jobs, according to a legal filing seen by Reuters.
Future has failed to close its $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets to market leader Reliance Industries (RELI.NS)  due to successful legal challenges by Amazon, which argues that Future violated some pre-existing contracts the two sides had struck, by deciding to sell its retail assets to Reliance.
As India's Supreme Court hears the dispute, a group of Future Retail (FRTL.NS) (FRL) employees have filed a petition urging the court to rule against Amazon, saying their livelihoods were at stake.
If the deal fails, Future ""will be pushed into liquidation, resulting in its 27,000 employees losing their livelihoods. The families of employees will be on the streets,"" the FRL Employee Welfare Association said in a Nov. 20 filing, seen by Reuters. The filing has not previously been reported and is not public.
Future, which denies any wrongdoing, has said it would face liquidation if the Reliance deal doesn't go through, while Amazon has repeatedly argued that its 2019 investment into a Future unit prohibits the Future-Reliance deal.
The employee's filing will likely be heard on Dec. 8, when the Supreme Court is next due to take up the matter.
The employee association also cited salary cuts in the range of 40-50% between April and July last year due to distress at Future, the country's second-largest retailer, whose businesses were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.",0

534,"CHICAGO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. winter wheat futures rose to nine-year highs on Tuesday as declining weekly U.S. crop condition ratings stoked supply concerns and sparked fresh buying that more than offset earlier profit-taking pressure.
Corn extended prior-session gains in light trading, while soybeans eased as traders squared positions ahead of this week's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
Concerns about inflation underpinned commodities markets in general.
Trading volumes in grains were lighter than normal as many market participants were absent amid an abbreviated trading schedule this week. Markets are closed on Thursday and will close early on Friday.
""The market gave back some of yesterday's gains in sort of a vacuum for news. Corn led us back up and wheat seemingly doesn't want to go down,"" said Ted Seifried, chief ag market strategist with Zaner Group.
Concerns about tightening global supplies have supported wheat prices as rains stalled harvesting in Australia and threatened grain quality. Flooding has also disrupted shipments from western Canada, while prices in Russia, the world's top wheat exporter, have climbed steadily.
Dry conditions in the U.S. winter wheat belt also fueled early worries about next year's harvest.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Monday that 44% of the U.S. winter wheat crop was in good-to-excellent condition, down from 46% a week earlier. Analysts on average had expected an unchanged score. 
Chicago Board of Trade March soft red winter wheat  was up 10 cents at $8.67-1/2 a bushel, the highest for a most-active contract  since December 2012. Most futures months hit contract highs.
K.C. hard red winter wheat futures also posted contract highs in nearly all months, with the March contract  17-1/2 cents higher at $8.84 a bushel.
December corn  gained 3-3/4 cents to $5.80-1/2 a bushel. January soybeans  fell 1-1/4 cents to $12.73 a bushel.",0
535,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Manchester United's caretaker manager Michael Carrick said he has limited time to make an impact in the role but is relishing the challenge ahead of Tuesday's Champions League group game at Villarreal.
United sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Sunday after a run of five defeats in seven Premier League games left them eighth.
Former United player Carrick, who was a member of Solskjaer's coaching staff, is in charge until the club appoint an interim manager to lead the side through to the end of the season.
""To see Ole lose his job was tough for me and a lot of people at the club,"" Carrick told British media on Monday.
""It was a bit of a rush then to organise training and speak to the players and carry out the day's work. It's a limited time, I'm well aware of that, but it's a challenge that I'm relishing at the moment.
""(Villarreal) is a big game for both teams at this stage of the competition, and we can't hide from that. But it's one to go out and enjoy.""

537,"JOHANNESBURG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - South Africa's Old Mutual (OMUJ.J) announced plans on Tuesday to expand its banking services and look at acquisitions, as the insurer positioned for recovery after a tough few years that have included absorbing higher-than-expected COVID-19 claims.
In addition to the pandemic, the group has had to manage a damaging dispute with its ex-CEO and trouble in some key units, especially elsewhere in Africa.
In a presentation to investors, Chief Executive Iain Williamson said efforts to win back ground lost to competitors, turn around some units and recover from the impact of COVID-19 were on track.
""Bearing in mind the residual uncertainty... it's going very well,"" he said.
Old Mutual plans to start offering credit to small- and medium-sized firms, is looking for small acquisitions to drive growth, and should have completed the turnaround of businesses in east and west Africa by 2023, executives said.
The insurer will also invest in building up its existing banking offering and broadening its target market, Williamson added.
Old Mutual also flagged on Tuesday that it had used a further 4.9 billion rand ($309 million) of its pandemic provisions.
It has already repeatedly had to increase its provisions after underestimating the level of death claims it would receive.
The company now has only 1 billion rand left in its reserve with cases starting to rise once more in South Africa, raising the prospect provisions could have to be hiked again.
The insurer said claims had been higher in part due to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy in South Africa, and that provisions would be assessed again at the end of the year.
South Africa is the worst-hit country on the continent, with 2.93 million recorded cases and 89,584 deaths. Despite high vaccine supplies, only 35% of adults are fully vaccinated.
Old Mutual is not alone in facing higher-than-expected claims. European insurers Swiss Re (SRENH.S), Aegon (AEGN.AS) and Munich Re also reported a worse-than-anticipated impact.
Its shares closed 1.62% lower on Tuesday.

538,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - India's participation in the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan is a ""challenging"" issue for the International Cricket Council but the world governing body said it is confident all teams will travel to the country for the tournament.
International sides have largely steered clear of Pakistan since an attack by Islamist militants on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in 2009 that killed six policemen and two civilians.
The 50-over tournament will be the first ICC event hosted by Pakistan since it shared the 1996 World Cup with India and Sri Lanka and last week's announcement came as a big boost after England and New Zealand pulled out of tours there in September.
Asked if the ICC was confident teams would travel to Pakistan, chairman Greg Barclay told reporters on Monday: ""From what we can see, absolutely.
""We wouldn't have awarded the event if we didn't think Pakistan was capable of hosting it.
""I'm sure, as with all countries, they will put together appropriate security plans to deliver the event. We're comfortable and confident it will go ahead.""
There were fears the decisions by New Zealand and England would again dampen the prospects of international cricket in Pakistan but Australia confirmed this month they would tour next year for the first time since 1998.
The prospects of India travelling to Pakistan for the first time since the 2008 Asia Cup remain unclear, however.
Anurag Thakur, India's sports minister and former cricket board chief, told reporters last week security was the main concern and that the government would make the call when the time comes.
India hosted Pakistan in a bilateral series in 2013 but the bitter neighbours rarely meet outside global tournaments these days. Pakistan played in India at the 2011 World Cup as well as the T20 World Cup in 2016.
""We know it's a challenging issue,"" Barclay said. ""From my point of view, I can't control geo-political forces.
""I just hope cricket can be a force to help improve relations between countries. One of the great things sports can do is to help bring nations together. If we can do something in a small way to contribute to that, that's fantastic.""",0

541,"CANBERRA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The government of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is deploying a ""dangerous election tactic"" with its comments about joining the United States in any war over Taiwan, the opposition party's foreign affairs spokesperson said on Tuesday.
Australia's Minister for Defence Peter Dutton earlier this month said it was ""inconceivable"" that Canberra would not join the United States in military action should China attack Taiwan, the democratically ruled island Beijing views as a wayward province.  read more 
Penny Wong, the foreign affairs spokesperson for the opposition Labor party, said Dutton's comments were part of the government's strategy for an election that must happen before May 2022.
""Amping up the prospect of war against a superpower is the most dangerous election tactic in Australian history – a tactic employed by irresponsible politicians who are desperate to hang on to power at any cost,"" Wong said in a speech to the Australian National University on Tuesday.
Wong said Morrison's government has in recent weeks sought to portray Labor as pro-China.
Relations with China, already rocky after Australia banned Huawei from its nascent 5G broadband networking in 2018, cooled further after Canberra in 2020 called for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, first reported in central China in 2019.
China responded by imposing tariffs on Australian commodities, including wine and barley and limited imports of Australian beef, coal and grapes, moves described by the United States as ""economic coercion"".
Wong said Taiwan is the greatest risk to stability in the Indo-Pacific region, and any conflict there would be ""catastrophic for humanity"".",0
542,"TAIPEI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan will respect the outcome of the Honduras election but the country should be aware of getting sucked in by China's ""false"" promises, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday ahead of a vote which could see Taipei lose a steadfast ally to Beijing.
Honduras is one of only 15 countries that still maintain formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan. The two have a relationship dating back to 1941, before the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war.
But poll leader Xiomara Castro, of the leftist opposition Libre Party, says she plans to open relations with China if elected, giving Beijing another foothold in what is traditionally the U.S. back yard.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told reporters that based on democratic principles they would respect the outcome of the election, but would also strengthen communication with all sides in Honduras including the opposition.
""We will continue to explain, and let them know, that only Taiwan is a partner worthy of trust for Honduras. At the same time we will remind Honduras to pay attention to China's flashy and false promises.""
Outgoing Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez visited Taiwan earlier this month and met Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, saying he hoped his country would continue its friendship with Taiwan.
China has been gradually whittling away at Taiwan's remaining allies, especially in its former stronghold of Central America, where Taiwan now only has official relations with Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Belize.
China's efforts have alarmed and angered Washington, which is concerned about Beijing's growing international influence.
Pacific island nations Kiribati and the Solomon Islands were the last countries to cut ties with Taipei in September 2019.
China views democratically ruled Taiwan as one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of a state.
Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name, and that Beijing has no right to speak for it.",0
543,"BEIJING, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's customs authorities said on Tuesday they will accept import applications for Brazilian beef that has been granted a sanitary certificate prior to Sept. 4, potentially allowing for cargoes of beef stuck at Chinese ports to finally clear customs.
Brazil had suspended exports of beef to China on Sept. 4 after detecting two cases of atypical mad cow disease but meat that was already at ports continued to be exported, with most of it unable to clear customs on arrival in China. 
Customs updated its website on Tuesday to say that it was now accepting import applications for beef certified prior to the suspension.
It was not immediately clear how long such procedures would take, or how much product has been stuck in limbo since the suspension.
Brazil is China's top supplier of beef, catering to about 40% of its imports, and buyers had initially expected the trade to resume within weeks.
Since the cases in cattle were announced, Brazil has also reported two cases of a neurodegenerative disorder in people, though agriculture officials said they were not related to beef consumption. ",0

A Sri Lankan court on Monday began the first of three trials connected to bombings that killed nearly 270 people on the island in 2019, amidst appeals for greater accountability from victim support groups.
In this trial, former national police chief Pujith Jayasundara is charged with failing to act on repeated intelligence warnings of a possible terror attack.
A total of 855 charges of murder and attempted murder were read out as Jayasundara stood in the dock at the back of the courtroom. A total of 1,215 witnesses have been listed to give evidence but not all may be called, his lawyer said.
""Our position is the former police chief is not guilty. He did not intentionally aid or abet the attacks and there was no omission on his part that caused the attacks,"" attorney Roshan Dehiwala told Reuters.
Ex-Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, the top official in the defence ministry at the time, faces similar charges in a trial beginning later on Monday. Neither he nor his lawyer could be reached for comment.
Both men are out on bail.
The trial of 24 men accused of carrying out the attacks begins on Tuesday.
Police filed over 23,000 charges against those suspects, including conspiring to murder, aiding and abetting the attacks, and collecting arms and ammunition. The group also includes Mohammad Naufer, who officials say masterminded the attacks and is linked to Islamic State.
The string of attacks carried out on 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday, targeted three churches and three hotels, killing 267 people, including at least 45 foreign nationals. The attacks, the worst in Sri Lanka’s turbulent history, also injured about 500 people, mostly belonging to the island’s minority Christian community.
On Sunday, dozens of Catholic community members held protests and laid flowers at multiple events organized to remember those lost in the attacks.
Participants appealed to the government to support survivors and ensure the trials are allowed to proceed without political interference.
""We want genuine justice from this process. That is what we are appealing for the officials to deliver. We have been waiting a long time and we want the real people responsible held accountable for what happened,"" said Eranga Gunasekera, a member of a victims support group, during a remembrance ceremony held in Colombo.",0
546,"SYDNEY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar fell to a near six-week low on Tuesday as its U.S. counterpart basked in the afterglow of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's renomination for a second term, with some betting a quicker track to the start of U.S. rate hikes.
The kiwi, which has been underpinned in recent weeks by the domestic impetus to tighten policy further, was down 0.3% to reach $0.6933 , the lowest since Oct 13.  read more 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is widely expected to follow up its October rate hike with another 25-basis-point increase at its review on Wednesday. Some analysts say a bigger 50-bps increase can't be ruled out given the threat posed by rising inflation.
Globally, central banks are grappling with the risks of intensifying price pressures and the need to carefully calibrate any rate increases lest they derail their economies.
U.S. President Joe Biden's renomination of Powell for a second term reinforced market expectations of rate rises next year, with some wagering on a quicker start to tightening once the Fed is done with tapering of its emergency bond-buying programme. read more 
The Aussie was little changed, hovering near recent lows at  $0.7230 on its U.S. peer, but was supported by higher prices in iron ore futures.

A larger hike or an aggressive forecast projection for its tightening cycle could push the kiwi above $0.7000, Speizer said, while a softer tone or a 25-basis-point move risks taking it below $0.6900.

548,"SYDNEY, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Cricket Tasmania chairman Andrew Gaggin condemned Cricket Australia's ""appalling"" treatment of Tim Paine on Tuesday, saying he should never have been put in a position where he felt he had to resign as Australia test captain.
Paine stood down from the role last Friday after sexually explicit text messages he sent to a female former colleague at Cricket Tasmania in 2017 were leaked to the media.  read more 
The 36-year-old wicketkeeper, who has represented Tasmania since the 2005/6 season, had been exonerated by a Cricket Australia integrity review into the matter soon after becoming test skipper in 2018.
""In conversations I have had in recent days it is clear that the anger amongst the Tasmania cricket community and general public is palpable,"" Gaggin said in a statement on Tuesday.
""Tim Paine has been a beacon for Australian cricket over the past four years and instrumental in salvaging the reputation of the national team after the calamity of Cape Town.
""The treatment afforded to the Australian test captain by Cricket Australia has been appalling, and the worst since Bill Lawry over 50 years ago.""
Lawry was notoriously sacked as Australia captain and dropped from the team ahead of the final test of the 1970-71 Ashes series, only discovering his fate when informed by reporters.
Cricket Tasmania said after Paine's resignation that the female former employee complained to them about the messages only after she had been charged with stealing from the organisation.
Cricket Australia chair Richard Freudenstein said on Saturday that the current leadership team would have sacked Paine had they been in charge in 2018. 
""At a time when CA should have supported Tim, he was evidently regarded as dispensable,"" Gaggin continued.
""The Cricket Tasmania board reaffirmed its view that Paine should not have been put in a position where he felt the need to resign over an incident that was determined by an independent inquiry at the time to not be a breach of the code of conduct and was a consensual and private exchange that occurred between two mature adults and was not repeated.""

Latent View, whose initial public offering (IPO) was oversubscribed more than 300 times, gained as much as 178.2% to 548 rupees after debuting at 512.20 rupees in pre-open trade, a 160% premium to the offer price of 197 rupees.
At the session high, the data analytics firm was valued at 108.40 billion rupees ($1.45 billion).
""The company's strength is that it operates in a niche segment but is relevant to businesses across sectors,"" said Narendra Solanki, head of equity research (fundamental) at Anand Rathi Investment Services.
The startup, whose strong financials and client base attracted investor interest, was founded in 2006 and provides a range of services including business analytics and data engineering services and counts the likes of Adobe (ADBE.O), Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and 7-Eleven among its clients.
""The focus of our work is towards solving the more complicated and higher-end problems that our clients face, and the pandemic has accelerated the need for companies to process data to find such solutions,"" Chief Executive Officer Rajan Sethuraman told Reuters on Monday.

""We are already cash-positive and internally feel confident that now is the right time (for an IPO),"" Sethuraman added.

551,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Nicaragua announced on Monday that it is lifting the visa requirement for Cuban nationals in a move which could make it easier for Cubans to migrate north toward the United States.
Nicaragua's Interior Ministry said in a statement it was immediately establishing a free visa for all Cuban citizens to promote commercial exchange, tourism and humanitarian family relations.
While Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has aligned himself with the Cuban government, its citizens previously needed visas to visit the Central American country.
In 2014, during the immigration crisis along the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the Ortega government prevented Cubans from passing through its territory, a move many analysts considered a favor to Washington.
But relations between Managua and Washington have deteriorated sharply. Earlier this month, the U.S. government said Nicaragua's recent elections, in which Ortega was re-elected for his fourth consecutive term, were ""illegitimate.""

553,"SINGAPORE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Indonesia's palm oil exports and production in 2021 are both likely to fall for a second straight year, the vice chairman of the country's palm oil association (GAPKI) said on Tuesday.
The expected decline at the world's top producer is due to a sharp drop of crude palm oil exports and output issues stemming from less fertiliser use and poor plantation upkeep.
Total palm oil exports are expected to fall for a second year by 0.34% in 2021 from a year earlier, GAPKI vice chairman Togar Sitanggang told a virtual conference.
Indonesia's crude palm oil (CPO) exports, meanwhile, are expected to plummet by 60.5% this year compared to 2020, he added, as top buyer India opts for refined products instead.
Sitanggang said the fall in exports overall were mainly due to the slump in CPO shipments.
""India somehow prefers refined palm oil,"" he said, adding that export of refined palm oil products are seen up 22.2% for this year.
This is the second time GAPKI has revised their export outlook for 2021.
The association forecasted last month that 2021 total palm oil exports would rise 1.2%, despite a then-estimated drop in CPO exports of 54.4%. 
Sitanggang said that the drop in CPO exports is in line with the country's goal to cease CPO exports altogether, while beefing up shipments of value-added palm oil.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo said last month that he country aims to stop exporting CPO ""at some point"" in the future.
Indonesia has not yet disclosed details on how it would stop CPO exports. 
Palm oil exports fell 9% in 2020 after hitting a record high in 2019, while production fell 1%. ",0

Benchmark copper  on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was marginally lower at $9,726 per tonne by 1730 GMT, snapping a three-session winning streak.
The dollar index against a basket of currencies  hit a fresh 16-month high. A stronger dollar makes commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.

556,"MELBOURNE, Nov 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Xing Jin wants to put the plastic-surgery app he co-founded and runs under the financial knife. On Monday he offered to buy the 84% he doesn’t own of So-Young (SY.O) which matches online users with providers of so-called medical-aesthetic services. There may well be good reasons for shareholders to accept his deal valuing the company at $556 million. But it will aggravate the existing angry governance scar of supervoting stock.
That mark was put in place when So-Young went public in New York two-and-a-half years ago. After a brief pop, shares have since fallen like a bad face or buttock lift. Prior to the take-private proposal, the company was sagging 79% from its peak valuation. It wasn’t helped by news over the summer that the Chinese government is looking to curb the industry’s proclivity for overstating  the benefits of its services.
On the face of it, some shareholders may well be tempted by the 22% premium Xing is offering to Friday’s closing price. Others, though, may still be focused on a longer-term view. The market for medical-aesthetics procedures is expected to double to $43 billion a year between 2020 and 2025, according to Frost & Sullivan. And So-Young’s third-quarter earnings, unveiled on Friday, showed a 20% jump in revenue.
Independent investors’ views, though, are likely to be all but irrelevant. The class-B shares Xing owns transform his 16.4% ownership of common shares into control of more than 84% of the vote. That means he can get his financial procedure done and dusted without their say – unless he takes the unusual step of excluding his supervoting stock from the ballot. Anyone complaining about the operation must face up to an ugly reality: If you give someone all the power, you can’t cry foul when they use it.

558,"MELBOURNE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - While Tim Paine will no longer lead his team out as Australia captain in the wake of a 'sexting' scandal, selectors have yet to decide whether he will take the field at all during the Ashes.
Being captain was the one thing that guaranteed the 36-year-old selection and he now faces a challenge to prove he deserves a spot behind the stumps.
Paine is the only specialist wicketkeeper in Australia's 15-man squad to face England but selector George Bailey confirmed he is no lock for the first Ashes test starting in Brisbane on Dec. 8.
Paine, who has not played a first-class match since April, only made his return to competitive cricket from neck surgery on Monday, turning out for Tasmania's second XI against a South Australia side in Hobart.
As fellow Tasmanian Bailey looked on, Paine took six catches and moved well behind the stumps.
Bailey, however, said he would recuse himself from a vote on  picking Paine, a friend and business partner, if there was no consensus on the selectors' panel.
""If the panel was not in agreeance on Tim's position going forward, and it was going to come down to a vote, then I would step aside and leave that to Tony (Dodemaide) and Justin (Langer) to work through,"" Bailey told the Cricket Etc podcast.
""They're both aware of that.""
The panel will be expected to consider Paine's match fitness along with his glovework and batting when weighing candidates.
Paine was dismissed lbw for one batting for Tasmania's second XI on Tuesday in a minor setback.
He is regarded one of the country's top keepers, though his glovework came under heavy scrutiny during the India series early this year when he dropped three catches on day five of the drawn third test in Sydney, helping the tourists avert a potentially decisive defeat.
While lacking a test century, Paine has a solid batting average of 32.63 from his 35 tests, which compares favourably with past Australia wicketkeepers Brad Haddin (32.98 from 66 tests) and Ian Healy (27.39 from 119 tests).
His main rivals include Alex Carey, who Paine beat out for the position when recalled for the 2017/18 Ashes, and another uncapped player in Western Australian Josh Inglis.
White ball specialist Carey boasts a marginally better first class batting average of 35.66 versus Paine's 30.16.
Inglis, named in the Australia 'A' squad with Carey, is also seen as a potential test prospect after racking up 585 runs, including three centuries, in the last Sheffield Shield season.
Neither Carey nor Inglis have scored many runs in recent domestic matches, so the door may be ajar for a dark horse like Queensland wicketkeeper Jimmy Peirson.
Peirson's glovework is rated exemplary and he is averaging 53 in the Shield season to date, though his omission from the Australia 'A' squad may hurt his chances.

559,"BEIJING, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's benchmark iron ore futures surged on Tuesday, hitting their 10% daily trading limit in morning session, as steelmakers are set to resume production after rigorous controls in the past few months following government orders.
""The supply-side of iron ore has not changed much recently, but more mills are planning to increase output next month,"" a Beijing-based trader said.
Another Shandong-based iron ore trader said the market is trading on expectation of rising steel production in December.
China had successfully controlled its January-October crude steel production at lower levels than the same period in 2020 after a raft of strict curbs and sluggish downstream demand, leaving room for steel firms to raise output for the rest of the year on a monthly basis.

562,"KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. government investigators have interviewed workers at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co's (GT.O) Malaysian factory about their working conditions, employees told Reuters, intensifying scrutiny of potential labour abuses by the tyre maker in the country.
The questioning by the Department of Homeland Security could lead to U.S. prosecutions of one of the world's biggest tyre makers, which faces related lawsuits and two ongoing investigations by regulators in Malaysia and the United States, each looking into potential exploitation of foreign workers.
Five current and former Goodyear Malaysia staff said Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents have asked about their working and living conditions, details of court cases they filed against Goodyear, a police complaint alleging threats from Goodyear staff and workplace accidents.
In video calls over the past 11 months or more, the agents from the main criminal-investigation unit of the Department of Homeland Security also requested documents relating to their employment, said the workers, who asked not to be identified because they feared reprisals.
Reuters could not determine the specific violations that HSI is seeking to establish.
HSI said it does not comment on ongoing investigations.
Ohio-based Goodyear said it was committed to ensuring its supply chain practices adhered to laws and to its own policies.
""Goodyear and Goodyear Malaysia are currently undertaking a thorough review of the matter, including retaining an independent social auditing firm to inspect working and housing conditions,"" Goodyear told Reuters in an emailed statement. Goodyear did not identify the audit firm.
The HSI questioning follows initial allegations filed in three complaints by 185 migrant workers from Nepal, India and Myanmar - including the five who spoke to Reuters - against Goodyear Malaysia in the country's industrial court in 2019 and 2020. They alleged unpaid wages, citing non-compliance with a collective agreement, wrongful deductions and threats to migrant workers.
In 2020 and in June, the court ordered Goodyear to pay back wages to some workers and comply with the agreement. The company has appealed the verdicts.
Goodyear told Reuters it has now committed to a settlement with the workers represented in the labour dispute.
The company argued in court that foreign workers are not entitled to the benefits of the collective agreement because they are not union members. It has declined to comment on the allegations.
Malaysia's largest fund manager, Permodalan Nasional Berhad, which owns 49% of Goodyear Malaysia, did not respond to requests for comment.
FOCUS ON FORCED LABOUR
Representatives from the Malaysian government's Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Council (MAPO) were also on some of the video calls with HSI, the five workers said.
Former MAPO head Mohd Hadzwan Zulkefle, who workers said was on the calls, told Reuters the agency has opened an investigation into Goodyear Malaysia over labour trafficking. He did not say when MAPO started the probe, which has not previously been reported.
He declined to comment on whether MAPO was collaborating with U.S authorities.
A MAPO spokesperson told Reuters it was aware of ""the alleged forced labour issue"" at Goodyear Malaysia, and that the issue is under investigation by ""responsible parties.""
The Department of Labour of Peninsular Malaysia, which last year charged Goodyear Malaysia with violating labour laws, did not respond to a request for comment. Goodyear has not commented on the labour department charges.
The U.S. State Department in July downgraded Malaysia to its worst ranking on human trafficking, after a string of complaints by rights groups and U.S. authorities over alleged exploitation by plantations and factories of migrant workers, on whom the Southeast Asian nation relies.
Goodyear Malaysia is already being investigated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection over its labour practices, according to Liberty Shared, a rights group that petitioned Customs for the probe. Customs can ban imports of goods it finds to be made with forced labour.
Goodyear did not respond to a query on the MAPO investigation.
The company told Reuters in July it was not aware of the petition to U.S. Customs and that it had strong policies to protect human rights.
HSI can initiate criminal investigations and coordinate potential criminal prosecutions of American firms and U.S-bound supply chains whose goods are made by means of forced labour, according to its website.
A formal HSI investigation ""would be extremely significant because it will move the discussion on forced labour from business ethics and sustainability, into one that relates to criminal law,"" said Duncan Jepson, managing director of the Hong Kong-based Liberty Shared.
However, Jepson said one challenge to establishing wrongdoing would be a lack of precedent.
In the United States, he said, ""Law enforcement and attorneys prefer to have previous cases to support their strategies and in forced labour there are no previous criminal cases against transnational corporations.""
Documents previously seen by Reuters show some Goodyear Malaysia workers logging as much as 229 hours of overtime a month, more than twice the maximum allowed under Malaysian law. Workers said money was wrongfully deducted from their salaries and that the company was denying them free access to their passports.
Goodyear has declined to comment on the allegations, citing court proceedings.
Malaysia's labour department said in May it had charged Goodyear in 2020 for nine violations of labour laws, unrelated to the lawsuits, regarding excessive hours and wrongful salary deductions.
The five workers interviewed by Reuters say they told the HSI investigators they were not happy with facilities the company provided, their hostels were congested, they paid recruitment fees in their home countries and did not get salary increases and allowances that they were eligible for.",0

570,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 23 (Reuters) - For the first time in a decade a massive new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has been approved for construction in Australia, but the Scarborough venture's structure and market realities indicate it may well be the last of its kind.
Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) and BHP Group (BHP.AX) gave final backing on Monday to the $12 billion plan to develop the Scarborough natural gas field off Western Australia and expand the onshore Pluto LNG plant to process the fuel.  read more 
The deal also sees Woodside merge with BHP's petroleum arm, with BHP shareholders to be issued new Woodside shares and ending up with about 48% of the expanded share capital.
Scarborough field lies about 375 kilometres (233 miles) off the coast of Western Australia state and holds about 11.1 trillion cubic feet of dry gas.
Woodside expects to produce about 8 million tonnes of LNG per annum at the to-be-built second train at its Pluto liquefaction plant, and is targeting first cargo in 2026.
The company also said that the all-in cost of the LNG to be produced is around $5.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), which is well below the current spot price of $36.70, but also considerably higher than the $1.85 the super-chilled fuel sank to in May last year during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Scarborough and Pluto second train developments are also the first major LNG project to reach a final investment decision in Australia in about a decade, and comes after the industry spent around $200 billion to expand capacity to around 80 million tonnes, making the country the world's biggest LNG exporter.
At first glance the deal seems positive for both Woodside and BHP.
It transforms Woodside into a top-10 global independent oil and gas company and allows BHP, the world's biggest listed miner, an opportunity to profitably exit an area of business no longer viewed as core and frees it to concentrate on producing metals viewed as essential to the energy transition.
However, it also means that Woodside will face increasing environmental opposition to its business, especially in the wake of the COP26 climate summit and mounting calls for an end to new oil, gas and coal projects.
Woodside argues that Scarborough contains ""only around 0.1% carbon dioxide, and Scarborough gas processed through the efficient and expanded Pluto LNG facility supports the decarbonisation goals of our customers in Asia.""
It's highly unlikely that environmental and climate groups will share this view, and already they are lining up to fight against the new development.
The Conservation Council of Western Australia is bringing a case challenging the state's approval, without a full environmental review, to allow Woodside to process gas at the Pluto LNG plant from an expanded number of fields.
FINANCING
While there is likely to be ongoing and highly visible opposition to Scarborough, there are also other concerns more behind the scenes.
As part of the deal, Woodside entered into an agreement to sell 49% of the planned second LNG train at the Pluto processing plant to private equity group Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).
The terms of deal effectively commit GIP to providing financing, but virtually all of the risk lies with Woodside with regards to potential cost overruns, regulatory hurdles and changes to emissions liabilities.
While GIP has a solid track record of investment in major projects around the globe, the involvement of private equity in a major LNG project in Australia breaks the usual pattern of partnering with global oil companies, major trading houses or utility customers in Asia.
The deal with GIP doesn't look advantageous to Woodside, implying that it was unable to find any takers among more traditional partners.
This could be a sign that LNG projects are getting harder to finance and that already the major buyers in Japan and South Korea are thinking of ways to meet their net-zero emissions targets by transitioning away from LNG.
The Scarborough LNG will also be hitting the market just around the same time as major expansions from Qatar and Russia also come to market, potentially creating an overhang of LNG at a time when major buyers are likely to be increasingly transitioning to renewable alternatives.
Effectively, Woodside is taking a bet that LNG will last in Asia's energy mix for far longer than it should if net-zero emissions goals are to be achieved.",0
571,"KASESE, Uganda, Nov 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mbonagaija Nestoli knows how it feels to live in fear of the river.
Massive floods have regularly torn through his village of Rwakingi, in western Uganda, destroying farms and equipment. One, in 2019, ruined three-quarters of the land on which Nestoli grows bananas, yams and sugarcane.
But the 72-year-old farmer hopes he will soon no longer worry when the rain hammers down and the waters of the Mubuku River start to rise, thanks to stands of bamboo he has planted along the riverbank.
The bamboo - increasingly widely used as a flood defense in Uganda - acts like a wall when grown, slowing water pouring from swollen rivers.
Its roots also stabilize the soil and catch silt, helping keep the riverbanks from collapsing, Nestoli explained.
""Bamboo has spreading roots which hold the soil very firmly and can allow water to still pass through while controlling the speed and strength,"" the farmer said.
The plant could also soon make it easier for Nestoli to support himself and his three grandchildren.
""When my bamboo has matured enough, I plan to sell some of it for building materials so that I earn an extra income,"" he said.
With climate change driving more frequent and devastating floods, some Ugandan communities are turning to bamboo barriers as a defense that can also provide fuel and an income.
""Bamboo is a wonder plant that can alter the challenges of climate change,"" said Bryan Toshi, co-founder of the Kampala-based Umoja Conservation Trust.
That includes ""providing a sustainable, renewable source of charcoal, resistant construction materials and a sustainable, income-generating alternative to wood cutting.""
Since 2013, community leaders and farmers' groups have been encouraging farmers like Nestoli to plant bamboo and indigenous trees along the riverbanks in flood-prone Kasese district.
Community leader Charles Nyamutare said he got the idea while attending a training session on bamboo growing run by the green group WWF.
""I sold (the idea) to the community and the response was, 'Let us try',"" he said.
""Bamboo is now one of the most important interventions we are using to control flooding,"" he said.
Before turning to the plant, villagers in Kasese tried to hold back the waters with stone-filled cages, or gabions, Nyamutare added.
""But the floods would destroy them and we realised it was not sustainable,"" he said.
Communities who join the project - backed with funding from organisations including WWF and ECOTRUST, an indigenous conservation nonprofit - plant lines of bamboo and trees on either side of a river and fence the plantation off to protect the saplings from hungry animals, Nyamutare explained.
So far, communities have planted about 1.2 million bamboo plants, stretching 40 km (24 miles) along the Sebwe River and 10 km along the Mubuku River, he said.
As a result, ""the flood intensity has been curtailed,"" Nyamutare said - though the bamboo can take some years to grow before it is strong enough to significantly curtail losses.
STRONGER FLOODS
Each year, floods impact nearly 50,000 people in Uganda, leaving dozens dead and thousands displaced. The inundations cost the country about $62 million a year in economic losses, according to the World Bank.
Such worsening flooding is being seen in many places around the world as the planet warms, speeding evaporation and making rains heavier.
During a visit to Kasese, after flooding affected at least 30 villages there in July, Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja promised to find long-term fixes.
In August, the environment ministry announced a 30 billion-shilling ($8.5 million) project to restore and protect the district's main river, the Nyamwamba.
It involves planting bamboo along the river's banks, as well as carrying out spot cleaning of the waterway and putting in place flood forecasting and early warning systems.
Bamboo offers a cheap and fast-growing way to reduce flood damage, said Evelyn Mugume, a senior environmental officer for Kasese, in an interview.
""Bamboo also has an economic value, which will help the community improve their financial status,"" she added.
From a single mother plant, a farmer can make more than 250,000 shillings ($70) a year selling bamboo for use in construction and as charcoal, said community leader Nyamutare.
He said he had made 50 million shillings ($14,000) from bamboo over the past decade.
""It's good business,"" he said.
'EATEN BY THE RIVER'
But using nature to restrain overflowing rivers is not always reliable, community officials warn.
Sometimes, the floods wash away bamboo saplings before they have time to grow strong enough to stand up to the water, Nyamutare said.
Not everyone in the area is convinced that bamboo is the best solution either.
""We have some community members who resist, saying they prefer to use their land for other things,"" he said.
Bamboo walls alone also sometimes are not enough to protect communities long-term, said John Hunwick, founder of Rwenzori Trekking Services, a local tourism company.
Hunwick, who has been planting and researching bamboo for nearly a decade, said communities could also plant more indigenous trees along riverbanks, and invest in water harvesting to catch more run-off before it can do much damage.
But Nestoli, confident his stands of bamboo will eventually protect his farm, is trying to persuade his neighbour in Rwakingi to plant as well.
""You can see how my neighbour's land is being eaten by the flooding river,"" the farmer said, pointing to a field of banana trees half-submerged in water.
""I even offered to plant bamboo for him for free. But he has insisted on using his land for agriculture only.""

That was the biggest daily percentage gain for Brent since August and its highest close since Nov. 16. It also pushed Brent's premium over WTI  to its highest since mid-October.
Talk of a coordinated reserves release, a strong U.S. dollar and a potential hit to energy demand from a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe has already caused Brent prices to drop over 10% since hitting a three-year high of $86.70 on Oct. 25.
President Joe Biden's administration said it would release 50 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which will start hitting the market in mid to late December.  read more

576,"WAUKESHA, Wis., Nov 22 (Reuters) - The man accused of deliberately driving his car into a Christmas parade near Milwaukee, killing five people and injuring dozens, was out on bail from a domestic abuse case and was suspected in another violent altercation earlier that day, officials said on Monday.
The suspect, Darrell Brooks, 39, was arrested near the scene of Sunday's vehicular attack in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and faces five counts of first-degree homicide, Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson said.

In addition to the five people killed - ranging in age from 52 to 81 - 48 were injured, including six children who remained hospitalized in critical condition on Monday, authorities said.
Among the victims were members of a parade group calling themselves the ""Dancing Grannies,"" according to a statement posted on Facebook on Monday.
Thompson said the motive for the attack was still a mystery but that it was clear the suspect had acted intentionally.
""He drove right through the barricades and the officers,"" Thompson told a briefing, adding authorities had ruled out terrorism as a motive. Waukesha County District Attorney Sue Opper said the suspect acted alone.
Police were not pursuing Brooks when he plowed into the parade, but one officer fired shots to try to stop the sport utility vehicle, the police chief said.
""Minutes after the incident occurred, I responded to the scene,"" Thompson said. ""And what I saw out of chaos and tragedy was heroes - first responders in the community coming together and working together on triaging victims.""
The FBI was assisting local police in their investigation.
Brooks has a criminal history and was last released from custody after posting $1,000 cash bond on Nov. 11, an amount the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said was ""inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges"" against him.
Brooks had been charged on Nov. 5 with obstructing an officer, battery, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct and felony bail jumping in a domestic abuse case, prosecutors and state court records show.
Around the time of Sunday's carnage, police also had received a complaint of a domestic disturbance involving Brooks and a knife but were unable to respond because they were preoccupied with the parade, Thompson said.
""Was there an initial complaint of a knife being involved? Yes,"" he said. ""Do we know if there actually was one there? We don't.""
The chief said investigators had no information suggesting Brooks, a resident of Milwaukee, knew anyone in the parade.
'STILL TOTALLY SHOCKED'
Police identified the five dead as Virginia Sorenson, 79; LeAnna Owen, 71; Tamara Durand, 52; Jane Kulich, 52; and Wilhelm Hospel, 81.
Several vigils and prayer services were held on Monday for the victims, including a memorial service attended by hundreds in a park near the scene.
“Waukesha is strong. That’s why we are out here,” said Jeremy Wittig, 39, an information technology professional, as he stood in the crowd around sunset.
Brian Hoffman, 33, a Waukesha resident, who was present when the vehicle rammed through parade attendees, described the moment as ""terrifying.""
""I saw children who were run over,"" he recounted early on Monday, sitting on a stoop near the scene. ""I am still totally shocked.""
Video of the incident posted on social media showed a red SUV racing alongside the parade route and then into the procession, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before bystanders ran from sidewalks to help.
Officials at Children's Wisconsin hospital in Milwaukee told a briefing they treated 18 children, including six who remained in critical condition and three in serious condition on Monday.
The rest were in fair condition or released. The hospital made no mention of any fatalities.
A message posted on Monday by the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies Facebook page paid tribute to those who lost their lives as ""the glue ... (that) held us together.""
""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies. Their eyes gleamed.....(with the) joy of being a Grannie,"" read the message. ""Our hearts are heavy at this most difficult time.""
Waukesha schools were closed on Monday, and additional counselors were to be made available for students, the school district superintendent said. Waukesha authorities said a fund for the affected families had been set up.

578,"ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia, Nov 22 (Reuters) - British Columbia was on the mend on Monday after heavy rains last week flooded infrastructure, displaced thousands and killed at least four in the Canadian province, but officials warned of a ""very wet"" weather forecast.
More roads have reopened, gas lines have been restored, and stable food supply secured, as emergency workers and volunteers continue to work in flood-affected areas, British Columbia officials said in a briefing on Monday.
""Our response to this emergency is still ongoing and it will be for quite some time,"" said Deputy Premier Mike Farnworth. ""With more rain falling in southern B.C., including for the hard hit Fraser Valley, we have to stay vigilant.""
The province declared a state of emergency last week after a phenomenon known as an ""atmospheric river"" brought a month's worth of rain in two days, causing floods and mudslides that  destroyed roads and houses, cut critical rail lines and shut the Trans Mountain pipeline.
A meteorologist for Environment Canada said on Monday that they are seeing ""very active weather for the foreseeable future"" and storms are expected to continue over the weekend and into next week.
""The forecast going forward for the south coast is very wet,"" meteorologist Armel Castellan said in a briefing.

579,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - OPEC+ has produced less oil than its agreed output targets, drawing scrutiny from the United States and other major consumers which want more crude from the group.  read more 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said OPEC+ production was below its target in both September and October by more than 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) and analysts expect this to continue as the group's targets rise going forward.
OPEC and the IEA have been predicting an oil surplus in the first quarter of 2022. But the production shortfall by OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and it allies, means tighter conditions may persist longer and crude prices could rise further.
WHY IS OPEC+ MISSING THE MARK?
OPEC members Nigeria and Angola are the main under-performers, as their oil industries grapple with an exodus of oil majors, years of underinvestment, maintenance issues and unplanned outages.
The two countries accounted for almost 90% of the 730,000 bpd of the OPEC+ production shortfall in October, the IEA says.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE MARKET?
The IEA said this month it expected global demand in the first quarter of 2022 to average 98.5 million bpd, lagging supply by about 1.1 million bpd.
OPEC sees global demand at 98.02 million bpd in the first quarter. It does not publish a forecast for future production, but internal data in October showed the group expected a surplus of about 2.5 million bpd in the first three months of 2022.
The U.S. Energy Information Agency (IEA) forecasts first quarter demand at about 99.83 million bpd, slightly below its forecast for supply of 99.9 million bpd.
The IEA expects Nigerian output to reach 1.46 million bpd in the first quarter, up 110,000 bpd on the previous quarter, and sees Angola's output rising by 30,000 bpd to 1.17 million bpd.
OPEC and the EIA do not provide forecasts by country.
Assuming OPEC+ sticks to its plan to raise output by 400,000 bpd each month, the IEA is expecting Nigeria and Angola to continue miss targets by more than 400,000 bpd, based on Reuters calculations, a slight improvement on the October shortfall.
But if production from the two countries faces any disruption, the market could look tighter in the first quarter.",0
580,"LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. pressure on OPEC+ to pump more oil and cool red-hot crude prices has shone a spotlight on a relatively new problem for the producer group: it doesn't have much extra capacity to hike output faster, even if it wanted to.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, are unwinding record supply curbs made in 2020 when demand cratered, but not fast enough for Washington which is fretting about prices near three-year highs.
OPEC+, which includes Russia, has resisted pressure for swifter hikes, sticking to its plan of gradually raising output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month since August, saying it worries a faster increase will lead to a glut in 2022.
Yet OPEC+ can't even hit those goals. Production by OPEC+ was 700,000 bpd less than planned in both September and October, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), raising the prospect of a tight market and high oil prices for longer.  read more 
In the past, smaller OPEC producers in Africa and even some larger ones in the Gulf could be expected to exceed quotas set by OPEC when they needed the extra cash, usually when oil prices were low.
But plunging investment in production caused by the pandemic and environmental pressure on oil majors, particularly in poorer OPEC states, means just three OPEC members - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq - have the extra capacity in place to hike supplies relatively quickly.
""Recent data support our long-held expectation that a growing number of members are running out of spare capacity,"" consultancy Energy Aspects wrote in a note.
PRESSING FOR MORE
Under President Donald Trump, Washington had pressed OPEC+ to slash output in 2020 when prices tanked and threatened to crush the U.S. oil industry. The group agreed to sweeping cuts of about 10 million bpd, or a record 10% of global supply.
As demand has rebounded faster than many expected, President Joe Biden's administration has repeatedly pressed OPEC+ for more supply, fearing high crude prices - Brent  is up more than 50% so far this year - could choke a global recovery.
""OPEC+ remains deaf to political pressure to accelerate supply increases,"" Energy Aspects said.
Unable to persuade OPEC+ to pump more and facing low approval ratings ahead of next year's mid-term congressional elections, Biden has asked China, India, South Korea and Japan for a coordinated oil stocks release.  read more 
Yet such a move is complicated by the mandate of the Paris-based IEA, which represents industrialised nations. Under its rules, reserves should be released to cope with shocks, such as wars or hurricanes, not to correct prices.
""A (stocks) release would only provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit and would create clear upside risks to our 2022 price forecast,"" Goldman Sachs wrote.
Although higher crude prices could help push up supply, it said investment was being hampered by environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns and worries about global warming, with banks charging more on loans for oil than green projects.
""The damage to investors caused by oil producers' capital destruction over the last seven years is now compounded by ESG allocation inefficiencies,"" Goldman said.
According to its schedule for unwinding output curbs, OPEC+ will officially have 3.8 million bpd of cuts in place as of Dec. 1. But, with some OPEC+ members unable to raise output enough, the actual cut remains bigger.
DIMINISHING BUFFER
The IEA said Angola and Nigeria accounted for nearly 90% of the 730,000 bpd OPEC+ production shortfall in October.
Energy Aspects says it expects the OPEC+ production ""gap to steadily grow as quotas keep rising.""
Even if OPEC+ producers picked up the pace, it would whittle away at a spare production capacity cushion, which could alarm investors and drive up prices if the world no longer had enough extra capacity to cope with a shock, industry experts say.
""The industry's spare capacity, currently at 3-4 million bpd is providing some comfort to the market, however, my concern is that the buffer ... might diminish,"" Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser told the Nikkei Global Management Forum.
Saudi Arabia is now producing close to 10 million bpd but has never produced more than 11 million bpd for a sustained period of many months, even though it says it has more capacity available. Russian producers such as Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM) said they have struggled to produce more.
The U.S. oil shale industry, which has in recent years turned the United States from a net crude importer to an exporter, might help ease price pressures by hiking output.  read more

581,"SHANGHAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's policy regarding data transfer and localisation are causing companies to cancel projects due to fears of compliance issues, according to a report from the British Chamber of Commerce in China published on Tuesday.
""The uncertainty is causing considerable anxiety, as it could create insurmountable barriers to data flowing from China,"" the chamber writes.
""Some businesses are already affected by slowed data flows – one business has canceled two thirds of their planned R&D projects in China, while another has been forced to downgrade the quality of service they provide to clients.""
The report describes legal requirements for overseas companies to store data locally in China and conduct ""security reviews"" before transferring data overseas as ""costly"" and ""restrictive,"" diverting resources away from more productive R&D endeavors.
The chamber adds that other parts of the laws remain too vague. Authorities, for example, require companies that transfer ""important data"" to undergo security reviews, but the definition of important data remains too imprecise, the chamber argues.
Meanwhile, the exact administrative requirements for conducting a security assessment have also confused British companies.
""These gaps and ambitious articles throughout China's cybersecurity legislation have created significant challenges for British companies in trying to ensure compliance, hampering their ability to use data to make business decisions at a global and local level.""
The chamber recommended that Chinese authorities take efforts to clarify its policies to allow foreign companies in China to share as much data with overseas divisions as possible.
This year, China implemented the Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law, two key provisions dictating how companies must store, protect, and share data.",0

583,"SEOUL/AUSTIN, Texas, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) said on Wednesday it had picked Taylor, Texas as the location for a new $17 billion plant to make advanced chips for functions such as mobile, 5G, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence.
The plant would create 2,000 high-tech jobs with construction to begin in the first half of next year, and production due to start in the second half of 2024, the South Korean tech giant said. It would also create at least 6,500 construction jobs, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.
The world's biggest memory chipmaker and second-largest contract chip manufacturer had also considered sites in Arizona and New York for the plant, which will be much bigger than its only other U.S. chip plant in Austin, Texas.
The company said it chose Texas based on factors such as infrastructure stability, government support and proximity to its existing plant.
Samsung is joining rivals TSMC (2330.TW) and Intel (INTC.O) in the race to expand chip contract manufacturing in the United States, where the sector is seen as an area of strategic competition with China.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has promised billions of dollars in federal funding to boost chip manufacturing and research to ensure it has an edge over China in advanced technologies and to address shortages for critical industries like autos.  read more 
""Securing America's supply chains is a top priority for President Biden and his Administration,"" U.S. National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement welcoming Samsung's investment.
""We will continue to use every tool and pursue every avenue to invest in our sources of strength like manufacturing and technology.""
Abbott, flanked at a press conference by Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Kinam Kim and U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, said the company's decision was a testament to Texas's economic environment built on low taxes, reasonable regulations and robust infrastructure.
Texas last winter suffered a multi-day, widespread power outage, causing some 300-400 billion won ($254-$339 million) in damages to Samsung's existing chip plant in Austin, Texas.
""I'm extremely confident that the power grid is stable, resilient and reliable,"" Abbott said on Tuesday when asked about electricity supply for the plant.
The new site in Texas's Williamson County, which comprises the city of Taylor, offered the best incentives package of the sites Samsung was considering, sources previously told Reuters.  read more 
NATIONAL SECURITY
Senator Cornyn on Tuesday called on the Biden administration to invest more money to attract chip manufacturers to the United States, calling it a ""national security imperative.""
""If China continues to saber-rattle, the majority of the world could be at their mercy when it comes to the supply of critical semiconductors,"" Cornyn said.
Samsung's Kim thanked the Biden administration for ""creating an environment that supports companies like Samsung as we work to expand leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.""
""We also thank the administration and Congress for their bipartisan support to swiftly enact federal incentives for domestic chip production and innovation.""
Samsung has not specified what the new plant will make beyond advanced logic chips which can be used to power mobile devices and autonomous vehicles.
Analysts said it would likely make cutting-edge chips of 5-nanometres or less, using machines made by the Netherland's ASML (ASML.AS), for large clients like Qualcomm (QCOM.O). Such chips can handle more data per area than the 14- and 28-nanometre chips Samsung's existing U.S. plant in Austin mainly makes.
The Taylor site, about 25 miles (40 kms) from Austin, spans more than 5 million square metres, Samsung said.

587,"Nov 22 (Reuters) -     The United States on Monday imposed further sanctions in connection with the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, targeting Russia-linked Transadria Ltd. and its vessel.
    The State Department submitted a report to the U.S. Congress listing two vessels and an entity, Transadria Ltd., involved in the pipeline, Blinken said, but did not give details on the second vessel.
    Washington opposes the $11 billion pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to bypass Ukraine and carry gas from Russia's Arctic region to Germany.
    Nord Stream 2 has faced stiff opposition from the United States and some European states, which say it will make Europe too reliant on Russian gas. But other European governments say the link is vital to secure energy supplies, with gas prices surging in recent weeks and the threat of power outages looming this winter. 
    The Biden administration has waived sanctions on the pipeline's operator and reached an agreement with Germany in July over the pipeline. Germany agreed to take action if Russia uses energy as a weapon in its relations with Ukraine, but the pact did not provide a specific criteria for how that would be judged.
    Last week, Germany's energy regulator temporarily halted the certification process for the new pipeline that will carry Russian gas into Europe, throwing up a new roadblock to the contentious project and driving up regional gas prices.
    ""Even as the administration continues to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, including via our sanctions, we continue to work with Germany and other allies and partners to reduce the risks posed by the pipeline to Ukraine and frontline NATO and EU countries and to push back against harmful Russian activities, including in the energy sphere,"" Blinken said.

Inflation in Asia's fourth-largest economy accelerated to nearly the highest in a decade in October, reinforcing the need for the Bank of Korea (BOK) to act now to prevent it from accelerating further.
All but one of 30 economists in a Nov. 15-22 Reuters poll predicted the BOK would raise its base rate (KROCRT=ECI) by 25 basis points to 1.00% at its Nov. 25 policy meeting.
One dissenter predicted a 50 basis point hike, which if realised would bring rates back to 1.25%, where they were before the pandemic.
""We believe the current economic conditions are strong enough to allow the BOK to proceed with a further rate hike, in order to contain the rise in inflation or inflation expectations and stabilise the property market,"" said Ma Tieying, an economist at DBS in Singapore.
Most economists have brought forward their forecasts for rate hikes and agree there is more tightening coming, and see the interest rate reaching 1.25% in the first quarter of next year and 1.50% by end-2022.
Although medians predict the base rate to remain steady thereafter, a few respondents forecast rates to reach as high as 2.00% by end-2023.
""We think one or two more hikes are possible during next year given higher inflation than the BOK's target,"" said Ji-man Kim, an economist at Samsung Securities in Seoul. ""We think the Monetary Policy Board will continue to pay attention to financial stability as long as the increase in household loans remains high.""
The consumer price index (CPI) jumped 3.2% from a year earlier in October, the highest since January 2012 and the seventh straight month above the central bank's 2% target.
As in most economies, supply-side pressures and elevated oil prices are likely to keep inflation high for a while. The central bank will announce revised inflation forecasts on Thursday.
High levels of household debt and rapidly rising real estate prices will also figure prominently in Thursday's policy decision.
Koreans have been borrowing more than ever before and household debt is now roughly equivalent to the country's GDP. A few economists polled said that surge has showed some signs of slowing since the last rate hike in August.
Still, household debt levels in South Korea are among the highest globally and policymakers are increasingly worried that skyrocketing property prices have become a risk to the economy.
That, along with waning pandemic-related stimulus and an economic slowdown in China, the country's largest trade and investment partner, will weigh heavily on the economy next year.
""Macro uncertainties have increased...(and) overall macro policy uncertainty is also getting elevated in a run-up to the March presidential election,"" noted Maggie Wei, an economist at Goldman Sachs.
""While our baseline scenario remains for two 25bps hikes next year...the risk is slightly skewed to the dovish side with a possible shift of the first hike next year to the second half, broadly in sync with our forecast for the pace of monetary policy normalization in the U.S.""",0
589,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday urged President Joe Biden to release crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and reinstate - at least temporarily - a ban on oil exports to help drive down surging energy prices.
The Democrats told Biden in a letter spearheaded by California Democrat Ro Khanna that urgent action was needed to ensure ""affordable and reliable energy for American families.""
The letter, signed by eight other House Democrats, calls on Biden to ""use all tools at our disposal to bring down gasoline prices in the short term."" Eleven Senate Democrats wrote a similar letter to Biden earlier this month, citing OPEC constraints on supplies and U.S. exports.
The U.S. Department of Energy is expected to announce a loan of oil from the SPR on Tuesday in coordination with several other countries, a Biden administration source familiar with the situation said.  read more 
Biden could discuss the move during a speech on the U.S. economy and his administration's efforts to reverse surging costs on Tuesday.
Khanna said addressing inflation and Americans' concerns was a central responsibility for Democrats, who risk losing control of Congress in mid-term elections next year.
""We have to make it clear we're doing everything we can to tackle inflation,"" Khanna told Reuters.
Reports about a coordinated release of oil from several countries' reserves drove down oil prices sharply last week.
In their letter to Biden, the Democrats argued that a ban on oil exports could boost domestic supplies and further lower consumer prices, which recently hit a 31-year high.
""The economics of it make sense,"" Khanna said, adding that he understood Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was considering the move. A temporary ban on exports would help boost domestic supply, helping to lower prices, without having any major impact on the global oil market, he said.
The U.S. Congress voted in 2015 to repeal a 40-year-old ban on exporting U.S. crude oil in an energy policy shift sought by Republicans as part of a bipartisan deal that also provided unprecedented tax incentives for wind and solar power.
Biden has authority under the legislation to declare an emergency and limit or stop oil exports for up to a year, although experts have said the odds of him doing so are slim.",0

592,"SHANGHAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's cyberspace regulator said on Tuesdayit will tighten oversight over how celebrity information is disseminated online, such as the publishing of their personal details and the placements of their advertisements on internet sites.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said this was aimed at creating a positive and healthy internet environment, describing the proliferation of gossip and star-chasing as impacting mainstream values.
It said it would create a ""negative list"" that would target online celebrity information that promoted bad values such as ostentatious wealth as well as any attempts to encourage fans to spend money to support celebrities.
Celebrity endorsements and advertisements should be clearly marked out by platforms, the CAC said, and fan clubs must be managed by authorized agents.
Chinese authorities in recent months have moved to dampen what they have called the country's ""chaotic"" celebrity fan culture, ordering broadcasters, online platforms and artists to help curb the phenomenon after a series of celebrity scandals involving tax evasion and sexual assault.
Online celebrity fan clubs had become a widespread phenomenon in China with local newspaper The Paper projecting the country's ""idol economy"" could be worth 140 billion yuan ($22 billion) by 2022. But they have also been criticised for their influence over minors and for causing social disorder.
When Canadian-Chinese pop star Kris Wu was detained by Beijing police in July on suspicion of sexual assault, his fan groups come to his defence on social media. Most of these fan accounts, along with Wu's online accounts, were later shut down.
Chinese authorities have also ordered actors and other performers to follow moral guidelines or face being banned.

593,"BOSTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Gun makers including Smith & Wesson (SWBI.O) and Sturm, Ruger & Co (RGR.N) on Monday asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit by the Mexican government accusing them of facilitating the trafficking of weapons to drug cartels, leading to thousands of deaths.
The gun manufacturers in a brief told a federal judge in Boston that Mexico was seeking through its $10 billion lawsuit to punish them for sales of firearms ""that are not only lawful but constitutionally protected in the United States.""
The companies, who also include Beretta USA, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Colt's Manufacturing Co and Glock Inc argued Mexico was trying to use U.S. courts to circumvent a diplomatic dispute with the United States yet lacked the ability to sue them.
Successive Mexican governments have urged the United States to put a stop to the illicit trafficking of U.S. firearms into Mexico.
""At bottom, this case implicates a clash of national values,"" the companies argued. ""Whereas the United States recognizes the right to keep and bear arms, Mexico has all but eliminated private gun ownership.""
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard during a United Nations Security Council meeting on small arms on Monday called the country's decision to file the unusual lawsuit in August ""a question of principle and a moral obligation.""
The lawsuit claimed the companies undermined Mexico's strict gun laws by designing, marketing and distributing military-style assault weapons in ways they knew would arm drug cartels, fueling murders, extortions and kidnappings.
Mexico's lawsuit said over 500,000 guns are trafficked annually from the United States into Mexico, of which more than 68% are made by the manufacturers it sued.
The companies argued Mexico failed to establish its harms were attributable to them and that a U.S. law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, protected gun manufactures from lawsuits over their products' misuse.
While the companies said Mexico believed the law does not apply to its claims, ""the plain text of the statute forecloses that theory.""
Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement it would respond to the companies' arguments on Jan. 31.",0

U.S. President Joe Biden has asked China, India, South Korea and Japan for a coordinated release of oil stocks as U.S. gasoline prices soar and his approval ratings slump ahead of next year's congressional elections.
The White House has also repeatedly pressed the OPEC producer group - which plans to meet on Dec. 2 - to maintain adequate global supply.
However, it has not been able to persuade OPEC+, which groups OPEC and allies including Russia, to pump more oil, with major producers arguing the world was not short of crude.
Reuters reported on Monday that Japanese and Indian officials are working on ways to release national reserves of crude oil in tandem with the United States and other major economies.  read more

597,"DUBLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Irish consumer sentiment weakened slightly in November, with respondents reporting a range of worries from higher energy bills and problems in Ireland's housing market to a surge in COVID-19 cases, a survey found on Tuesday.
The KBC Bank Ireland consumer sentiment index declined to 83.1 in November from 86.8 in October. The monthly drop was the largest since January and brings the sentiment index to its lowest level since April.
A special question added to the survey for November found that only one in eight consumers plans to spend more this Christmas than last, while one in three expects to spend less.
KBC Ireland chief economist Austin Hughes said the weakest elements in the November survey related to the outlook for the economy and jobs, areas that were strongest in October when a range of upbeat forecasts reduced concerns about changes to the global tax framework.
He said headlines in November were ""notably gloomier,"" with ""a significant focus on the scale of problems in Ireland's housing market as well as broader concerns about sharply rising living costs"".
Speculation about the reimposition of health-related restrictions was also more widespread during the November survey period.
Hughes said the November reading does not point to a markedly poorer outlook but suggests that consumers fear improvements in their household finances might fall short of expectations.",0
598,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Tile Inc, a maker of tracking tags that was a vocal critic of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), has been acquired by Life360 (LIFX.PK), a location-sharing app maker.
The deal was valued at $205 million after Tile had raised $141 million in venture capital since its founding in 2012, a return of just 1.45 times invested capital.
Apple once carried Tile's tracking tags in Apple Stores. But in testimony before U.S. lawmakers last year, Tile executives said Apple began to distance itself from the startup company because it was readying its own tracking tag product.
Tile executives said Apple implemented technical changes that made it harder to pair its products with iPhones.
The rival Apple product - $30 AirTags, tiny devices meant to be attached to keys or other valuables - is more seamless for iPhone owners to use than third-party devices like Tile unless the third-party companies use special tools provided by Apple.
Apple says those tools are designed to protect the privacy of its users by preventing third-party tracking tag companies from amassing data on users.
Tile said that using Apple's tools would prevent it from having its own app and make its business model infeasible.
Tile still makes tags that work with both Apple and non-Apple devices, although they have less functionality than AirTags when used with iPhones because of Apple's rules.
Under the deal Monday, the companies said that Tile will continue under its own brand identity under the leadership of Tile CEO CJ Prober, who will also join the Life360 board of directors. The two companies said Tile's team of employees is expected to remain in place.",0

""We are living through an era of deep inequality, and nothing could be more important than ensuring workers are paid fairly and their benefits are safeguarded,"" Chiu said in a statement.

""While we deny any wrongdoing, we feel that this settlement represents a fair compromise that will allow us to focus on continuing to provide the best experience for Dashers,"" the company said.
The city opened a formal investigation into DoorDash in 2019 after media reports said the company was using customer tips to subsidize workers' base pay.
The city alleged DoorDash was violating San Francisco's health care benefit and paid sick leave laws by misclassifying workers as independent contractors, rather than employees.
The settlement is part of a larger fight between gig economy companies and lawmakers, which culminated in a California ballot initiative in Nov. 2020, during which voters cemented gig workers' status as independent contractors, while entitling them to some benefits.

605,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday said El Salvador should not use bitcoin as legal tender, considering risks related to the cryptocurrency.
""Given bitcoin's high price volatility, its use as a legal tender entails significant risks to consumer protection, financial integrity, and financial stability,"" the IMF said in its staff concluding statement of the 2021 Article IV mission to El Salvador. ""Its use also gives rise to fiscal contingent liabilities.""
The IMF regularly undertakes Article IV missions to member countries to consult with government officials before they request to use IMF resources.
In September, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.
""Because of those risks, bitcoin should not be used as a legal tender. Staff recommends narrowing the scope of the bitcoin law and urges strengthening the regulation and supervision of the new payment ecosystem,"" said the IMF.
The IMF statement came only two days after President Nayib Bukele announced El Salvador was planning to build the world's first ""bitcoin city"", which will be funded initially by bitcoin bonds.
Bukele said the city would get its energy supply from a volcano and would not levy any taxes except for value added tax.
Bukele has championed the adoption of bitcoin, arguing it will help millions of Salvadorans living abroad send remittances back home. He has also said it will bring financial inclusion, investment, tourism, and development.
""Although we obviously do not agree on some things, such as the adoption of #Bitcoin, the analysis it makes of our country is interesting,"" Bukele said of the IMF statement.
The IMF also estimated El Salvador's economy will grow around 10% in 2021 and 3.2% in 2022 and said it expects the Central American nation's public debt to reach 85% of its GDP by the end of 2021.",0
606,"MIZATA, El Salvador/LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - El Salvador plans to build the world's first ""Bitcoin City"" with money from a $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond the country's President Nayib Bukele said on Saturday.
Here is what we know about the proposed bond and some of the details that still need to be filled in.
WHAT WE KNOW
Bukele said El Salvador planned to issue the bond in 2022, suggesting it could be as soon as in 60 days time.
Half of the $1 billion sum would be converted to bitcoin and the other half used for infrastructure and bitcoin mining.
Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain technology company Blockstream who was on stage with Bukele said that the 'volcano bonds' - the new city will be powered with geothermal energy from a nearby volcano - will be U.S. dollar-denominated 10-year bonds and carry a coupon of 6.5%.
That is well below the 13.5% interest rate yield El Salvador's 10-year bonds  are currently trading at. The premium investors demand to hold El Salvador bonds rather than ultra-safe U.S. government bonds has also more than doubled since June when Bukele's push to make bitcoin legal tender started. (.JPMEGDELSR)
More bitcoin-back bonds are also planned and Mow said he expected other countries to do the same. He also speculated that  the moves would absorb enough bitcoin to push up the value of cryptocurrency. That would allow El Salvador to then pay off the bond with profits made from selling the bitcoin again.
After a five year 'lock-up', El Salvador could also start selling some of the bitcoin to give investors an ""additional coupon"" every year, Mow said.
Crypto exchange Bitfinex was listed as the book runner for the bond on a presentation shown on a large screen on the stage. The bonds will be sold in $100 tranches to ""democratize access"" to them.
The bonds will be able to be traded 24/7 with other assets like stablecoins, according to a blogpost from Blockstream, Mow's company which plans to issue the bonds.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW
It is not known when exactly next year the bond would be launched or when El Salvador would buy the $500 million worth of bitcoin it sees as crucial to the plan.
The legal rights of would-be buyers have also not yet been detailed. Most government bonds are strict legal contracts that mean the government is accountable if the debt is not repaid in full and on time. Those that are sold on international bond markets in dollars are often issued under widely-trusted U.S. or British laws.
It is also not known what would happen to the new bonds if the country defaulted on its existing traditional bonds. The government's next bond deadline is an $800 million repayment due in January 2023. That bond is currently trading at a near 20% discount from its face value due to El Salvador's debt problems.

Two caravans of migrants largely from Haiti and Central America have departed from the southern city of Tapachula in recent weeks, many taking off on foot for the long journey in hopes of reaching the U.S.-Mexico border.
Thousands of people have also remained in Tapachula, close to the Guatemala border, where they are applying for refugee status and hope to receive visas to let them transit the country.
About 130,000 people will have requested asylum or protected status by year's end, Mexico's Interior Ministry projected on Monday. More than 50,000 of the 116,500 applications received so far this year were from Haitians, it added.
Migrants typically request asylum as a first step to receive a visa letting them travel freely within Mexico.
""We need documents to be able to move around here in Mexico,"" said Haitian migrant Robinson, 31, who declined to give his last name, adding that fellow migrants who try to cross the country without a proper visa get sent back to Tapachula.
""It can't be this way,"" he said, speaking outside the stadium, where Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) has set up makeshift offices to handle a surge in demand.
INM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The rise in the number of Haitians trying to make their way through Mexico has been spurred by economic malaise, an earthquake and political turmoil following the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise in July.
The group outside the stadium in Tapachula on Monday also included Cuban and Venezuelan migrants.
About 100 kms (62 miles) away in the city of Mapastepec, a northbound migrant caravan with about 2,500 people, mostly from Haiti, took a break after walking since before dawn.
Loubens Narcisse said he hoped to land a visa more easily in another state of Mexico, even if he had to walk hundreds of kilometers.

610,"(Reuters) - Cravath, Swaine & Moore said Monday that it will pay its associates year-end bonuses next month ranging from $15,000 to $115,000, upping the ante in a period of swollen paychecks for lawyers at major U.S. law firms.
The announcement is the first by a top firm detailing year-end bonus amounts this year, setting a new, higher scale that the firm's competitors will face pressure to match or exceed. A Cravath spokesperson declined to comment. The move was announced in an internal memo and first reported by legal blog Above the Law.
The Wall Street firm will distribute the bonuses on Dec. 17, and associates must “still be at the firm” on that date to be eligible, according to the memo.
Law firms have already offered multiple rounds of bonuses since the start of the pandemic, both to recognize associates' efforts during the crisis and to entice them to stick around amid a crush of work on corporate deals and other matters.
Cravath is among dozens of firms that offered two-installment “special” bonuses in the spring and fall, ranging from $6,000 up to $32,000 for its most senior associates. It also joined a wave of firms boosting associate salaries this summer, hiking pay for first-year associates from $190,000 to $205,000.
A report this month by Thomson Reuters Peer Monitor Index, which tracks economic indicators at large and midsized law firms, found direct expenses grew more than 7% over the past year, fueled largely by associate raises and bonuses.
According to Monday's memo, the firm will pay year-end bonuses of $15,000 (pro-rated) for the class of 2021; $20,000 for the class of 2020; $30,000 for the class of 2019; $57,500 for the class of 2018; $75,000 for the class of 2017; $90,000 for the class of 2016; $105,000 for the class of 2015; and $115,000 for the class of 2014.

611,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government has been hit with two proposed class actions seeking to hold it responsible for paying unemployment benefits under last year's COVID-19 relief law to residents of states that ended the benefits early.
The lawsuits, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas and the Court of Federal Claims, both say the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was enacted in March 2020, made payments to people who lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic mandatory under the law, even if state governments decided to stop administering them.
The U.S. Department of Labor, which oversaw the so-called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) at the federal level, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twenty-five Republican-controlled states, including Texas, Georgia and Iowa, cut off some form of COVID relief benefits before they were set to end under the CARES Act in September. Twenty of the states cut off PUA, according to the lawsuits.
While workers have sued some of those states, Danny Rosenthal of James & Hoffman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he believed Monday's lawsuit was the first seeking recovery from the federal government.
The plaintiffs brought their cases under the federal Tucker Act, which waives the government's usual sovereign immunity from being sued in cases where plaintiffs claim that they are owed mandatory payment under a federal statute.
They say that, under the CARES Act, the federal government ""shall provide"" the unemployment funds. While the law stated that the program was to be managed through agreements with states that have an ""adequate system"" for administering payments, it did not remove the federal government's obligation to beneficiaries in states without such a system.
""In describing the Secretary of Labor's obligation to provide PUA payments, the language of the CARES Act is clear and mandatory,"" both lawsuits said. ""It does not grant discretion to the Secretary or states to deny PUA payments guaranteed by the Act to qualified individuals.""
The plaintiffs are seeking judgments against the government for the amount all class members would have received if their benefits had not been cut off early. The proposed classes likely includes hundreds of thousands of people, according to the complaints.
The plaintiffs did not say how much money they were seeking for the class. All of the individual plaintiffs are seeking under $10,000.
The cases are Creager Ireland v. United States, U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, No. 21-cv-01049, and Beaty v. United States, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, No. 21-cv-02195.

After inspection tours of 22 cities and 23 venues a FIFA delegation will now submit a report from which 16 hosts will be chosen although FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer Colin Smith suggested that number was not written in stone.
""When the bid was presented 16 was referenced and we've taken note but ultimately it is up to FIFA,"" said Smith, following a lunch-time media conference on the top floor of a downtown Toronto hotel overlooking Canada's national stadium BMO Field. ""We'll wrap up these visits and then we will decide the most appropriate number we need to host the tournament.
""We haven't set the exact time (of the venue announcement) yet but I suspect it will be more likely April than March.
Toronto and Edmonton are the two Canadian cities bidding for games while Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City are the Mexico candidates.
With the 2026 World Cup expanding to a record 48 teams, the joint bid calls for Canada and Mexico to each get 10 games with the rest going to the United States.
Atlanta,  Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle and Washington, D.C. are potential U.S. venues.
The FIFA delegation looked at everything from infrastructure to legacy projects to stadiums and practice facilities.
""Overall we have been absolutely delighted with the quality of the presentations,"" said Smith. ""It has been a very competitive process, one that is going to make our decision all the more harder.""
Vancouver, venue for the 2015 Women's World Cup final, has expressed late interest in getting in on the World Cup action but Victor Montagliani, the CONCACAF president and FIFA vice-president, on Monday threw cold water on the suggestion.

""Niantic is building a platform for AR based on a 3D map of the world that we believe will play a critical role in the next transition in computing,"" said Matt Mazzeo, a general partner at Coatue.

Niantic launched Pikmin Bloom with Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T)last month, an AR-based smartphone app that enables users to see tiny, plant-like creatures. It had partnered with Nintendo for Pokemon Go a few years earlier, the first game that saw a mass market adoption of AR.",0
614,"ASUNCION, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The Central Bank of Paraguay raised its monetary policy interest rate by 125 basis points to 4.0% on Monday, hiking the key rate for the second consecutive month in an attempt to curb inflation as the economy recovers from last year's COVID-19 lockdown.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee unanimously decided to increase the rate, it said in a statement, noting what has been an increase in food and energy prices.
""The rise in inflation is explained, to a large extent, by the increase in the prices of food and energy commodities in international markets. Additionally, the greater external demand for beef has put additional pressure on local prices"", it said.
Paraguay, like neighboring Argentina, is a beef exporter.

615,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - A Florida judge on Monday posthumously exonerated four Black men, known as the ""Groveland Four,"" wrongly accused of raping a white teenager 72 years ago during the Jim Crow era of Southern U.S. racial segregation.
Lake County Circuit Court Judge Heidi Davis took a final step in the cases of Charles Greenlee, Walter Irvin, Sam Shepherd and Ernest Thomas, the last gunned down by a posse before facing trial. The four men had been officially and posthumously pardoned in 2019.
Davis set aside the judgments and sentences of Irvin and Greenlee and dismissed the indictments of the other two.
In a motion seeking their exoneration, Florida state attorney Bill Gladson said newly uncovered evidence called into question whether any rape was committed and strongly suggested that ""the sheriff, the judge, and the prosecutor all but ensured guilty verdicts in this case.""
""We followed the evidence to see where it led us and it led us to this moment,"" Gladson told a news conference on Monday.
Widespread interest in the Groveland Four was renewed in 2012 by Gilbert King's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ""Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys and the Dawn of a New America.""
Days after the four were accused of abducting and sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl in 1949 near Groveland, Florida,  Thomas was hunted down by a posse of over 1,000 men and shot 400 times.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1951 unanimously overturned the convictions of Shepherd and Irvin, who were defended by National Association for the Advancement of Colored People attorney Thurgood Marshall, who later became the first Black U.S. Supreme Court justice.
That same year, Lake County Sheriff Willis McCall shot the two men, killing Shepherd, as he transported them to a pretrial hearing. McCall alleged they were trying to escape.
Irvin was retried and convicted again. He was paroled in 1968 and found dead a year later under suspicious circumstances.

""The economy is projected to recover in 2021 and 2022, but the outlook remains uncertain and challenging,"" it said in a statement.
After a contraction of 4.9% in 2020, Algeria's real GDP grew by 2.3% year-on year in the first half of 2021 ""driven by a rebound um hydrocarbon prices and production and the relaxation of containment measures"", the IMF said.
Also, the external current account balance improved ""significantly"" in the first six months of the year following ""a marked deterioration"" last year, it added.
After conducting the first Article IV consultations with Algeria since 2018, the fund warned in October that the country risks unprecedented financing needs in the medium term if it continues to run high fiscal deficits, and urged big policy changes. 
A major oil and gas producer, Algeria has suffered years of shrinking energy revenue with both prices and output sliding since 2014, and it has made little progress diversifying its state-centred economy.
Algeria has burned through most of its foreign currency reserves over the past seven years, though it has little public debt.
""While a gradual recovery is underway, pre-pandemic vulnerabilities remain and risks to the economic outlook are on the downside,"" the IMF said on Monday.

How the government votes on the defence strategy at a shareholders meeting this week has been in focus as proxy advisory firms have sided with Shinsei, possibly swaying the vote of foreign investors who account for nearly 30% of registered shareholders.  read more 
The government and SBI each own about 20% of Shinsei.
DICJ could not immediately be reached for comment.
Sources - both for and against Shinsei's strategy - have said a government vote against the poison pill would almost certainly defeat Shinsei's plan, with some hedge fund investors in favour of SBI's bid.
The Nikkei business daily said City Index Eleventh, a fund backed by activist investor Yoshiaki Murakami that holds about a 4% voting stake, would not vote in favour of Shinsei's plan. City Index Eleventh could not immediately be reached for comment.
Online financial group SBI announced an offer to take a near-majority stake in the mid-sized Tokyo-based lender in September - an unsolicited bid that met immediate opposition from Shinsei's management.
Proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS), meanwhile, have recommended shareholders vote for the lender's plan, with the latter saying SBI's partial offer would leave shareholders unable to tender. Recommendations from the two typically impact how foreign investors vote.
The SBI-Shinsei battle comes at a time Japan is witnessing a rise in hostile takeovers. But investors are also watching to see if, under a new prime minister, it will roll back some pro-market policies.

620,"(Reuters) - The Johnson & Johnson subsidiary that holds the company's talc liabilities is tentatively set to defend its decision to file for bankruptcy in February.
The newly assigned judge overseeing the Chapter 11 case, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan said during a hearing in his Trenton, New Jersey courtroom on Monday that he would block off four days beginning on Feb. 15 for a hearing on a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy. The motion will be filed soon by the talc claimants’ committee, which represents people who have sued J&J alleging that its talc products cause mesothelioma and ovarian cancer.
Monday’s hearing was the first in the case since it was transferred from a North Carolina court, where the bankruptcy kicked off. J&J subsidiary LTL Management LLC filed for Chapter 11 protection in October to consolidate and settle around 38,000 talc-related legal claims. J&J maintains that its talc products are safe and that bankruptcy is the best way to handle the claims.
Kaplan said on Monday that he understood that “a number of you here would prefer not to be in Trenton,” referring to J&J’s intention to pursue the bankruptcy in the Western District of North Carolina, a court that has garnered a reputation for being friendly to businesses looking to rid themselves of asbestos liabilities. But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Craig Whitley decided earlier this month that the case should be in New Jersey, where J&J is headquartered and where a large chunk of the talc litigation is concentrated.
“We’ll play the hand that’s dealt us,” Kaplan said of the case being moved to his court.
Shortly after Whitley transferred the case to New Jersey, J&J announced plans to spin off its consumer health division from its pharmaceutical business. The company has said the move has nothing to do with its talc liabilities.
However, the talc claimants committee challenged that position in court papers, saying that a spinoff would create barriers between the claimants and J&J assets that could be used to compensate them.
The committee has disputed the legitimacy of the bankruptcy overall, saying J&J is trying to use it to gain an upper hand in existing talc litigation by preventing plaintiffs from having their day in court. One major case that has been pending for five years is on the verge of trial.
LTL plans to request mediation during the bankruptcy, which Kaplan said he generally supports.

Stockton and Lawrence were members of the group We Build the Wall, which was raided by federal agents in August 2020 as part of a fraud investigation.

622,"(Reuters) - A long-shot appellate bet has paid off for three investors who lost millions of dollars on their holdings in Nikola Corp and will now lead the securities fraud class action against the electric truck maker.
Their appointment as lead plaintiffs, in a Nov. 18 ruling by U.S. District Judge Steven Logan of Phoenix, marks one of the first applications of new procedures established by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the investors’ mandamus case. Logan’s ruling, said co-lead counsel Jeffrey Block of Block & Leviton, clarifies that trial courts evaluating lead plaintiff motions by investor groups should focus on whether the groups have shown an ability to work together on the litigation – not on whether investors knew each other before the case.
That’s a boon for shareholder lawyers, who often bring together pairs or small groups of investors for bids to lead securities class actions. As you know, the candidate who claims to have lost the most money as a result of the alleged fraud is presumed to be the lead shareholder, although competing lead plaintiff candidates can try to rebut that presumption. So investors who team up to combine their claimed losses may have a better chance at the presumptive lead spot.
Logan’s new decision in the Nikola case shows that rival lead plaintiffs can’t knock investor groups out of contention simply by arguing that the groups have been assembled by plaintiffs lawyers. The case also, as I’ll explain, offers a good instructions for investor groups (and shareholder lawyers) worried about fending off lead plaintiff challenges.
The Nikola class action alleges that investors were defrauded when the company and former CEO Trevor Milton made false claims about Nikola’s technological advances and manufacturing capabilities. The company, which did not respond to my query, announced earlier this month that it would pay $125 million to settle a prospective U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case mirroring the allegations in the private litigation.
The judge overseeing the class action refused last December to appoint the Nikola investor group as lead plaintiff. The group, represented by Pomerantz, Labaton Sucharow and Keller Rohrback, in addition to Block & Leviton, claimed the biggest losses in the case – more than $6 million, compared to only $1.5 million from the candidate with the next-largest claim. Moreover, two of the three investors in the group individually lost more money than any of the other lead plaintiff candidates.
The investors in the group submitted a joint declaration explaining that they decided to team up because they all have a big stake in directing the class action. The declaration outlined group members’ plans to work together to oversee plaintiffs lawyers, including through conference calls at least every three months.
The trial judge nevertheless said he had “misgivings” about the group. Logan conceded that the Nikola group was the presumptive lead plaintiff, based on its collective losses. He also found that the group would be an adequate representative for the shareholder class. But he said that trial courts in the 9th Circuit have generally frowned on investor groups with pre-existing relationships. The Nikola group, he said, was composed of people who didn’t know each other and “appear to have joined [together] solely for purposes of litigation.” Logan instead appointed an investor with claimed losses of just $700,000, a small fraction of the group’s claim.
Block & Leviton and Pomerantz filed a mandamus petition asking the 9th Circuit to use this case as a vehicle to refine its guidance on when investor groups can be appointed to lead shareholder class actions.
Mandamus petitions rarely succeed – but this one did. In July, the 9th Circuit vacated Logan’s lead plaintiff order and laid out instructions for how to proceed on remand. Logan went wrong, the appeals court said, by failing to give enough weight to the presumption that the investor group should be named lead. Once he determined that the group would be an adequate representative for the class, the 9th Circuit held, it was up to competing lead plaintiff candidates to prove that the group was not actually capable. Logan erred, the appeals court said, by focusing on the group’s perceived failure to explain its origins.
On remand, the investor group had a strong case for its adequacy, especially, Block said, because individual members of the group had sustained bigger losses than rival candidates. Competing lead counsel from The Rosen Firm asked Logan to hold a hearing to find out whether the investor group had been brought together by Block & Leviton, Pomerantz and other plaintiffs firms but the judge refused.
Even if the group was formed solely to submit a lead plaintiff motion, he said, the joint declaration about members’ plans to oversee the case quelled those concerns. That all-important declaration, he said, “evidences the cohesiveness of the members and their adequacy to serve as lead plaintiff.”
Logan seems to be only the second judge to apply the 9th Circuit’s instructions from the mandamus ruling. In August, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco discussed the ruling in an order appointing two pension funds to lead a securities class action against Fibrogen Inc, but those funds had a pre-existing relationship.
I should point out that, according to Block, there’s a potentially significant caveat to the 9th Circuit decision and Logan’s interpretation: They do not resolve whether investor groups can meet adequacy requirements when their individual losses are smaller than those claimed by a competing lead plaintiff candidate and they can only allege larger losses in combination. The 9th Circuit preserved trial judges’ discretion in that circumstance, Block said, to withhold the lead plaintiff presumption from the investor group.
But if you represent the investor with the biggest alleged losses, teaming up with other shareholders will no longer cast a cloud on your lead plaintiff bid in the 9th Circuit. You don’t have to explain the group’s past as long as your clients are prepared to pledge their future oversight.

623,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden intends to run for re-election in 2024, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday.
Biden, 79, has suffered a dip in his job approval ratings in recent months, leading some Democrats to wonder whether he might not seek another four-year term.
""He is. That's his intention,"" Psaki said as Biden flew aboard Air Force One for a Thanksgiving event with U.S. troops in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
Democrats were rattled by Republican victories in Virginia's state elections earlier this month and a narrow Democratic victory in New Jersey.
Questions have arisen about the viability of Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 should Biden decide not to run again. A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found her with a 28% job approval rating.
Biden underwent his first physical examination on Friday since taking office in January and doctors found he has a stiffened gait and attributed frequent bouts of coughing to acid reflux. Doctors said he was fit to serve.
Biden's political prospects appeared to have been buoyed last week by congressional passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Still being debated is another $2 trillion in spending on a social safety net package.",0
624,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has reached a settlement valued at about $130 million with the families of students and faculty who were killed and injured during the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a source familiar with the talks said on Monday.
The settlement, once finalized, would resolve litigation seeking to hold the FBI accountable for its handling of tips involving the teenage shooter.
Justice Department representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The massacre, one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, left 17 students and staff members dead.
The accused gunman, former Parkland student Nikolas Cruz, pleaded guilty in a Florida courtroom last month to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Cruz, 23, still faces a possible death sentence.
Cruz was 19 and an expelled student at the time of the mass murder.
""Although no resolution could ever restore what the Parkland families lost, this settlement marks an important step toward justice,"" said Kristina Infante of Podhurst Orseck, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a press release.
Some survivors of the Parkland shooting formed March for Our Lives, a gun safety organization that advocates for stricter firearm controls, including stronger background checks and a ban on the type of assault-style rifle that Cruz legally purchased and used in the assault.
Parents of Parkland victims alleged in a 2018 lawsuit that FBI tip line employees acted negligently in their handling of tips regarding Cruz's stated desire to carry out a school shooting and his growing collection of assault-style rifles and ammunition.",0

Biden on Monday renominated Powell, a Republican, to another four-year stint at the helm of the Fed, disappointing Democratic progressives who had pushed the White House to name a tough new regulatory chief to crack down on banks on issues such as climate change and fair lending.  read more 
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, press secretary Jen Psaki said the Fed had taken important steps forward under Powell, including identifying climate change as a key risk that needs to be addressed, working with other central banks to mitigate climate change, and hiring a top climate economist.
""He did reiterate his commitment to that during their discussions,"" Psaki said.
Psaki said Biden hopes to make decisions soon on how he would like to fill the seats that remain open on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.
""He is hoping to make decisions soon,"" she said.
Biden has three other Fed seats to fill, including the vice chair for supervision, and intends to pick those in early December, the White House said earlier Monday.

627,"(Reuters) - New York City’s top homelessness official is leaving his post at the end of the year to oversee the pro bono practice at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm said Monday.
Steven Banks was appointed commissioner of the New York City Department of Social Services in 2014 by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is leaving office in January. As commissioner, Banks heads the city’s Department of Homeless Services and its Human Resources Administration.
From 2004 to 2014, Banks was the attorney-in-chief of the Legal Aid Society in New York, the nation’s largest non-profit legal aid organization.
The New York City Department of Social Services has an annual budget of $12 billion and 16,000 employees serving more than 3 million city residents. Under Banks, the department launched the country’s first right-to-counsel program for low-income tenants. Since 2017, tenants facing eviction who meet certain income requirements qualify for free legal representation in housing court.
The agency has also faced criticism during Banks' tenure. Some advocates say the city hasn't done enough to reduce its homeless population, and its shelter system has come under fire amid allegations of conflicts, mismanagement and abuse by nonprofit shelter operators.
A spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services on Monday said that the agency has made progress in every metric it tracks since 2014, citing declines in the city shelter population and improvements to those facilities.
De Blasio praised Banks' work as commissioner in a statement provided by Paul Weiss, citing his ""unwavering commitment to serving the most disadvantaged and building a fairer city.""
Banks, who is resigning as commissioner Dec. 31, will join Paul Weiss on Feb. 1 as special counsel, the firm said. He will lead the strategy for its pro bono team, which has recently taken on matters ranging from voting rights to COVID-19 assistance.

628,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday upheld the dismissal of a hostile work environment lawsuit by a Black minister against an Ohio church and held that the 1st Amendment's religious protections bar courts from considering some of her claims.
A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati agreed that Rev. Waltrina Middleton failed to plausibly allege that she endured an anti-Black hostile work environment while employed at United Church of Christ.
The church's attorney, Amy Kullik of Mansour Gavin, in a statement said the court ""relied on well-settled law to affirm the decision of the district court to dismiss the case.""
Middleton's lawyer, Matt Hurm of Hurm Law Firm, did not respond to requests for comment.
In a 2019 lawsuit, Middleton claimed she faced a racist hostile work environment while working at the Cleveland-based church in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Middleton said a supervisor said that her being ""a sassy, young, African American woman"" was a problem and asked her to get along with racist people because they gave the church money.
She also claimed the church only considered white candidates to be her supervisor and that, before she was fired, she was demoted and replaced by a white woman.
Middleton did not dispute that she was barred from pursuing a direct challenge to her firing under the so-called ministerial exception, which shields religious organizations from discrimination lawsuits brought by ministerial employees.
But she contended a court could still consider a church's tangible employment actions against a minister, such as a termination or demotion, to support a broader claim of a hostile work environment.
But U.S. Circuit Judge Danny Boggs, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, said courts cannot examine those actions.
""This is precisely the kind of state inquiry into church employment decisions that the First Amendment forbids,"" Boggs wrote.
He said the court did not need to wade into a split among federal appellate courts on whether the ministerial exception also categorically bars a minister’s hostile work environment claims, as Middleton's complaint lacked sufficient allegations.
Boggs was joined in his decision to toss the case by U.S. Circuit Judge Joan Larsen, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, and U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Nelson Moore, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.
But Moore said the majority should have just dismissed the case because of a lack of sufficient allegations and avoided ruling on the ""unnecessary"" ministerial exception aspect of the appeal.
The case is Middleton v. United Church of Christ Board, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-4141.

629,"BUENOS AIRES, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Mavys Alvarez, a Cuban woman who had a relationship with late soccer star Diego Maradona two decades ago, told a news conference on Monday that the Argentine player had raped her when she was a teenager and ""stolen her childhood.""
Alvarez, now 37, gave testimony last week to an Argentine Ministry of Justice court that is investigating her allegations of trafficking against Maradona's former entourage, linked to events when she was 16.
Maradona, widely considered one of the greatest ever soccer stars, died a year ago on Nov. 25, 2020.
The complaint relates to a journey Alvarez took to Argentina with Maradona in 2001, when he was around 40 and she was 16.
Alvarez said that she first met the soccer star shortly before the trip, when he was in Cuba to undergo drug addiction treatment.
At a news conference in Buenos Aires, Alvarez said Maradona had raped her in the clinic in Havana where he was staying, while her mother was in the next room.
""He covers my mouth, he rapes me, I don't want to think about it too much,"" Alvarez said.
""I stopped being a girl, all my innocence was stolen from me. It's hard. You stop living the innocent things that a girl of that age has to experience.""
Matias Morla, Maradona's lawyer before his death, did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not identify other legal representatives for Maradona in the case.
Alvarez has previously described the relationship in media interviews as consensual, but also said that Maradona had at least on one occasion forced himself upon her.
She said that her family had only allowed a relationship with the star to happen, despite the large age gap, because of Maradona's friendship with the late Cuban President Fidel Castro.
""My family would never have accepted it if the Cuban government had not been involved,"" she said. ""They were forced in another way to accept a relationship that was not good for them, or for anyone.""
Cuba's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Alvarez said she had filed the complaint ""in order to help all women, all victims of trafficking, of crime,"" she said. ""To be able to help them in whatever way I can. That's my idea.""
She said it was hard to be back in Argentina, where Maradona remains a hero to many.
""It's hard to be in his country, to see that he is everywhere, he is an idol and at the same time everything I remember about him as a person feels ugly,"" she said.",0

Ukraine had secured a loan deal last year as the country -  one of Europe's poorest - tumbled into recession due to the coronavirus pandemic. But loan disbursal stalled over concerns about reforms and the independence of the central bank.
The latest agreement is a boost for Zelenskiy's government, which is grappling with surging coronavirus cases, higher inflation and growing jitters about Russian troop movements on its eastern borders. 
""Grateful to @IMFNews Board of Governors for the decision to complete the review of the stand-by program on the allocation of a tranche of about $ 700 million,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""We'll use these funds to support the financial system & combat #COVID19 consequences. The IMF program will be continued.""
The IMF said in a statement that its board had agreed to a ""rephasing"" of loan disbursements without giving specifics.
The programme commits Ukraine to keeping its debt sustainable, safeguarding the central bank's independence, bringing inflation back into its target range and tackling corruption, the IMF said.
""Ukraine's IMF supported economic program aims to help the authorities address the effects of the COVID-19 shock, sustain the economic recovery, and move ahead on important structural reforms to reduce key vulnerabilities,"" it said.

Turner led the Revolution to their first-ever Supporters' Shield and a new single-season record with 73 points in 34 matches (22-5-7 record).
Turner, 27, tied for the MLS lead with 17 goalkeeper wins, including five shutouts. He was also named MVP of the MLS All-Star Game after stopping two attempts in the penalty shootout against the Liga MX All-Stars.
He is the first goalkeeper in the Revolution's 26-year MLS history to win the award. Andre Blake of the Philadelphia Union finished second in the voting by MLS players, club technical staff and media.
""It means a lot. It's definitely something that I've had on my radar as a goal, as a box to check if you will, for a long time,"" Turner told reporters in a conference call. ""I've never really been one to win individual awards ... but I really do mean that. All throughout growing up when I was getting into soccer, I always seemed to come in second place in these types of voting things, so I don't feel like this is something that gives me validity, but it certainly is a nice award and one that I'm really proud to have accomplished.""

The senators asked the agency to provide state and local election officials with information on how to use federal election funds to improve security. They also asked it to provide guidance on other resources available ""for identifying and responding to potential threats.""
The letter follows a series of Reuters stories documenting a campaign of fear waged against frontline election administrators inspired by former President Donald Trump's relentless false claims that the 2020 vote was ""rigged"" against him.

635,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected claims by the state of Mississippi that Memphis, Tennessee has illegally ""siphoned"" its groundwater for decades by pumping it from wells located outside the Mississippi border.
In a unanimous decision, the high court shot down Mississippi's argument that Memphis is stealing its water, holding that water both states draw from the Middle Claiborne Aquifer is subject to a doctrine known as equitable apportionment that has previously been applied to the sharing of surface waters.
The ruling ends Mississippi's bid to obtain $615 million in damages.
Mississippi moved to sue Tennessee and Memphis in 2014. It maintained that Memphis had been pumping water subject to Mississippi's sovereign ownership from the Middle Claiborne Aquifer, which spans eight states including Mississippi and Tennessee.
Although Memphis' wells do not cross the border between the states, Mississippi argued that the utility's pumping caused water located beneath its territory to be pulled into Tennessee. Mississippi said it had lost, as a result, more than 400 billion gallons of groundwater between 1965 and 2016.
In Monday's ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that while some of the aquifer falls under Mississippi's jurisdiction, the water it contains is not owned exclusively by the state, as it contends. Rather, the ""flowing interstate waters"" are subject to the equitable apportionment doctrine, which applies to the allocation of shared water resources between two or more states, the judge wrote.
Roberts said the case marked the first time the Supreme Court has held that an interstate aquifer is subject to the doctrine. It had previously been applied to cases involving surface water like rivers and streams.
Susannah Williams, a spokesperson with the Office of the Mississippi Attorney General, said that her office ""respect(s) the decision of the Court.""
David Frederick, a lawyer representing Tennessee, said that the court had ""upheld the important principle that States share interstate water resources, even if they are underground.""
The Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division pumps about 120 million gallons of groundwater from the Middle Claiborne Aquifer each day, using more than 160 wells located in and around Memphis.
Simulations conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey have found that water levels in large swathes of the Middle Claiborne Aquifer could decline substantially by 2038, largely due to water being pumped at unsustainable rates.
The case is Mississippi v. Tennessee, City of Memphis, Tennessee, and Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 22O143.

637,"BRUNSWICK, Ga., Nov 22 (Reuters) - A jury heard dueling accounts of whether the three white men charged with murdering Ahmaud Arbery had any right to chase and shoot the unarmed Black man in their mostly white Georgia neighborhood in closing arguments on Monday.
Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35; and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment, saying they did nothing wrong in jumping into pickup trucks to chase Arbery.
Prosecutors said the men ""assumed the worst"" about a 25-year-old Black man running by their homes and attacked him in a five-minute pursuit through Satilla Shores, a coastal Georgia suburb, on Feb. 23, 2020.
In contrast, the elder McMichael's lawyer, Laura Hogue, said the defendants had a duty to catch Arbery, whom she painted as a frightening burglar with ""long dirty toenails,"" using a description from the autopsy report.
At that comment, Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, was heard exclaiming ""Wow!"" as she rose to leave the room.
Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said the defendants killed Arbery, an avid jogger, ""not because he's a threat to them, but because he wouldn't stop and talk to them."" Arbery had nothing on him but his jogging clothes and shoes.
""They made their decision to attack Ahmaud Arbery in their driveways because he was a Black man running down the street,"" she said, the prosecution's most direct assertion so far of a racist motivation in a case which mentioned race only in passing before the jury.
The younger McMichael was the only defendant to take the stand, testifying he fired his shotgun at close range at Arbery in self defense, saying Arbery had grabbed the gun.
In his closing argument, Jason Sheffield, one of McMichael's lawyers, pointed to the law-enforcement training McMichael got during his nine years as a U.S. Coast Guard mechanic.
Sheffield showed jurors parts of Bryan's widely seen cellphone video, freezing it at the moment Arbery ran towards Travis McMichael, who had just aimed his shotgun at Arbery.
""There's no question that Ahmaud's hands are on this gun,"" he said. ""You are allowed to defend yourself. You are allowed to use force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury if you believe it's necessary. At that moment, Travis believed it is necessary.""
'A GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD'
Dunikoski suggested McMichael lied on the stand, deriding his testimony as self-serving and inconsistent with initial accounts to police.
McMichael testified that he thought Arbery might have been behind local thefts and that he briefly saw Arbery 12 days before the shooting outside a nearby empty, half-built house after dark.
No evidence ever emerged that Arbery, who was saving money to return to technical college, took anything on his frequent runs through Satilla Shores. The property owner said through a lawyer he believed Arbery was stopping for a drink from a water faucet on the site.
Nonetheless, Hogue argued, Arbery had an intent to steal in his repeated visits to the construction site at night, which can be prosecuted as burglary even if nothing is taken. Her argument sometimes drew shocked muttering from Arbery's supporters.
""A beautiful teenager with a broad smile and a crooked baseball cap can deteriorate and lose his way,"" Hogue said, referring to a photograph of Arbery that prosecutors showed jurors. ""Years later he can end up creeping into a home that is not his own and running away.""
The defendants have argued that they had a right to detain Arbery under Georgia's citizen's arrest law, which was repealed in the wake of outrage over the killing.
""A good neighborhood is always policing itself,"" Hogue said.
The citizen's arrest law allowed anyone to detain a person if there is reasonable and probable suspicion that the person is fleeing a serious felony crime they committed.
But trespassing is a misdemeanor, Dunikoski noted, and none of the defendants knew where Arbery had been or what he was doing before running past their driveways.
Kevin Gough described his client, Bryan, as a simple, ineloquent hardware store worker who was the only one of the three men not to grab a gun before chasing Arbery.
""Roddie Bryan is no vigilante,"" Gough said. He evoked the ""hand of God"" as he argued that Bryan was being ""guided by divine providence"" to the scene so that the jury could have the most important evidence in the case: Bryan's cellphone video.
For the felony murder charges, the prosecution does not have to show that anyone intended to kill Arbery. They only need to prove that the men falsely imprisoned him or assaulted him using the shotgun and their trucks, and that one of those underlying felonies caused Arbery's death.

U.S. District Judge John Gibney of the Eastern District of Virginia in Richmond also ordered Matson, 64, to pay a $10,000 fine, according to the DOJ.
Matson was accused of lying to a DOJ watchdog that was probing his alleged misappropriation of funds from title insurer LandAmerica Financial Group's bankruptcy.
Prosecutors had requested 46 months in prison and a $250,000 fine, while Matson's attorneys requested a 37-month sentence.
Richard Cullen and Brandon Santos, McGuireWoods attorneys representing Matson, did not immediately return requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.
LandAmerica, one of the largest title insurance groups in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Virginia in 2008.
Matson, was assigned the role of liquidation trustee for the company's remaining assets while at LeClairRyan. He was found to have embezzled approximately $800,000 from the trust between 2015 and 2018, and misappropriated a total of $4 million, according to court papers.
According to prosecutors, in 2019 Matson lied to the U.S. Trustee probing the depleted trust funds, telling them he moved the funds because of high bank fees and tax identification issues. Matson agreed to disbarment in November 2020.
On Friday, Matson submitted 51 letters of support from family, friends and colleagues to Gibney. His lawyers in their argument for a shorter sentence said Matson experienced a ""tremendous fall from grace,"" and had been a respected bankruptcy attorney for more than three decades.
Matson's former firm, Richmond-headquartered LeClairRyan filed for Chapter 11 protection in September 2019, after decreasing revenues and a spate of partner departures.
The case is United States v. Matson, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, No. 21-cr-00079.
For the United States: Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Garnett and former Assistant U.S. Attorneys Katherine Martin and Kevin Elliker
For Matson: Brandon Santos and Richard Cullen of McGuireWoods; and Danny Onorato of Schertler Onorato Mead & Sears

POWELL NOMINATION LEADS TO GROWTH STOCK POW! BAM! WHAM! (1607 EST/2107 GMT)
Major U.S. indexes rallied out of the gate on Monday after President Joe Biden tapped Fed-Chair Jerome Powell to lead the central bank for a second term.
That said, futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate indicated that money markets are now expecting the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points by next June versus a previous estimate of July.
With this, the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield  jumped around eight basis points putting it back in the 1.62% area, and the major indexes saw early strength evaporate. By the close, the S&P 500 (.SPX), and Nasdaq (.IXIC) both had formed key-reversal days. This after gapping to new highs at the open, and then finishing below Friday's lows.
The Dow Industrials (.DJI) closed just slightly higher, while transports (.DJT), and banks (.SPXBK) surged.
While value was Batman, growth stocks proved to be the Joker. S&P 500 growth (.IGX) took its biggest hit relative to S&P 500 value (.IVX) in more than six months!
Chips (.SOX), FANGs (.NYFANG), and small caps (.RUT)all got punched hard and ended the day in the red.

INVESTORS MAY WANT TO TAKE A ""BEV"" OUT FOR A SPIN (1356 EST/1856 GMT)
In her latest weekly market commentary, Saira Malik, CIO, head of global equities at Nuveen, takes a look at battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
Malik admits that BEVs are ""by no means new to the automotive lexicon,"" although they remain a small percentage of cars on the road. However, she says BEVs are well on their way to becoming mainstream, as global economies from the U.S. to the EU to China are making commitments to sustainability across the auto industry.
In fact, she says nearly all major traditional car manufacturers ""have begun to pledge a transition from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to BEVs over the next two decades for significant portions of their fleets.""
According to Malik, BEVs offer several advantages, from better performance and internet connectivity to environmental benefits. As a result, volume buyers such as car rental and shipping/logistic companies are already transferring orders away from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to their BEV counterparts.
As Malik sees it, over the longer-term, the impact of these purchases will ripple across used-car markets, ultimately depressing the value of pre-owned ICEs.
Still, she cautions that the near-term outlook for BEV-related equities may be inhibited by extended valuations, as well as by rising rates. However, looking forward, Nuveen believes the prospects for BEV makers are ""bright,"" as the number of entrants to the market increases and the costs to consumers become more competitive with existing ICE price tags — ""something we expect to see over the next 3 to 5 years.""
Additionally, she says that investors may want to consider exposure to BEV component manufacturers given that ""BEVs require twice as many of their inputs as do their ICE counterparts.""

S&P 500 YEAR-END 2022 TARGET 5,100 - GOLDMAN (1307 EST/18507 GMT)
In Goldman Sachs' (GS) latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart note, David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist, is highlighting his S&P 500 (.SPX) year-end 2022 target of 5,100.
He says this represents a 9% price gain from Friday and a total return with dividends of 10%. He says their 3-month and 6-month interim targets are 4,850 (+3%) and 5,000 (+6%) and reflect a supportive equity investment backdrop GS anticipates during 1H.
With this, Kostin offers three recommendations:
(1) Supply chains are starting to normalize and cyclical equities including “reopening” stocks should outperform
(2) Labor market tightness will persist and investors should skip firms with high labor costs relative to EBIT
(3) Bond yields will rise so fast-growing stocks valued entirely on long-term growth expectations would be vulnerable to rising rates or disappointing sales compared with growth stocks that enjoy high margins.

NASDAQ FLIPS TO RED AS GROWTH NAMES TUMBLE (1221 EST/1721 GMT)
The Nasdaq's (.IXIC) early push to a record high completely evaporated as of mid-day trading on Monday, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) also gave back a large portion of its early rise.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had climbed after President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lead the central bank for a second term, with Wall Street lenders rallying on the prospect of interest rate hikes in 2022.
The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield  was also popping back up to the 1.60% area.

EXISTING HOME SALES: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN (1120 EST/1620 GMT)
Investors began Thanksgiving week by thanking President Joe Biden for keeping Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's steady hand on the tiller of monetary policy, and also expressing gratitude for a bit of better-than-expected economic data in the form of existing home sales.
For the last few months, the housing market has been the has-been of the economic recovery, falling victim to its early stardom.
Mandated lock downs initially sparked a stampede to the suburbs, launching demand - along with home prices - to the moon, a phenomenon resulting in the prospect of home ownership drifting beyond the realm of affordability for many potential buyers.
But the sector has recently shown signs of returning to an even keel.
Sales of pre-owned U.S. homes rose by 0.8% last month to 6.34 million units at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
The number came in 140,000 units above consensus and marked a slight acceleration from September's 0.7% gain.
The uptick helped keep the inventory of homes on the market steady at 2.3 months supply - below the historical average but up from the record low of 1.8 months reached last December.
""Home sales remain resilient, despite low inventory and increasing affordability challenges,"" writes Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist at NAR.
Yun also points out that just as the sector benefited from the pandemic's initial onset, it could be experiencing a second wind due to the current inflation wave.
""Inflationary pressures, such as fast-rising rents and increasing consumer prices, may have some prospective buyers seeking the protection of a fixed, consistent mortgage payment,"" he says.
The easing credit environment has also lent some support, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""For mortgaged buyers, the rebound in sales has been supported by lower rates since their spring peak, and a clear easing in lending standards,"" Shepherdson notes.
The NAR print falls neatly inline with other recent housing data, particularly the 4% increase in building permits and a rebound in homebuilder sentiment, both released last week.
While economic data holds a rear view mirror to recent activity, the stock market provides a forward-looking indicator, reflecting where investors see the housing sector six months to a year down the road.
Housing stocks - namely the Philadelphia SE Housing index (.HGX) and the S&P 1500 Home Building index (.SPCOMHOME) - handily outperformed the broader market as the global health crisis took its toll.
But as illustrated by the graphic below, over the last 12 months the HGX and the SPCOMHOME indexes are now essentially neck-and-neck with the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX).
Wall Street has grown greener as the morning progresses, with all three major indexes notching healthy gains in a broad rally.
Small caps (.RUT), chips (.SOX) and transports (.DJT) are leading the charge, all signs of economic optimism.

BANK SHARES CHEER LOUDEST FOR POWELL SECOND TERM (1050 EST/1550 GMT)
Shares of the biggest U.S. bank stocks (.SPXBK) are outperforming the broader market on Monday after the White House said it would nominate current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term while for vice chair, it picked Lael Brainard, the Fed board member who was seen as the other main contender for the top job.  read more 
""There's some consensus on the Street that Brainard is pretty far left of Powell in terms of her political views and would be a lot tougher on the banks via regulation and via scrutiny around mergers and acquisition activity,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York which specializes in trading financial stocks.
""It's a little bit of an initial relief rally that Powell is a little bit more of a Wall Street friendly choice.""
While Biden has yet to fill three Fed seats, including vice chair for supervision, a key role for bank regulation, investors seemed confident that Powell would be able to set the tone for regulation.
Grant said it was somewhat unusual for a Fed chair to be re-nominated by a Democratic president after being originally signed up by a Republican president.
""He's found a way to kind of navigate both sides of the aisle pretty well. And I think there's a quorum that he's a strong leader during a tough time."" he said.
""He's been the leader of the Fed during a very tumultuous time with COVID. He navigated the (former President Donald) Trump situation fairly well, which was sloppy and nasty at times,"" said Grant. ""People just generally feel better about the direction of the economy under Powell.""
The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) is up 2.4% and on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 23. Among the biggest percentage gainers in the group are SVB Financial (SIVB.O), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and People United Financial (PBCT.O).

POWELL NOMINATION RELIEVES U.S. STOCK INVESTORS (1010 EST/1510 GMT)
The three major U.S. stock indexes are solidly higher in morning New York trading, with the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) hitting record highs, as President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to head the central bank for a second term.
Investors appeared to be cheering the news as a second term for Powell could soothe some worries over a change in the status quo.
The rate-sensitive S&P 500 financials (.SPSY) are up more than 1% and leading sector gains along with technology (.SPLRCT), also up more than 1%.
""My reaction is one of relief. He was a steady hand, I think people liked in general the policies that he enacted since Covid first became an issue,"" said Peter Tuz, president at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

U.S. SHARE BUYBACKS HIT RECORD IN Q3 (0921 EST/1421 GMT)
S&P 500 (.SPX) companies have made record quarterly share repurchases in Q3 2021, amounting to $225 billion, topping the previous record of $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.
Given the annual record of $806 billion set in 2019, a December quarter buyback as well as the remaining unreported Q3 of $204 billion in repurchases would set a new annual record, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note on Saturday. The 12-month high is $823 billion, set in the 12-months ending in March, 2019.
""At this point, I've penciled in a new annual record, with a new 12-month record being in the works,"" Silverblatt said.
Buybacks have roared back this year after bottoming out at $89 billion in the second quarter of last year as the U.S. economy shutdown due to the pandemic.

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT)
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.
Meanwhile, the IXIC ended at an all-time high on Friday. That makes 46 record closes so far in 2021 vs 55 for all of last year.
However, one measure of the Composite's internal strength has once again broken down:
After hitting a high of 75.7% earlier this month, which was well shy of its 2021 peaks, the Nasdaq New High/New Low (NH/NL) index fell to 53.3% on Friday. That was its weakest reading, with the IXIC at a record close, since Aug. 30. Back then, five trading days later, the Composite topped and then slid as much as 8% into its October trough.
Of note, just since early 2020, there have been five sharp IXIC declines from record high-territory, averaging about 15%, all of which were preceded by multi-week/multi-month NH/NL index divergence.
Unless this measure can at least reclaim its descending 10-day moving average, the risk is that it continues to trend down to test the 2020 trough, which was at 1.2%.
Additionally of note, last week saw three Hindenburg Omens triggered on the Nasdaq, and two on the NYSE Composite (.NYA). 
These clusters can highlight an especially fractured market, vulnerable to instability.

640,"BOSTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A Massachusetts judge on Monday dismissed indictments against two former leaders of a veterans home who were charged with criminal neglect for their roles in handling a COVID-19 outbreak that killed 76 people.
The criminal case against former Holyoke Soldiers' Home Superintendent Bennett Walsh and former Medical Director David Clinton was believed to be the first in the nation tied to a COVID-19 outbreak at a U.S. nursing facility.
The outbreak at the Soldiers' Home, a 247-bed, state-run facility in Holyoke that provides healthcare, nursing and other services to veterans, was one of the deadliest to occur at a U.S. nursing facility.
Michael Jennings, Walsh's lawyer, said he was ""certainly happy the judge agreed with our arguments,"" while noting the case was not over, as the state could appeal.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's office, which brought the charges, is evaluating its options, said spokesperson Jillian Fennimore.
""We are very disappointed in today's ruling, especially on behalf of the innocent victims and families harmed by the defendants' actions,"" she said.
The case stemmed from a March 2020 decision to consolidate two dementia units, which Healey said put COVID-19 positive residents within feet of ones without symptoms.
Walsh and Clinton were charged in September 2020 with five counts of elder neglect and five counts of permitting serious bodily injury to an elder.
Those charges concerned five specific veterans whom Justice Edward McDonough in Hampden County Superior Court said had already been exposed to COVID-19 before the merger.
""There was insufficient reasonably trustworthy evidence presented to the grand jury that, had these two dementia units not been merged, the medical condition of these five veterans would have been materially different,"" McDonough wrote.
He said Walsh and Clinton also did not fit the definition of ""caretakers"" under the state's elder abuse law.",0

642,"SHANGHAI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai's video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach did not address or alleviate concerns about her well-being, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) said on Monday.
The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one, became a matter of international concernfor nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.
She appeared at a dinner with friends on Saturday and a children's tennis tournament in Beijing on Sunday, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media journalists and by the tournament's organisers show. But they have done little to quell concerns.
""It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don't alleviate or address the WTA's concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,"" a WTA spokeswoman said in an e-mail.
Asked about the call with the IOC, the spokeswoman said: ""This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.""
The IOC said in a statement that Peng held a 30-minute call with Bach on Sunday during which she said she was safe and well at home in Beijing and wanted to have her privacy respected for now.
Amnesty International's China researcher Alkan Akad told Reuters the video call did little to ease fears over Peng's wellbeing.
""The International Olympic Committee is entering dangerous waters,"" Akad said. ""In the past we have seen various similar cases where people had no option but to say what they had been told to.""
The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to an email request on Monday for comment on the Amnesty statement.
DIPLOMATIC BOYCOTT
The White House, weighing a possible diplomatic boycottof next year's Winter Olympics over what Washington says is China's genocide against minority Muslims, something that Beijing denies, said last week it was concerned about Peng and joined calls for Beijing to provide proof of her whereabouts.
Asked if there were concerns about the safety of U.S. athletes at the Beijing Games and if Peng's disappearance meant it was time to call for a diplomatic boycott, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was closely monitoring her situation.
""We share the concern that has been expressed around the world as we all want her of course to be safe,"" he told a regular briefing, adding that individuals should be allowed to speak freely and seek accountability for sexual assault.
Price said China had ""a zero tolerance approach for criticism and a record of silencing or attempting to silence those who do attempt to speak out.""
French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu ""is partly reassured by the video but remains concerned and wants the light to be shed on the accusations of sexual assault"", her office told Reuters.
France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday that Chinese authorities should let Peng speak publicly.
""I'm expecting only one thing: that she speaks,"" Le Drian told LCI television, adding that there could be unspecified diplomatic consequences if China did not clear up the situation.
Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics over China's human rights record.
The WTA has also threatened to pull tournaments out of China over the matter.  read more 
Hu Xijin, the editor of China's state-owned Global Times who has in recent days posted videos and photographs of Peng in Beijing, said on Twitter on Monday that her appearance should be enough to ease worries of ""those who truly care about (the) safety of Peng Shuai.
""But for those aiming to attack China’s system and boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics, facts, no matter how many, don't work for them,"" he said.
On Nov. 2, Peng posted on Chinese social media that Zhang had coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship. The post was deleted about half hour after it was posted.
#WhereIsPengShuai?
Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on Peng's allegations. China’s State Council Information office did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Monday.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, when asked on Monday about the concerns over Peng expressed by France, Britain and the United States, said it was not a foreign ministry matter but noted that Peng had recently attended public activities.
Current and former tennis players, including Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams and Billie Jean King, have also joined the calls seeking to confirm she was safe, using the social media hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai?
Men's singles world No.1 Novak Djokovic said it would be strange to hold tournaments in China unless the ""horrific"" situation was resolved.
The topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet and the comments sections on all remaining posts on Peng's official Weibo account, and on numerous old posts by users about her, have been locked.
Some Weibo users have found ways around the censors by leaving comments on accounts belonging to foreign tennis players or sports commentators. While a number expressed relief to see her re-appear at the weekend, others said they were sceptical.

643,"FORT BRAGG, N.C., Nov 22 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, on Monday helped serve Thanksgiving meals to U.S. troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, thanking them for their service and dedication to country.
Biden told the service members he knew how much their loved ones missed them, especially during holiday celebrations, reflecting on his son Beau's service in the U.S. Army in Iraq and Kosovo before his death of cancer in 2015.
""I know how hard it is to have someone who's not at the table,"" Biden told the hundreds of troops before donning an apron with a presidential seal and doling out stuffing. ""You do so much and your families give so much.""
Biden said he was ""damn proud"" to serve as commander in chief of what he called the finest military ""the world has ever seen.""
It was Biden's first visit to Fort Bragg since becoming president in January. He was joined at the event by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.
The first lady also invoked Beau Biden's memory, telling the troops, ""We're so grateful for everything that you do. And Joe and I feel like, you know, you're family to us. And we cannot thank you enough.""
Before leaving the base, Biden met with special operations forces who often serve as the ""tip of the spear"" in U.S. military operations, the White House said.
Biden joins many of his predecessors in spending some time with the troops during the holiday season.
Since he has withdrawn troops from Afghanistan and is set to end the U.S. combat mission in Iraq by year's end, Biden chose to visit U.S. forces within the United States rather than go abroad.
Former presidents including Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush all traveled to visit troops in either Iraq or Afghanistan during the holiday season.
Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan prompted a chaotic withdrawal that has been heavily criticized.
Many troops who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan have been stationed at Fort Bragg.
Biden on Tuesday will travel to Nantucket, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, to spend Thanksgiving with his family,  resuming a decades-long tradition that was interrupted last year due to the pandemic. He spent the holiday at his Delaware home with family instead.",0

The SEC's order said Redman charged ProPetro $380,594 worth of personal and travel expenses unrelated to the performance of his duties as CEO and failed to disclose stock pledges for two private real estate transactions, the regulator said in a statement.
Redman resigned from ProPetro last year less than three weeks after Reuters sent company executives a letter seeking comments for an investigation into the stock pledges and other aspects of his financial affairs.
The investigation by the SEC found that between January 2017 and December 2018, Redman and his family members used corporate credit cards for roughly $127,698 in undocumented and personal expenses. The company also incurred $252,896 in charges related to Redman's personal use of an aircraft.
Redman has agreed to pay a $195,046 as part of the settlement.  He is currently listed as a manger on a company called Commander Downhole Technologies, which was formed on Aug. 27, 2021, according to a Texas business filing.

Islamic State (IS), which is allied with an anti-Uganda rebel group - Allied Democratic Forces (ADF)- claimed responsibility for the Nov. 16 attack, which killed seven people, including the three bombers, and injured dozens more. One police officer was among the 4 others killed and 27 out 37 wounded were also police officers.
""To disrupt and dismantle acts of domestic terrorism, we have intensified operations. Since these operations began, a total of 106 suspects have been arrested,"" police spokesperson Fred Enanga said in a statement posted on Facebook.
Police did not provide details on how the seven suspects were killed.
In last week's attack, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance of a police station in the centre of Kampala. Three minutes later two other suicide bombers exploded along a road that leads to the parliament.
The explosions set vehicles alight, and sent glass shards flying and panicked officers and workers fleeing multi-storied buildings.
Enanga said those detained ""included those who were involved in terrorist financing and persons who were involved in mobilisation and incitement of vulnerable Ugandans into the ranks of ADF.""
""We are actively monitoring all spaces in homes, places of worship, which are acting as domains for recruitment and as collection centres, for children who are introduced to ideological messages and beliefs,"" Enanga said.
A security raid on a suspected radicalisation centre in central Uganda had found 22 young people who security personnel suspects were being prepared for recruitment into ADF, he added.
The ADF was founded by Ugandan Muslims in 1990s and initially waged a war against the Ugandan government from bases in the country's west.
They were eventually routed and fled into eastern Congo where they have been operating since, with the U.N. blaming them for thousands of civilian deaths.",0
650,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications Inc's (ZM.O) third-quarter revenue growth rate slowed to 35% as demand for its video-conferencing tools eased from the pandemic-fueled heights last year, sending its shares down about 6% on Monday.
Revenue was at $1.05 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31, Zoom said, after rising 54% in the previous quarter and surging 360% a year earlier.
The stock, a pandemic winner, fell to $227.5 in extended trading, after having lost about 28% this year.
Moreover, stiff competition posed by Cisco's (CSCO.O) conferencing tool Webex and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Teams has made it challenging for Zoom to win over enterprise customers.
To retain its users, the company launched a variety of new offerings such as Events platform, where businesses can host large-scale conferences, cloud-calling service Zoom Phone and in-office meetings feature Zoom Rooms.
""Their Rooms and Phone businesses are 5% penetrated or below and that seems to imply plenty of remaining runway for growth even within their existing capabilities only,"" said Joe McCormack, senior analyst at Third Bridge said.
Investment bankers and analysts have warned that Zoom faces several hurdles in sustaining growth after its $14.7 billion bid to buy call center software firm Five9 Inc (FIVN.O) fell through.  read more

""I have resigned from Netflix as of 11/21/2021. This isn’t how I thought things would end, but I am relieved to have closure,"" Terra Field said in a statement posted online.
Chappelle's latest Netflix comedy special ""The Closer"" was criticized by some who saw it as a ridicule of transgender people. Supporters of the comedian viewed it as a cry against cancel culture.
Field and a former colleague, B. Pagels-Minor, are withdrawing an unfair labor practice charge they filed against Netflix in late October that accused the company of retaliating against them for trying to organize a company-wide walkout over Chappelle's Netflix special.
""We have resolved our differences in a way that acknowledges the erosion of trust on both sides and, we hope, enables everyone to move on,"" Netflix spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Monday.
Neither side immediately responded to requests for further comment, including about whether there was a financial settlement in the case.
""My clients have resolved their differences with Netflix and will be voluntarily withdrawing their NLRB charge,"" Laurie Burgess, a labor lawyer representing Pagels-Minor and Field, said in a statement quoted by NBC News.
Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos had acknowledged Chappelle's provocative language in ""The Closer"" but said it did not cross the line into inciting violence.
In October, Pagels-Minor was fired while organizing the walkout after the company said Pagels-Minor had leaked confidential information, which the employee denied.",0

653,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Americans have begun hitting the roads and skies in large numbers in advance of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday as weather so far looks favorable for travel plans.
On Sunday, the Transportation Security Administration screened 2.21 million U.S air passengers, the fourth consecutive day with checkpoint volume topping 2 million.
The TSA said Friday was the single busiest air travel day since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, with  2.24 million travelers screened.
AccuWeather said Monday that ""a largely quiet weather pattern should prevent widespread travel worries from the weather ahead of Thanksgiving.""
The weather forecaster added that ""some Americans could still face minor weather-related delays during one of the busiest travel periods of the year - and weather for the trip home may be a different story.""
As vaccination rates have risen, many Americans are traveling for the holidays after skipping family gatherings last November and December.
Travel group AAA forecasts 53.4 million people will travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, up 13% from 2020, with most travelers going by car. About 48.3 million Thanksgiving travelers are expected to go by car, up from 47.1 million last year, but still below 2019's 49.9 million.
Those on the roads will face gasoline prices hovering near the highest since 2014, and the high prices likely will prompt some Americans not to make holiday trips.
Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said some Americans ""are responding to the prices by slamming the car door shut and staying off the road.""
TSA expects to screen about 20 million air passengers during the busy Thanksgiving travel period, compared with nearly 26 million in the same period in 2019.
""We are ready,"" TSA Administrator David Pekoske told reporters on Friday at Washington Reagan National Airport. ""We will be able to handle the passenger volumes that we anticipate seeing.""
Airlines have ramped up staffing and offered bonuses and other incentives to employees facing the busy holiday travel season.
Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it expects to fly up to 5.6 million passengers from Friday through Nov. 30, nearly 300% over 2020's 2.2 million Delta passengers for the period but still below the 6.3 million passengers during the same period in 2019.
United Airlines  said it anticipates more than 4.5 million passengers during the Thanksgiving travel period - about 88% of 2019 volume.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby told Skift last week he has confidence in the airline's ability to fly its holiday schedule. ""We've left ourselves a margin of error,"" Kirby said.
He cautioned, however, that problems can ripple and ""If you are not careful it can cascade into a meltdown.""
Some airlines have in recent weeks faced weather issues, resulting in hundreds of daily cancellations over several days.
United said it was adding about 700 domestic flights for Thanksgiving week, and would fly 87% of its 2019 domestic schedule in November.",0
654,"BRUSSELS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The EU has drafted legislation to reduce methane emissions by forcing oil and gas companies to report their output and find and fix leaks of the gas that is the second-biggest cause of climate change, according to a draft seen by Reuters on Monday.
Oil and gas operators in the European Union would have to submit estimates for the methane emissions of their installations within 12 months after the regulation comes into force, the draft legislative proposal said.
The European Commission is due to present the draft in December and it is still subject to change.  read more 
Once proposed by the Commission, the regulation needs to be negotiated by the European Parliament and member states, a process that can take up to two years.
Two years after the regulation takes effect, operators would be required to report actual measurements of the emissions. They would also have to carry out regular surveys for the detection of methane leaks and their repair.
Brussels has faced pressure from campaigners and some investors to clamp down on methane emissions associated with imported gas, by forcing companies abroad to fix methane leaks to sell their gas into Europe - a requirement that was not included in the draft proposal.
Methane is emitted from sources including leaky fossil fuel infrastructure, livestock farming and landfill sites.
It has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 but it breaks down in the atmosphere faster, meaning deep cuts in methane emissions by 2030 could have a rapid impact on slowing global warming.",0
655,"SAO PAULO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A Brazilian coffee co-op received a price premium in its first  sale of a batch of carbon-neutral arabica coffee that was near double that a product certified as sustainable but not carbon-neutral would achieve, officials at the company said.
In its first shipment of its kind, through coffee trader Volcafe with Japan the final destination, Brazilian coffee co-op monteCCer sold 300 60-kg bags of coffee for around 100 reais ($17.89) per bag more than it would receive by selling regular certified coffee.
Regis Damasio Salles, a director at monteCCer, said that five other deals were about to be closed with similar gains in price. A large U.S. coffee retailer, which he did not name, is among the interested buyers.
Because coffee plants are perennial, coffee plantations serve as carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the air.
In the project developed by monteCCer, a group of farmers followed techniques to further reduce emissions, resulting in a harvest that is neutral or even negative in terms of carbon emissions.
The techniques included more efficient use of fertilizers, particularly nitrogen-based, the use of biological products rather than chemicals and reduced use of power and water, with advanced irrigation, such as underground dripping systems.
Brazil's NGO Imaflora was one of the advisers for the program under which 34 farms in the Cerrado region in Minas Gerais produced coffee that was neutral or carbon negative.
Those farms produce around 160,000 bags of coffee, a relatively small volume compared with the total Brazilian production of nearly 50 million bags in 2021.
At United Nations talks in Britain this month to try to slow global warming, Brazil said it was raising its climate commitments, although the evidence so far is that President Jair Bolsonaro has not halted destruction of the rain forest  read more

656,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Monday it has approved Verizon Communications Inc's (VZ.N) more than $6 billion acquisition of pre-paid mobile phones provider TracFone Wireless with conditions to protect low-income consumers.
The FCC's announcement followed the California Public Utilities Commission's approval of the deal last Thursday after Verizon agreed to additional consumer-protection conditions. Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers. TracFone, a unit of Mexican telecom company America Movil (AMXL.MX), serves more than 20 million customers.
Verizon said in September 2020 it would buy TracFone in a $6.25 billion cash and stock deal with up to $650 million in potential additional future payments.
FCC approval should allow the deal to close as soon as Wednesday.
The FCC said required conditions will protect low-income consumers from price increases and require the company to continue to participate in a low-income telecommunications subsidy program called Lifeline. The agency will require an internal and an independent compliance officer ""empowered to proactively monitor conditions, ensure that low-income consumers are not being harmed, and facilitate consumer complaints about potential violations.""
Verizon welcomed the FCC's approval, saying the deal would ""provide customers with the best of both worlds: more choices, better services and new features.""
The deal was approved by the Justice Department last year.
Under the California agreement, TracFone or Verizon must participate in Lifeline for 20 years.
TracFone is one of the largest providers in the Lifeline program, with 1.7 million low-income subscribers in 43 states and the District of Columbia.
Verizon said it has committed to participate in Lifeline for at least seven years and will offer existing TracFone Lifeline rate plans for at least three years.
Lifeline in total provides 9.1 million Americans with free or discounted broadband and voice services.
Democratic U.S. senators Richard Blumenthal, Sheldon Whitehouse, Dianne Feinstein, Ron Wyden and Edward Markey said the ""FCC’s binding conditions on Verizon’s acquisition of TracFone can have real-life benefits for consumers — if they’re vigorously followed and enforced.""",0
657,"NEW DELHI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - New Delhi has lifted a ban on construction activities as air quality improved marginally, but schools and offices will remain closed until at least Wednesday, its environment minister said on Monday.
Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) dropped to 303 on a scale of 500, down from 499 nearly a week ago, when a thick haze hung over the city of more than 200 million people. The current AQI levels still indicate ""very poor"" conditions, according to government monitoring agencies.
""Air quality is slowly improving,"" Gopal Rai, the capital's Minister for Environment, Forest and Wildlife Development, told a news conference. ""Labourers were facing difficulties, and that is why we have decided to resume construction activities.""
He said the authorities would monitor construction sites to ensure that builders follow dust-control measures set out by the government.
In an interview with Reuters late last week, Rai said the city would consider restricting private vehicles to driving on alternate days if severe air pollution continued to plague India's capital. 
Apart from banning construction, the city government had also shut schools and offices, allowing people to work from home.
Rai told the news conference the authorities would review the city's air quality on Nov. 24 and then decide whether to reopen schools and offices.
""We are closely monitoring,"" the minister said. He also urged residents to use public transport.
Vehicular emissions contributed to more than half of Delhi's air pollution between Oct. 24-Nov. 8, the Centre for Science and Environment think tank said earlier this month.

658,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday nominated Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term, positioning the former investment banker to continue the most consequential revamp of monetary policy since the 1970s and finish guiding the economy out of the pandemic crisis.
Lael Brainard, the Federal Reserve board member who was the other top candidate for the job, will be vice chair, the White House said. 
Combined, the nominations pair two monetary policy veterans and collaborators on a recent overhaul of Fed policy, which shifted the emphasis to jobs from the preeminent focus on inflation established some four decades ago. Their challenge will be to keep U.S. job growth underway while also ensuring recent strong inflation doesn't become entrenched.
“We’ve gone from an economy that was shut down to an economy that's leading the world in economic growth,” Biden said in remarks at the White House with the nominees.
Citing Powell’s “steady leadership” that calmed panicked markets, and his belief in monetary policies that support maximum employment, Biden said ""I believe Jay is the right person to see us through.""
The United States is still dealing with the impacts of the pandemic, including inflation, he said but the country has made “enormous progress” including adding nearly 6 million jobs since he was sworn in and increasing wages - positive signs that are a testament to the Federal Reserve.
""I respect Jay's independence,"" Biden said, directly addressing critics from his own Democratic party who wanted him to bump Powell, a Republican, for a Democrat. ""At this moment of both enormous potential and enormous uncertainty for our economy, we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve.""
Powell, 68, and Brainard, 59, will both need to be confirmed in their Fed leadership roles by the Senate, currently controlled by Biden's Democratic party but closely divided. The president has for now left open several other Fed positions, including that of vice chair for supervision, that he may fill as soon as next month and that could be used to toughen bank regulation, improve diversity, and make other changes his supporters have urged for the Fed. 
But for the Fed's core monetary policy - managing inflation and setting interest rates as the economy reopens from the pandemic - Biden opted for continuity.
""They are veterans and mature public servants and there has been very little difference between them” on monetary policy said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Together Powell, a moderate Republican elevated by former President Donald Trump, and Brainard, who served in prior Democratic administrations, ""gives potentially non-partisan credibility to a more realistic assessment of inflation risks"" the United States faces.
That reassessment could mean interest rate increases coming sooner than later if inflation, which both promised to fight, proves more persistent than expected.
“We know that high inflation takes a toll on families,” Powell said in brief remarks at the White House event where Biden announced the nominations.
Brainard also pledged to support a growing economy “that includes everyone,” and a Fed that “serves all Americans in every community.”
U.S. stocks hit record highs after the news. Treasury bond yields also rose and the dollar strengthened.
Powell's reappointment had been encouraged by a cross-section of investors and economists with both conservative and liberal leanings, and was welcomed by Congress members of both parties. 
The Fed's aggressive actions at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 were hailed as staving off a potential Depression. Later, some lauded his focus on jobs in the new policy framework launched just over a year ago, and others argued it would be too risky to oust the Fed chair during a sensitive transition from the emergency measures taken during the health crisis.
CHANCE TO CEMENT A LEGACY
Powell's second term would begin in early February, and the coming months will be crucial in determining whether his legacy will be as the Fed chair who elevated employment to the center of Fed policy, or as the one who let inflation surge and reestablish itself as a chronic problem.
Powell, who joined the Fed as a governor in 2012, did not anticipate being named chair when Trump was elected. With a pre-Fed career that had included eight years as a partner at The Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, and no formal economics training, he had instead eyed the vice chair for supervision position eventually filled by Randal Quarles.
He was confirmed as Fed chair on an 84-13 vote, with Kamala Harris, now Biden's vice president, among those opposing him.
He soon ran afoul of Trump, who hurled unprecedented public broadsides against Powell over Twitter and in frequent media appearances. At one point Trump labeled Powell an ""enemy"" of the United States for raising interest rates and explored whether he could fire him.
Powell not only survived but arguably grew in the job.
Initially hawkish as a governor, upon assuming the helm for U.S. monetary policy he considered himself a student at first, paying particular attention to arguments over whether the Fed's focus on inflation had disadvantaged workers. The years since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis had convinced many that was the case.
In November 2018, Powell launched a policy review that culminated in August 2020 with the adoption of an approach allowing economic expansions to run longer and ""hotter,"" with temporarily higher rates of inflation. Ideally that would lead to job gains that reach broadly into society and narrow the gaps in unemployment among different demographic groups.
It was an approach that conformed to what seemed then to be the changing nature of the U.S. economy, with embedded low inflation and low interest rates, and adapted as well to the demands of a pandemic crisis that threatened a permanent hole in the U.S. job market.
Just over a year into that new approach, however, inflation is running at levels not seen in decades as resurgent demand for goods and services outstrips the supply of materials and labor in an economy still shaking off the rust of pandemic shutdowns.

659,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve during Jerome Powell's second term as chair will have an important role to play over the longer term to ensure that inflation does not become ""endemic,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Monday.
Yellen said she believed Powell's nomination and that of Lael Brainard as vice chair would win broad support in Congress and that she was confident in their ability ""to make good judgments"" on balancing the Fed's dual mandates of maintaining maximum employment and price stability.
""I think we do have to be concerned about inflation. It's reached the levels that concern most Americans who are seeing it and their pocketbook when they go to the store to buy food or to fill up their cars,"" said Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014 to 2018.
She adding she believes that it is due to a supply-demand imbalance and economic bottlenecks that need to be worked out and expressed confidence the surge in prices would subside.
""Over the longer run, the Fed needs to play an important role to make sure that this doesn't become endemic. And I know that he can be counted on to do that,"" she said of Powell.
The U.S. economy is now experiencing a ""strong growth spurt"" that will continue into next year and it is up to the Fed to determine how much monetary support is needed, given falling unemployment, built-up household savings and other factors, Yellen said.
""What we do see in the marketplace, with a strong dollar and generally low, longer-term interest rates, is confidence that inflation is not something that is going to become long lasting or endemic in the U.S. economy and that's important.""
She said the Fed was gearing up to include analysis of climate change as part of its stress testing because it ""poses a major risk to financial institutions.""",0

663,"SAN SALVADOR, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Prosecutors in El Salvador on Monday raided the premises of seven non-governmental organizations to probe alleged irregularities in the allocation and management of public funds, the attorney general's office said.
Eight locations across El Salvador were raided after a complaint by lawmakers in President Nayib Bukele's ruling party who are investigating the groups on suspicion of having received public funds through the influence of past lawmakers.
Prosecutors say $4.9 million in public funds are under review. They have flagged crimes such as suspected embezzlement in their investigation of the groups, which are dedicated to issues like education, human rights and development.
Most were created after the 1992 peace accords at the end of the country's civil war, and made up of former fighters in the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), which as a political party ruled El Salvador from 2009 to 2019.
One of the groups, a feminist organization called Las Melidas, told local media the raids were politically motivated.
""We think this is a rigged procedure, specifically aimed at criminalizing us,"" said Azucena Ortiz, director of Las Melidas.",0
664,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) said on Monday it had terminated some employees of its global commercial services division for inappropriately pitching some products, with respect to tax benefits.
The company said the issue primarily involved Premium Wire, which enables businesses to send wire payments globally, and that it had hired a law firm to investigate its small business sales practices in the United States, including sales of Premium Wire.
The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that some of the company's salespeople had pitched a strategy to business owners, relying on a shaky interpretation of how tax law treats rewards points.
""This misconduct should not have happened,"" the company said in a statement. ""As a result of an internal investigation, we terminated employees and disciplined others, made product changes, adjusted our sales compensation plan, required additional training, and reinforced our permitted sales practices and policies.""
AmEx said it was discontinuing the Premium Wire Service and was eliminating the Membership Rewards component for a working capital solution, which was created for one supplier and its buyers.
The services under investigation accounted for less than a quarter of 1% of AmEx's global revenue from 2018 through September 2021, it said.",0
665,"CARACAS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition needs to rebuild and reflect on its strategy after suffering a heavy defeat in regional elections at the weekend, its leader Juan Guaido said on Monday, calling for unity among the fragmented movement's leadership.
Venezuela's ruling party won at least 18 governorships out of 23 states, according to updated election results published by the National Electoral Council (CNE) on Monday.
The electoral authority had earlier declared the ruling party victorious in 20 governorship elections. But close elections in Barinas and Apure states, which traditionally back the Socialist party, led the CNE to later say those results remained to be confirmed.
Opposition politicians have so far won just three states.
The main opposition parties had boycotted presidential elections in 2018 and congressional polls in 2020, arguing a fair ballot was impossible because of interference from President Nicolas Maduro's government and violent gangs loyal to him.
But they returned to the ballot box this year amid frustration over the failure of U.S. sanctions to dislodge Maduro despite prolonged social and economic hardship.
Sunday's vote was seen as a test of strength ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2024. The opposition was also emboldened by the presence of election observers from the European Union.
A preliminary report from the mission is due on Tuesday, but there were no major reports of disruptions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Maduro's government of holding flawed elections that ""skewed the process"" to pre-determine the result in his party's favor, citing harassment and bans of opposition candidates, voter roll manipulation, and censorship.
Guaido, the former speaker of Congress who is recognized by Washington and its allies as Venezuela's rightful leader, said on Monday that the opposition needed to ""rebuild itself"" after the disappointing result.
""Today a new phase is opening,"" he said, without providing specifics. ""Today is a time for reflection amongst our leadership... It is not the time for fights nor egotism among political leaders.""
Analysts said ahead of the vote that the opposition's late decision to participate and in-fighting over whether it should run candidates would damage its showing.
The opposition urgently needed to rethink its strategy in order to reconnect with voters and burnish its credibility, said Enderson Sequera, head of Venezuela's Politiks consultancy.
""The conclusion of (Sunday's vote) in Venezuela is very clear: Chavismo is more stable in power and the democratic opposition finds itself further from achieving political change,"" Sequera said, referring to the nickname for the ruling party, once headed by the late President Hugo Chavez.
NEED TO REBUILD TRUST
Despite opposition efforts to galvanize voters at the last minute, turnout was relatively low at 41.8%, according to the CNE. That is equivalent to some 8.1 million people and is in line with previous local and regional elections. Low turnout in Venezuela favors the ruling Socialist party's political machine, analysts say.
""The government has shown again that despite not having widespread popular support, it remains in power due to the lack of an opposition with a coordinated strategy,"" said Maryhen Jimenez, a researcher at the University of Oxford's Latin American Centre.
After seeing living standards decline amid hyperinflation and a seven-year recession, many ordinary Venezuelans are disillusioned with politics. Millions of people have emigrated.
The ruling party saw supporter numbers drop to 3.7 million, according to CNE figures, from some 5.9 million votes in 2017 regional elections.
The oil-rich state of Zulia was won by opposition politician Manuel Rosales with 56.1% of the vote, who said it was clear that Venezuela's opposition movement faced challenges.
""You can't hide this crisis with complacent speeches,"" Rosales, a lawyer and former presidential candidate, said on Monday in Maracaibo, Zulia's capital.
The CNE has yet to announce victors in mayorship races - with the exception of capital Caracas, where the ruling party candidate won.
Maduro said on Sunday a return to negotiations in Mexico with the Venezuelan opposition would not take place until ""the kidnap"" of prominent government envoy Alex Saab - recently extradited to the United States on money laundering charges - is answered for.
The talks, begun in August, are meant to seek a way out of Venezuela's economic and social crisis.
Guaido said he was cautiously optimistic the government would return to the table and he was discussing with international allies ways of increasing pressure on Maduro's government.",0

Case numbers in Germany have been soaring, especially among the elderly whose first two shots of COVID-19 vaccine were at the start of the year, and among children who are not eligible for inoculation.
Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said European countries must work harder to prevent the coronavirus spreading further as deaths and new cases surge.
Current transmission rates in 53 European countries are of ""grave concern"" and new cases are nearing record levels, exacerbated by the more transmissible Delta variant of the virus, the WHO's Hans Kluge warned. ""We must change our tactics, from reacting to surges of COVID-19, to preventing them from happening in the first place,"" he said.
Germany has already decided to limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are filling with COVID-19 patients.

667,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - San Diego Wave FC have acquired the rights to sign United States World Cup-winning defender Abby Dahlkemper, the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) expansion team announced on Monday.

668,"November 22, 2021 - As McKinsey aptly stated in 2016 we are in ""the age of analytics: competing in a data driven world."" There is no better evidence of this than in our daily consumer experiences.
Amazon recommends what sneakers you should buy based on your purchasing history. The app from your favorite grocery store auto-creates a digital grocery list for your online order. Lyft, Blue Apron and Airbnb ask you to rate your experience after each purchase to improve the customer experience.
Legal is not immune from this data-driven trend, as evidenced by the crowded market of legal tech providers striving to create the perfect combination of data and tech to provide the ""Amazon"" experience. As we sharpen our focus on the impact of data in legal, what we have come to know in our personal lives will soon enough be the new normal in the legal profession. Here are the trends powering that change.
Legal technologies are full of valuable data. The legal tech market, which is expected to reach $2.49 billion in revenue by 2025 , is a rich source of data for the legal function.
There are entire categories of legal tech designed to mine public and company data for the legal department, including litigation analytics (Westlaw Edge, Lex Machina), market intelligence (What's Market, Pitchbook) and operational and negotiation data on contracts (Ironclad, Icertis, Eigen, Blackboiler, Draftwise).
The availability of APIs (application programming interfaces) is also increasing. They provide legal departments with access to the ""mountains of legal data being generated every day"" , Through APIs, robust, external data sources and applications can be combined with legal department data to, among other things, spot how trends in the market are impacting the frequency of litigation, contractual preferences of customers and market deal terms.
Legal departments are taking control of their data. It is no secret that the legal function is sitting on a ""vast, untapped gold mine of data"" .
Historically, much of the matter and deal data needed to derive insights was not in the possession of the law department, but instead dispersed across law firms, unstructured and inaccessible. Today there are tools — like HighQ, Brightflag Workspace, M365, Evisort, Onit, Legal Tracker, SimpleLegal and more — that provide mechanisms for legal departments to access matter and deal data, along with precedent and historical advice, from their counsel.
With tools like Priori Scout and Marketplace, legal departments are also tapping into internal and external data sources to capture more robust data about their outside counsel — including specific experience and diversity metrics — and deepen their relationships.
This trend of technology shifting data to the control of legal departments is key. As companies prioritize data strategy and the creation of data lakes -- central repositories for storing structured and unstructured data at scale – they must first have control of their data. And the better the internal data, the more powerful it is when combined with market data.
Data is alive in images, not numbers. With more robust data now available, market leaders are focused on bringing data to life for their teams and their customers. Whether in the boardroom or the courtroom, tools like PowerBI and Tableau are being used to visualize legal advice and business intelligence.
What was once shared in written reports can now be conveyed through interactive dashboards, maps and more. For instance, dashboards and interactive platforms allow legal departments to guide employees through trade secret requirements and provide graphical representations of trends across offices, business units and competitors. Meanwhile, business leaders access regulatory heatmaps maintained by the legal department that allow the business to see the real-time regulatory climate in target jurisdictions.
Service providers are also enhancing the visual components of their offerings through development and technology. In 2019, Salesforce acquired Tableau to further its mission to ""help more people than ever see and understand data"". Most recently, Westlaw enhanced Practical Law with Dynamic Tool Set, which layers visualization onto existing content to help users navigate and discover information in new ways.
As data grows, so do data-focused roles. As the volume of legal data grows, so too does the role of data professionals within the legal ecosystem.
In 2020, the number of organizations with a dedicated legal operations function jumped from 57 to 81 percent. Data analytics, including capturing and mining data to support the business and strategy, is one of the key responsibilities of most legal operations departments, following only project management in CLOC's State of the Industry Survey.
Legal departments are also investing an estimated 30 percent more in data scientists and new roles are growing. McKinsey estimates that demand for ""data translators""— who bridge the gap between traditional data scientists and business stakeholders — is expected to reach 2 to 4 million in the United States by 2026. These roles will bring the discipline and skills needed to improve data collection, analysis and decision-making within legal and the business.
The deliverable has changed forever. Just as handwritten drafts on yellow notepads are a relic of the past, so too is legal advice devoid of market insights and packaged in long memoranda.
Today the market values insights drawn from legal and market data, delivered with visual images, and derived from work by lawyers and data specialists. As this approach continues to gain momentum, we will see legal departments capturing even more data, additional tools hitting the market and more opportunities for data-driven change in the profession.",0
669,"FRANKFURT, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Swedish activist fund Cevian has nearly halved its stake in Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE), it said on Tuesday, paring back its holding at a loss after a far-reaching overhaul it had long demanded arrived too late.
Cevian said it had reduced its shareholding in the German conglomerate to 7.9% from about 15% previously, not disclosing the price at which it sold the roughly 43 million shares in the steel-to-submarines group.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp fell 6% on the news.
""Cevian remains one of Thyssenkrupp's largest investors and will continue to support the company and management in becoming more successful and in creating more value for all stakeholders,"" the investor said in response to questions.
Thyssenkrupp's largest shareholder, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, said it would stay invested as an anchor shareholder.
Cevian's offering, run by UBS, launched with price guidance of 10.20-11.29 euros per share, resulting in proceeds of 439 million to 485 million euros ($493 million-$545 million), Refinitiv news service IFR said.
Cevian disclosed investments in Thyssenkrupp in 2013 and 2014. While it did not disclose at what price, shares in the German conglomerate traded at about 17-19 euros at the time, indicating the fund is taking a loss in its latest placement.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
The divestment highlights Cevian's sobering track record in Germany, which also includes a 26.67% stake in Bilfinger (GBFG.DE), shares of which have fallen in value since the fund first disclosed a stake in 2011.
Other holdings, including those in Switzerland's ABB (ABBN.S), which makes industrial robots and drives, and Swedish telecoms company Ericsson (ERICb.ST), have proven to be more successful.
The sale of Thyssenkrupp shares comes after a 30% share price rally this year and reflects the company's operational improvements after years of losses, including plans to list its hydrogen division in a share sale next year.  read more 
""The most recent results presented by Thyssenkrupp and the share price rise show that the turnaround is bearing fruit,"" Cevian said.",0
670,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to reappoint Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell arrives at a critical juncture for the central bank.
If confirmed by the Senate, Powell will stay at the helm of the Fed as it charts forward a path for monetary policy that manages to both control the highest inflation in decades without halting the labor market recovery before millions of unemployed Americans can benefit.
Progressive Democrats want the Fed to take on a more expansive role in the economy, by beefing up efforts to bolster employment, heading off climate risk and addressing inequality. Conservatives want it to stick to its monetary policy lane, pay more attention to tamping down inflation and reduce its footprint in financial markets and on the oversight front.
Powell will also need to tackle questions about the nature of money. Here are some of the biggest challenges he could face in the next four years:
GETTING POLICY RIGHT
After the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Fed slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and bought trillions of dollars of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
Fed policymakers started winding down the asset purchases this month. But some officials are now publicly debating whether it may be appropriate to speed up the pace of that taper, a topic that could come up when officials meet next month on Dec. 14 and 15.  read more 
Under a new framework adopted in August of 2020, Fed officials said they plan to wait to raise interest rates until the economy reaches full employment, and inflation is at 2% and on track to moderately exceed that level.
But Powell may have trouble with that promise depending on what happens with inflation. While many Fed policymakers believe the current burst of above-2% inflation is temporary, some say the Fed may need to raise rates sooner than expected next year to stifle the price increases. That could lead the central bank to slow the economy before all would-be workers can get a job.
As of October, there were still about 4 million fewer Americans employed than there were before the pandemic.
""We know that high inflation takes a toll on families, especially those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation,"" Powell said during a press conference on Monday after Biden announced the nomination. ""We use our tools both to support the economy and strong labor market, and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.""
FED AS WATCHDOG
If the Fed's new framework has it keeping monetary policy looser for longer in pursuit of a stronger labor market, analysts say, it may need to tighten financial regulations to avert risky behavior that could precipitate a crisis.
""Financial regulation in my view is number two on the agenda, and especially continuing to deal with the issue of containing financial risk in an environment of historically low interest rates,"" said David Wilcox, a former top economist at the Fed and currently a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Fed leaders will also need to look at financial stability more broadly, Wilcox said.
Systemic weaknesses in how Treasuries and money markets are traded were laid bare in March of 2020 by the near collapse of financial markets in the wake of the pandemic-related shutdowns.
Increasingly popular ""stablecoins,"" a largely unregulated form of cryptocurrency that can be pegged to the dollar, are an asset class that some Fed officials, including Powell, say require more regulation.
GOING DIGITAL?
One main question Powell could face is whether the Fed should issue its own digital currency. Powell has been non-committal so far. Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who Biden nominated to be promoted to vice chair, has said she would find it hard to imagine not doing so. The Fed plans to publish a discussion paper on the topic soon.
Supporters say a well-designed digital currency could lower transaction costs and increase access to the banking system for disadvantaged groups. Others worry that banks could be sidelined if American households and businesses dispense with regular checking accounts and go straight to the Fed.
China and other countries are already issuing their own digital currencies, as are private companies such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). If widely adopted, such tokens could fragment the payments system, threaten the Fed's ability to control interest rates, and endanger the U.S. dollar's global dominance.
CLIMATE RISKS
Powell will also be under pressure from progressives to understand and address the economic and financial market implications of uncontrolled wildfires, super-powerful hurricanes, and other devastating impacts of climate change.
Two progressive Democratic senators, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, issued a joint statement last week saying they oppose Powell's reappointment because they think he has not done enough to combat climate change.  read more 
But the Fed's mandate does not include any remit to combat climate change directly, as is the case for some other central banks.
The Fed created two internal panels last year, one focused on climate-related risks at individual banks, and the other on system-wide threats. It also became the last major central bank to join the Network for Greening the Financial System, which develops recommendations for central banks to respond to climate change.
Both could be vehicles for Powell to do more on the climate front, though a more aggressive stance on par with other central banks may prove difficult without new legislation.
RACIAL AND GENDER GAPS
Fed officials have also become more outspoken on the potential for racial and gender inequities to drag on economic growth.
U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, calls that ""mission creep."" Many on the left of the political divide, however, say it doesn't go far enough and fault the Fed's bond-buying program for lining rich people's pockets by boosting stock prices.
In his second term, Powell could help to fine-tune the Fed's tools for potentially narrowing some of those gaps, including through programs meant to boost lending to small businesses and supervisory changes that encourage banks to work with consumers struggling to repay their loans, said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist who is now president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.",0
671,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden launched an aggressive attack on gasoline prices last week, enlisting China and other nations in a possible joint release of oil reserves, and sharpening a probe into oil giants' pricing. 
The efforts may have limited impact on prices at the pump, experts say, but doing nothing would be a political mistake as gasoline prices hit a seven-year high.
The average U.S. retail gasoline price is $3.41 a gallon, up from $2.11 a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association.
Americans are by far the world's heaviest consumers of gasoline, thanks to big cars, long driving distances and little public transportation in many areas.
""Americans expect the president to do something about this,"" said Larry Sabato, political scientist at the University of Virginia. ""We need to have a national conversation about the law of supply and demand.""
""Inflation is so cutting, and can really destroy a presidency,"" Sabato added, citing Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, who both tried unsuccessfully to encourage Americans to curb gasoline consumption as prices jumped.
American purchases of bigger sport utility vehicles and trucks, which have lower fuel efficiency, have jumped in recent years, suggesting gasoline prices will be a political issue for years to come.
HIGH U.S. GASOLINE CONSUMPTION NOT SLOWING DOWN
U.S. consumers use more gasoline per person than any other country in the world at nearly 1.2 gallons (5.5 litres) per day, according to calculations by Global Petrol Prices, 10 times the rate of China and many European countries. Those figures do not include diesel fuel. Including diesel would increase European fuel consumption by about 20%, the research group's economist, Neven Valev, estimates.
Biden's approval ratings recently slipped to the lowest they have been all year, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with just 44% of Americans approving of his job performance. His Democrats face midterm elections in November 2022 when they will try to maintain their slim congressional majorities.
Americans' top issue of concern is the economy, the poll shows, as it has been for 11 weeks.
Stock markets are at record highs, manufacturing is surging and employment has returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels. But consumer costs rose the most in 31 years in October, thanks in big part to high gasoline prices.
Crude oil accounts for more than half the cost of a retail gallon of gasoline, with taxes an additional 15% or so. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries still has 3.8 million barrels per day in supply cuts from last year that it has not returned to the market.
Since the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974, U.S. presidents have struggled at some point with rising gasoline prices, often with little control over the crises abroad that usually are the underlying cause.
Richard Nixon was president during the world’s first oil shock - a dramatic increase in pump prices in 1973 when OPEC nations decided to punish the United States and other countries for supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War.
""It had a devastating effect on Nixon’s overall standing, which was already weakened by Watergate,” said presidential historian Thomas Alan Schwartz. ""He tried to rally the country around energy independence. That didn’t work.""
When Ford took over as president on the resignation of Nixon, the Republican faced inflation of 12.3%.
His “Whip Inflation Now,” campaign featuring WIN buttons, T-shirts and coffee cups, urged Americans to fight high fuel prices by carpooling and turning down thermostats. It was viewed as a political disaster, and he lost to Carter, a Democrat, in the 1976 election.
Carter also tried to encourage Americans to wean themselves from OPEC through conservation. But after a second major oil shock in 1979, when the Iranian revolution took place and production plummeted, he faced rising prices and long lines at gasoline stations. He lost his bid for re-election to Republican Ronald Reagan.
Oil prices jumped to $140 per barrel and pump prices to $4 a gallon during Republican George W. Bush's second term. With the onset of the Great Recession in late 2007, his approval rating sank to 25%.
PRESSURE ON BIG COMPANIES
The White House has also redoubled pressure on big gasoline refiners, slowing down mergers in the oil and gas industry and asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate possible anti-competitive behavior - something others have tried.
""There is a long history that says that these are frequently used political gestures,"" said former FTC Chairman William  Kovacic. ""The consequence of these inquiries is futile.""
Bush and his Democratic successor, Barack Obama, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate gasoline price rises that occurred after Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005 and the economic recovery following the 2007-2009 recession.
In Biden's case, ""there may be something to his claims,"" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset, an investment firm, wrote last week. ""Gasoline prices are 34 cents higher than what can explained by crude oil prices.""",0
672,"AMMAN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Jordan's parliament began deliberations on Monday of proposed constitutional reforms that officials say revitalise the monarchy and are part of a drive to deliver on long promised political reforms.
A royal committee appointed by King Abdullah drafted the proposals to try to modernize the country's political system and revamp the existing political parties and elections law.
In April former crown prince Hamza was accused of agitating against Abdullah, exposing faultlines within a royal family that has helped shield Jordan from the sort of turmoil that has consumed neighbouring Syria and Iraq.
Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawneh said the draft legislation would pave the way for a prime minister emerging from a parliamentary majority rather than one handpicked by the monarch, a main plank of the reformist agenda favored by a mix of Islamist and tribal figures.
""..It allows the leader of the country (king) to go towards party based governments,"" he told the assembly.
U.S.-backed Abdullah, who can dissolve parliament and appoint governments and is the ultimate arbiter in the country of 10 million, has said in recent years he hoped one day to become a constitutional monarch.
The proposals include setting up a national security council headed by the monarch falling under government jurisdiction, a move some experts and politicians see as whittling away the monarch's powers.
Liberal politicians say the monarch, who has ruled since 1999, has been forced to opt for timid steps toward democracy in response to regional turmoil, constrained by a conservative bureaucracy and a tribal power base which sees reforms as a threat to political and economic benefits.
""This is a coup against the Jordanian constitution and its institutions ... How dare the government attack the constitution in this manner,"" said deputy Saleh al Armouti in a heated session.
Some deputies also criticized the alterations to the kingdom’s constitution saying it also sidelined parliament and eroded successive governments’ executive powers.
Other changes in the text seen by Reuters widen the representation of women and political parties in an expanded 138-member assembly. It lowers the age for elected deputies to 25 years.
Jordan has in recent years seen bouts of civil unrest and street protests led by disaffected tribes and a mainly Islamist opposition that has demanded the king fight corruption and called for wider political freedoms.",0

676,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday told Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan that an agreement to reinstate Hamdok was only a ""first step"" in restoring Sudan's democratic transition, according to a spokesperson.
Hamdok was restored to his post on Sunday. He had been detained following the Oct. 25 military takeover. First appointed after the overthrow of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a 2019 uprising, Hamdok will lead a civilian government of technocrats for a transitional period.
U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Blinken called on the two Sudanese leaders to build on the ""first step"" of the agreement and continue the transition that was interrupted by the coup.
Blinken's message was that, ""We must continue to see progress, we must continue to see Sudan move back down the democratic path, and that starts with the reinstitution of the Prime Minister but it certainly doesn't end there,"" Price told reporters.
Price called on Sudan's leaders to release all civilian leaders and others and lift a state of emergency.
Sudan's military promised to release all political detainees after weeks of deadly disturbances triggered by the coup, although large crowds took to the streets to reject any deal involving the army.",0
677,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Experimental chewing gum reduces virus in saliva
An experimental chewing gum containing a protein that ""traps"" coronavirus particles could limit the amount of virus in saliva and help curb transmission when infected people are talking, breathing or coughing, researchers believe. The gum contains copies of the ACE2 protein found on cell surfaces, which the virus uses as a gateway to break into cells and infect them. In test-tube experiments using saliva and swab samples from infected individuals, virus particles attached themselves to the ACE2 ""receptors"" in the chewing gum. As a result, the viral load in the samples fell by more than 95%, the research team from the University of Pennsylvania reported in Molecular Therapy. The gum feels and tastes like conventional chewing gum, can be stored for years at normal temperatures, and chewing it does not damage the ACE2 protein molecules, the researchers said. Using gum to reduce viral loads in saliva , they suggest, would add to the benefit of vaccines and would be particularly useful in countries where vaccines are not yet available or affordable.
Protection may last longer after vaccine booster dose
Protection against COVID-19 from an mRNA vaccine - either the Moderna (MRNA.O) or Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech  shots - may last longer after the booster dose than after the original two-shot regimen, researchers speculated based on the results of a small new study. They measured vaccine responses before and after the boosters in 33 healthy middle-aged adults who had received their second doses an average of nine months earlier. Before the boosters, their antibody levels had decreased about 10-fold from levels early after their second dose. By 6 to 10 days after the booster, their antibody levels had climbed 25-fold and were five times higher than after two doses of the vaccine, according to a report posted on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. In the volunteers who had COVID-19 before being vaccinated, antibody levels after the booster were 50-fold higher than after their infections. ""Because these antibody levels are so robust, the booster could potentially give us protection for a longer duration than what we saw for two doses of the vaccine,"" study coauthor Alexis Demonbreun of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said in a statement.
Blood test detects virus exposure without antibodies
Because not everyone produces measurable amounts of COVID-19 antibodies after infection or vaccination, UK researchers have developed a single blood test that not only detects antibodies but also measures other signs of an immune system response to the virus. Specifically, it measures T cells, powerful immune cells that learn to recognize the virus either after encountering it during infection or through vaccination. As part of the new test, blood samples are exposed to replicas of small pieces of the virus. If the T cells in the blood sample recognize these pieces, they are triggered to produce molecules that can be easily measured, such as the inflammatory protein interferon-gamma. ""The test is very sensitive and seems to be accurate,"" said Martin Scurr of Cardiff University School of Medicine, coauthor of a report published in Immunology. This was true even in patients with cancer, many of whom do not produce antibodies in response to vaccination. ""The test is easy to employ and should play a very useful role"" in monitoring antibody and T cell responses to the virus, Scurr said. ""However, it remains to be determined what level of antibody and T cell response against the virus might protect from future infection and COVID-19.""

678,"WASHINGTON/MONTREAL, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Air Canada (AC.TO) has agreed to a $4.5 million settlement to resolve a U.S. government investigation into claims thousands of air passenger refunds were delayed, the Transportation Department said.
The proposed settlement, which still must be approved by an administrative law judge, would resolve the U.S. Transportation Department investigation into what it said were ""extreme delays in providing refunds to thousands of consumers for flights to or from the United States that the carrier canceled or significantly changed"".
Of the $4.5 million settlement, $2.5 million would be credited to Air Canada for refunding passengers and $2 million would be paid to the U.S. Treasury.
Air Canada said it agreed to settle without any finding of wrongdoing ""to avoid protracted litigation as Air Canada focuses, together with all stakeholders, on rebuilding following the pandemic.""
Air Canada said it has provided C$730.4 million ($575 million) in refunds on flights to or from the United States significantly changed since March 2020 as well as more than C$10 million in goodwill payments to passengers not entitled to refunds under U.S. law.
In June, the department said it was seeking a $25.5 million fine from Air Canada over the carrier's failure to provide timely refunds, alleging Air Canada continued its no-refund policy in violation of U.S. law for more than a year.
The U.S. Transportation Department said it plans to soon propose formal rules to codify its interpretation of requirements that airlines provide prompt refunds when carriers cancel or make a significant change, including when the ticket purchased is non-refundable. The rules will also ""address additional protections for consumers who are unable to travel due to government restrictions.""
Air Canada said in June it has been refunding non-refundable tickets as part of the Canadian government's financial package.
The Transportation Department in June disclosed it was also ""actively investigating the refund practices of other U.S. and foreign carriers flying to and from the United States"", saying it would take ""enforcement action"" as appropriate. It reiterated those comments Monday.

679,"SANTIAGO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - After years of divisive street protests and the election of a mainly left-wing body to rewrite the constitution, Chileans surprised analysts, markets and even themselves on Sunday night by favoring a right-wing presidential candidate and delivering significant gains to conservatives in Congress.
With 99.99% of votes counted as of Monday, ultra-conservative former congressman Jose Antonio Kast had won 27.91%, and leftist lawmaker Gabriel Boric had come in second, with 25.83%. As both fell well short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright, they will now advance to a Dec. 19 runoff.
Kast, who has pledged to crack down on crime and illegal immigration, appears to have the momentum, though Boric can still eke out a victory if he wins over enough centrists, analysts said.
Still, the results of congressional elections may make the radical changes to Chile's free-market model that Boric has promised out of reach. Leftist and center-left coalitions lost significant ground in both the upper and lower houses, and no coalition is expected to emerge with a functioning majority.
""It's going to be very difficult for any of the two major coalitions in the Senate to pass legislation,"" said Kenneth Bunker, head of political consultancy Tresquintos.
""For the conservative sectors, this is not a problem as they are in favor of the status quo, but for the opposition it is very bad news.""
Just six months ago, Chileans had favored left-wing independents when selecting representatives to the body charged with rewriting the nation's dictatorship-era constitution. Boric, a 35-year-old who rose to fame leading student protests, has thrown his support behind the constitutional rewrite.
But crime fears, ongoing confrontations between police and separatist indigenous groups in the nation's south and fatigue with continued protests and disorder in what is traditionally one of Latin America's most stable countries likely played a role in the swing to the right, analysts said.
""What's happening in the south, combined with crime and the general idea of change without really knowing what changes will be made caused a significant portion of the population to turn against Boric,"" said Miguel Angel Lopez, a professor at the University of Chile.
While some recent opinion polls had shown Kast gaining ground, many Chileans and political observers did not expect him to do as well as he did, given the country's leftward turn in recent years.
""It seems sad to me, sad after everything that has happened to the country,"" Salvador Carrasco, a musician in central Santiago, said on Monday morning.
Chile's benchmark IPSA equities index (.SPIPSA) was up over 10%, while the country's peso currency gained ground against the dollar overnight.
The rally in the peso was due to relief that Congress was split, which will act as a moderating force if Boric wins, said Mary-Therese Barton, Head of Emerging Debt at Pictet Asset Management.
""Markets' first reaction has certainly been positive. It's less to do with the presidential side and more to do with Congress,"" she said.
In the presidential runoff, eyes will now be on how successful both candidates will be at winning voters outside their traditional bases of support. Five failed candidates between them garnered some 46% of votes that are now up for grabs.
Perhaps the biggest mystery will be how those who voted for libertarian economist Franco Parisi will cast their votes. Parisi, who lives in Alabama and never set foot in Chile during the campaign, surprised many by finishing third with 12.8% of the vote.
""The Parisi voter is neither on the Left nor the Right,"" said Guillermo Holzmann, a professor at the University of Valparaiso.
""This is a vote that will need a lot of analysis.""",0
680,"TORONTO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Canada is ending its pandemic-era policy of turning back asylum-seekers trying to cross into the country between ports of entry, according to a revised policy document released on Sunday.
Canada turned at least 544 would-be refugees back to the Unites States between March 2020 and mid-October. The government did not immediately respond to questions regarding why it was ending the policy now and what if any quarantine rules would apply to asylum-seekers who are not vaccinated.
Canada had said the measure was necessary given health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic. But refugee advocates argued attempts to claim asylum should not be considered ""discretionary travel"" and pointed to class exemptions Canada made during the pandemic for professional athletes, among others.
""It's a relief to see the measures for refugees align more with our international obligations, and I think it's been clear all along that public health and refugee protection could coexist,"" said Maureen Silcoff, a refugee lawyer and past president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, which took the government to court over the policy.
Silcoff said it did not make sense to allow tourists entry, as Canada has begun to do, while barring people seeking protection.
An unknown number of asylum-seekers turned back were taken into indefinite U.S. immigration detention and at least two were deported, refugee lawyers working on their cases say.
Exemptions have been available since the policy began, and in August Canada began allowing more turned-back asylum-seekers to return and file refugee claims as part of what it called a ""managed approach to reopening the border.""
But advocates said this option was only open to those aware of it or who had legal counsel familiar with Canada's shifting system. The government defended the policy in court last month.
Canada has a Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. under which asylum-seekers trying to cross at official ports of entry are turned back. The agreement, challenged twice, was upheld most recently this past spring and may go to Canada's Supreme Court.",0
681,"BERLIN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel talked on the phone with Belarusian opposition leader in exile Svetlana Tikhanouskaya about the political crisis in Belarus and the ""difficult situation"" at the border with the European Union, a government spokesperson said on Monday.
""The Chancellor underlined the continued support of the Federal Government for the Belarusian democracy movement and stressed that the political leadership of the country must end the repression against the opposition and independent journalists, release prisoners and enter into a serious dialogue with society in order to resolve the crisis through fair and free elections,"" spokesperson Steffen Seibert said.
Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko claimed a resounding victory in last year's presidential election despite the widely held view that the vote was fraudulent. Various opposition groups say Tikhanouskaya won.
The resulting crackdown has involved hundreds thrown in prison and there have been allegations that opposition activists were tortured. It also spurred a lively opposition movement in countries like Latvia, Lithuania and Germany where many Belarusians live.

682,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company New Fortress Energy Inc's  permit to ship liquefied natural gas (LNG) by rail could expire on Nov. 30, environmental groups opposed to those shipments said on Monday.
New Fortress wants to transport LNG from a liquefaction plant it is developing in Wyalusing in northeast Pennsylvania via truck or train to a port in Gibbstown, New Jersey.
The LNG would then be exported by ship from Gibbstown to customers in the Caribbean and elsewhere. The Gibbstown terminal is owned by Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC's (FTAI.N) Delaware River Partners LLC subsidiary.
New Fortress, however, has not yet made a final decision to build the Pennsylvania plant, which would liquefy natural gas from the Marcellus shale.
The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued the permit to New Energy's Energy Transport Solutions in December 2019.
Delaware Riverkeeper, an environmental group opposed to the LNG project, said in a release that New Energy must apply to renew the permit 60 days before expiration to prevent it from expiring.
Officials at New Fortress, PHMSA and Fortress Transportation were not immediately available for comment.
Delaware Riverkeeper said New Fortress continues to pursue the proposed Gibbstown LNG export terminal.
Even if LNG by rail does not work, New Fortress could still transport LNG to the port by truck, the environmental group said.
New Fortress said in federal filings that it spent about $159 million through the end of 2020 to develop the Pennsylvania facility.",0

INVESTORS MAY WANT TO TAKE A ""BEV"" OUT FOR A SPIN (1356 EST/1856 GMT)
In her latest weekly market commentary, Saira Malik, CIO, head of global equities at Nuveen, takes a look at battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
Malik admits that BEVs are ""by no means new to the automotive lexicon,"" although they remain a small percentage of cars on the road. However, she says BEVs are well on their way to becoming mainstream, as global economies from the U.S. to the EU to China are making commitments to sustainability across the auto industry.
In fact, she says nearly all major traditional car manufacturers ""have begun to pledge a transition from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to BEVs over the next two decades for significant portions of their fleets.""
According to Malik, BEVs offer several advantages, from better performance and internet connectivity to environmental benefits. As a result, volume buyers such as car rental and shipping/logistic companies are already transferring orders away from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to their BEV counterparts.
As Malik sees it, over the longer-term, the impact of these purchases will ripple across used-car markets, ultimately depressing the value of pre-owned ICEs.
Still, she cautions that the near-term outlook for BEV-related equities may be inhibited by extended valuations, as well as by rising rates. However, looking forward, Nuveen believes the prospects for BEV makers are ""bright,"" as the number of entrants to the market increases and the costs to consumers become more competitive with existing ICE price tags — ""something we expect to see over the next 3 to 5 years.""
Additionally, she says that investors may want to consider exposure to BEV component manufacturers given that ""BEVs require twice as many of their inputs as do their ICE counterparts.""

S&P 500 YEAR-END 2022 TARGET 5,100 - GOLDMAN (1307 EST/18507 GMT)
In Goldman Sachs' (GS) latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart note, David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist, is highlighting his S&P 500 (.SPX) year-end 2022 target of 5,100.
He says this represents a 9% price gain from Friday and a total return with dividends of 10%. He says their 3-month and 6-month interim targets are 4,850 (+3%) and 5,000 (+6%) and reflect a supportive equity investment backdrop GS anticipates during 1H.
With this, Kostin offers three recommendations:
(1) Supply chains are starting to normalize and cyclical equities including “reopening” stocks should outperform
(2) Labor market tightness will persist and investors should skip firms with high labor costs relative to EBIT
(3) Bond yields will rise so fast-growing stocks valued entirely on long-term growth expectations would be vulnerable to rising rates or disappointing sales compared with growth stocks that enjoy high margins.

EXISTING HOME SALES: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN (1120 EST/1620 GMT)
Investors began Thanksgiving week by thanking President Joe Biden for keeping Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's steady hand on the tiller of monetary policy, and also expressing gratitude for a bit of better-than-expected economic data in the form of existing home sales.
For the last few months, the housing market has been the has-been of the economic recovery, falling victim to its early stardom.
Mandated lock downs initially sparked a stampede to the suburbs, launching demand - along with home prices - to the moon, a phenomenon resulting in the prospect of home ownership drifting beyond the realm of affordability for many potential buyers.
But the sector has recently shown signs of returning to an even keel.
Sales of pre-owned U.S. homes rose by 0.8% last month to 6.34 million units at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
The number came in 140,000 units above consensus and marked a slight acceleration from September's 0.7% gain.
The uptick helped keep the inventory of homes on the market steady at 2.3 months supply - below the historical average but up from the record low of 1.8 months reached last December.
""Home sales remain resilient, despite low inventory and increasing affordability challenges,"" writes Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist at NAR.
Yun also points out that just as the sector benefited from the pandemic's initial onset, it could be experiencing a second wind due to the current inflation wave.
""Inflationary pressures, such as fast-rising rents and increasing consumer prices, may have some prospective buyers seeking the protection of a fixed, consistent mortgage payment,"" he says.
The easing credit environment has also lent some support, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""For mortgaged buyers, the rebound in sales has been supported by lower rates since their spring peak, and a clear easing in lending standards,"" Shepherdson notes.
The NAR print falls neatly inline with other recent housing data, particularly the 4% increase in building permits and a rebound in homebuilder sentiment, both released last week.
While economic data holds a rear view mirror to recent activity, the stock market provides a forward-looking indicator, reflecting where investors see the housing sector six months to a year down the road.
Housing stocks - namely the Philadelphia SE Housing index (.HGX) and the S&P 1500 Home Building index (.SPCOMHOME) - handily outperformed the broader market as the global health crisis took its toll.
But as illustrated by the graphic below, over the last 12 months the HGX and the SPCOMHOME indexes are now essentially neck-and-neck with the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX).
Wall Street has grown greener as the morning progresses, with all three major indexes notching healthy gains in a broad rally.
Small caps (.RUT), chips (.SOX) and transports (.DJT) are leading the charge, all signs of economic optimism.

BANK SHARES CHEER LOUDEST FOR POWELL SECOND TERM (1050 EST/1550 GMT)
Shares of the biggest U.S. bank stocks (.SPXBK) are outperforming the broader market on Monday after the White House said it would nominate current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term while for vice chair, it picked Lael Brainard, the Fed board member who was seen as the other main contender for the top job.  read more 
""There's some consensus on the Street that Brainard is pretty far left of Powell in terms of her political views and would be a lot tougher on the banks via regulation and via scrutiny around mergers and acquisition activity,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York which specializes in trading financial stocks.
""It's a little bit of an initial relief rally that Powell is a little bit more of a Wall Street friendly choice.""
While Biden has yet to fill three Fed seats, including vice chair for supervision, a key role for bank regulation, investors seemed confident that Powell would be able to set the tone for regulation.
Grant said it was somewhat unusual for a Fed chair to be re-nominated by a Democratic president after being originally signed up by a Republican president.
""He's found a way to kind of navigate both sides of the aisle pretty well. And I think there's a quorum that he's a strong leader during a tough time."" he said.
""He's been the leader of the Fed during a very tumultuous time with COVID. He navigated the (former President Donald) Trump situation fairly well, which was sloppy and nasty at times,"" said Grant. ""People just generally feel better about the direction of the economy under Powell.""
The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) is up 2.4% and on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 23. Among the biggest percentage gainers in the group are SVB Financial (SIVB.O), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and People United Financial (PBCT.O).

U.S. SHARE BUYBACKS HIT RECORD IN Q3 (0921 EST/1421 GMT)
S&P 500 (.SPX) companies have made record quarterly share repurchases in Q3 2021, amounting to $225 billion, topping the previous record of $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.
Given the annual record of $806 billion set in 2019, a December quarter buyback as well as the remaining unreported Q3 of $204 billion in repurchases would set a new annual record, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note on Saturday. The 12-month high is $823 billion, set in the 12-months ending in March, 2019.
""At this point, I've penciled in a new annual record, with a new 12-month record being in the works,"" Silverblatt said.
Buybacks have roared back this year after bottoming out at $89 billion in the second quarter of last year as the U.S. economy shutdown due to the pandemic.

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT)
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.
Meanwhile, the IXIC ended at an all-time high on Friday. That makes 46 record closes so far in 2021 vs 55 for all of last year.
However, one measure of the Composite's internal strength has once again broken down:
After hitting a high of 75.7% earlier this month, which was well shy of its 2021 peaks, the Nasdaq New High/New Low (NH/NL) index fell to 53.3% on Friday. That was its weakest reading, with the IXIC at a record close, since Aug. 30. Back then, five trading days later, the Composite topped and then slid as much as 8% into its October trough.
Of note, just since early 2020, there have been five sharp IXIC declines from record high-territory, averaging about 15%, all of which were preceded by multi-week/multi-month NH/NL index divergence.
Unless this measure can at least reclaim its descending 10-day moving average, the risk is that it continues to trend down to test the 2020 trough, which was at 1.2%.
Additionally of note, last week saw three Hindenburg Omens triggered on the Nasdaq, and two on the NYSE Composite (.NYA). 
These clusters can highlight an especially fractured market, vulnerable to instability.

684,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Monday both noted the corrosive impact high inflation is having on the U.S. economy and American families in what may be a signal that controlling the rapid pace of price increases is now the central bank's top priority.
In brief remarks following Powell's nomination by President Joe Biden to a second term as head of the Fed and Brainard's nomination as the Fed's vice chair, each emphasized their awareness of how damaging inflation has become.
""We know that high inflation takes a toll on families, especially those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing and transportation,"" Powell said in comments alongside Biden and Brainard. ""We will use our tools both to support the economy - a strong labor market - and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.""
Brainard added she too was committed to putting working Americans at the centre of her agenda. ""This means getting inflation down at a time when people are focused on their jobs and how far their paychecks will go,"" Brainard said.
Inflation is at a 31-year high and has so far stymied predictions by most Fed policymakers earlier in the year that it would see a rapid unwind as the economy reopened.
The central bank has a dual mandate set by Congress of maximum employment and price stability. The Fed targets a 2% flexible average for inflation. Under Powell, the Fed has set a new framework in which it prioritizes getting as many Americans back to work as possible, but this is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain in the face of persistently high consumer price increases.
Several Fed officials have brought forward their expectations of when the central bank will raise interest rates from their current level near zero. Investors currently expect liftoff to occur in the middle of next year.",0

687,"GAZA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A Hamas official said on Monday that Qatar will start sending Gaza up to $10 million worth of Egyptian fuel a month under a plan to fund civil service pay in the impoverished Palestinian enclave ruled by the Islamist group.
Qatar announced on Nov. 17 that it had signed agreements with Egypt to supply fuel and building materials to Gaza. Qatari authorities did not respond to a request for comment on Monday about the fuel being used to pay Gaza civil servants.
A source familiar with the talks said Qatar and Hamas had not yet finalised an agreement over the initiative, which would see Hamas sell the fuel to Gaza petrol stations and use the proceeds to pay civil servants, including doctors and teachers.
Qatar and Hamas are still in discussions over checks Doha requires to ensure the proceeds of the fuel sold reach the civil servants it is intended for, the source added.
The initiative would help bypass Israeli curbs on Qatari aid to the enclave put in place before a war between Israel and Hamas in May.
Israel used to permit the Gulf state to send millions of dollars into Gaza through Israeli border crossings to support Hamas' cash-strapped government. But Israeli authorities halted such Qatari aid in May, demanding more checks on how the money is used.
""According to the agreement, Qatar will pay the equivalent of its monthly aid to Gaza civil servants, which is between $7 and $10 million, in fuel,"" said Salama Marouf, director of Gaza's government media office.
The fuel ""will come through the (Egyptian) border crossing, and will then be sold in the market ... the proceeds will then go to the treasury of the Gaza finance ministry, which will later pay it out to employees.""
Marouf said the cash raised from selling the fuel would help pay around 40,000 civil servants in Gaza, home to 2 million Palestinians.
Spokespeople for Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Defence Minister Benny Gantz and the defence ministry declined to comment.

689,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden cited unprecedented pressure that former President Donald Trump directed at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as one reason to renominate him on Monday.
Bucking critics in his own Democratic party, Biden said the Republican appointee's independence made him the best choice to lead the U.S. central bank with Lael Brainard, who had also been under consideration for the top job, as vice chair.  read more 
Biden laid out his reasoning for his decision during remarks to reporters that included multiple references to the chairman by the first name ""Jay"" that he is also known by.
""We need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve. Jay has proven the independence that I value in .. the Fed chair,"" Biden said. ""In the last administration, he stood up to unprecedented political interference and, doing so, successfully maintained the integrity and credibility,"" of the Fed, Biden said.
Trump in tapping Powell for the post in 2017 became the first president since Democrat Jimmy Carter not to reappoint a Fed chief installed by his predecessor and then quickly soured on his choice.
Within months of Powell taking the helm in February 2018, Trump began regularly castigating him in public as Powell continued with a slate of interest rate increases begun under former chair Janet Yellen.
Trump believed Powell was not doing enough to boost the economy and, along with it, Trump's political prospects, and explored firing him. The episode was seen as one of the most significant threats to the central bank's independence in a generation.
Biden's commitment to the Fed's independence is likely to be tested in the coming months.
Expectations are building in financial markets that the Fed will be forced to address high inflation with as many as three interest rate increases over the course of next year. These hikes could slow the pace of the economy and the job market's recovery, results that could hurt Biden politically.
Biden noted that Powell was confirmed to the position of Fed chair by 84 votes in the 100-member U.S. Senate in 2018.
""I believe that having Fed leadership with broad bipartisan support is important, especially now,"" with such a ""politically divided"" nation, Biden said.
""I believe we need to do everything we can to take the bitter partisanship of today's politics out of something as important as the independence and credibility of the Federal Reserve,"" he said.",0
690,"OTTAWA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Canada's ruling Liberals questioned on Monday whether rival Conservatives - the largest opposition party - were being honest about the vaccination status of their lawmakers as parliament reconvened after the September election.
Parliamentary rules require that all legislators be inoculated against COVID-19, a policy supported by every party except the Conservatives. The full House of Commons met for the first time since the pandemic forced virtual meetings or in-person sessions with reduced numbers last year.
The House re-elected Liberal Anthony Rota for his second stint as speaker. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will outline his priorities for the new session in a speech on Tuesday.
Over the weekend, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said all his lawmakers had been vaccinated or had secured a medical exemption.
""Every member is in compliance"" with the House rules on vaccination ""as far as we know,"" Jake Enwright, a Conservative spokesman, said on Monday. One vaccinated member who recently contracted COVID-19 is in quarantine, he added.
Some Conservative lawmakers ""are away due to reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or the House of Commons vaccine mandate,"" another Conservative spokesperson, Josie Sabatino, said.
""The likelihood that you have a medical exemption from the vaccination is one to five in 100,000,"" said Mark Holland, the Liberal government leader in the House. ""The Conservative caucus is 119 people, (so) statistically the likelihood that they would have multiple people who are exempt ... is extraordinarily low.""
The Liberals have one member who was granted a medical exemption, but the House speaker's office declined to say how many total exemptions there had been among the 338 House members.
Trudeau narrowly won the September election, but with a minority government that depends on opposition parties to pass legislation.
He has been exploiting divisions in the Conservative Party over vaccines as O'Toole fends off calls by some for a leadership review given the election loss. Trudeau's government is putting some 13,000 civil servants on unpaid leave because of their refusal to get inoculated, a move supported by 70% of Canadians, according to a recent EKOS Research poll.
Opposition New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh also weighed in on Monday, accusing Conservatives of ""not wanting to keep their colleagues safe"" and showing ""their complete lack of understanding"" of what people are going through.",0

692,"AUSTIN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is planning to spend more than $1 billion on its new vehicle factory in Austin, Texas, and plans to complete construction by the end of this year, public filings with a Texas state agency showed.
Filings submitted to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) on Friday outlined Tesla's spending on various manufacturing capabilities at its Austin factory. The company  said it plans to complete construction of its general assembly, paint, casting, stamping and body shop facilities by Dec. 31.
The five facilities would have a combined square footage of nearly 4.3 million (0.4 square kilometer), and cost a combined $1.06 billion, according to the filings.
Electric vehicle news outlet electrek first reported on the filings on Monday.
The TDLR regulates and licenses a broad range of businesses, facilities and equipment. The Tesla filings were made under the agency's architectural barriers project, which reviews and inspects projects ensure they comply with Texas' accessibility regulations.
The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has previously said the company plans to start limited production of its Model Y mid-size SUV this year, and high-volume production next year.
Construction for Tesla's new factory, located close to the airport on the eastern outskirts of Austin and projected to cost $1.1 billion, began during the summer of 2020. The company is expected to receive nearly $65 million in local tax rebates for the factory, which Tesla said will create some 10,000 jobs, most of them low skilled.
Construction groups can be seen working on the massive plant day and night, and the factory building is expected to be at least 0.75 miles (1.21 km) long once completed.  read more

697,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Residents on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro on Monday found the corpses of at least eight people in a mangrove after a sustained gunbattle with local police.
The bodies were found near a complex of slums called Salgueiro, in the city of Sao Goncalo, a poor and violent region that is part of metropolitan Rio.
Locals told media outlets that they believed other bodies would be found.
""The bodies were all thrown into a mangrove swamp, with signs of torture. They were tossed one on top of the other. This was clearly a massacre,"" one resident told the G1 news website.
Other residents, who also declined to be named, gave similar accounts to other outlets.
The bodies were found after a weekend-long operation in the area, which began after a local police officer died while on patrol on Saturday. Sao Gonacalo is overseen by the 7th battalion, which has long been one of Rio state's most deadly.
Rio's military police did not respond to locals' accusations of officers having been involved in torture or multiple killings but said in a statement: ""So far, eight bodies have been found.""
Police said they had entered the region to ""stabilize"" it after violence from alleged drug gangs.
They said officers would remain in the area to allow civil police officers to investigate.
In 2019, Reuters reported on the shooting to death of a local resident by officers from the 7th amid a sharp rise in police killings. So far this year, officers from the 7th battalion killed 1,096 people, the highest of any battalion in the state, and up 17% from the first nine months of last year.",0
698,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies are expected to stick with their current plan of gradually increasing output monthly, unless disrupted by unforeseen external factors, said Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the Riyadh-based International Energy Forum (IEF).
OPEC+, as the wider group is called, has said it intends to stick to plans for a gradual increase in output of about 400,000 barrels per day each month. The IEF is the largest international organization of energy ministers, with 71 member countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States.
""I see them sticking to their current plan in light of the supply surplus for next year, which is typical for oil markets in the first quarter,"" McMonigle told Reuters Monday. ""If they are going to make a change, it will be because of unforeseen external factors, such as these lockdowns in Europe, any kind of strategic release, and shifts in jet fuel demand.""
The oil market rose on concerns the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies could withhold barrels in response to a release of strategic petroleum reserves.
The move was attributed in part to a Monday press release from the IEF that included comments McMonigle made in a conversation with Japanese officials, where he stated that unexpected events could cause OPEC+ to alter its course.
He said a swifter-than-expected return of long-haul international flights would be another factor that could alter the view of OPEC+.
""If that comes back quicker, and more robustly, as everything associated with COVID has, that is something they [OPEC+] will take into account,"" he said.
""To the extent there's anything unforeseen, they will respond, because they don't think it's in their interest for prices to climb sharply,"" he told Reuters. ""They want to see the global economy recover and it's important for their customers, at the end of the day.""",0
699,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. airlines and airports braced for a surge of travelers ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, hoping the weather forecast remains calm as millions more Americans will hit the roads or skies.
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said Friday was the single busiest air travel day since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, as it screened 2.24 million travelers.
TSA expects to screen about 20 million air passengers during the busy Thanksgiving travel period, compared with nearly 26 million in the same period in 2019.
""We are ready,"" TSA Administrator David Pekoske told reporters on Friday at Washington Reagan National Airport. ""We will be able to handle the passenger volumes that we anticipate seeing.""
As vaccination rates have risen, many Americans are traveling for the holidays after skipping family gatherings last November and December.
Travel group AAA forecasts 53.4 million people will travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, up 13% from 2020 with most travelers going by car. About 48.3 million Thanksgiving travelers are expected to go by car, up from 47.1 million last year, but still below 2019's 49.9 million.
Car travelers will be facing gasoline prices hovering near the highest point since 2014, which will prompt some Americans not to make holiday trips.
Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said some Americans ""are responding to the prices by slamming the car door shut and staying off the road.""
Airlines are ramping up staffing and offering bonuses and other incentives to employees facing the busy holiday travel season.
Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it expects to fly up to 5.6 million passengers from Friday through Nov. 30, nearly 300% over 2020's 2.2 million Delta passengers for the period but still below the 6.3 million passengers during the same period in 2019.
United Airlines said it anticipates more than 4.5 million passengers during the Thanksgiving travel period - about 88% of 2019 volume.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby told Skift last week he had a lot of confidence in the airline's ability to fly its holiday schedule. ""We've left ourselves a margin of error,"" Kirby said.
He warned problems can ripple and ""If you are not careful it can cascade into a meltdown.""
Some other airlines have in recent weeks seen weather issues result in hundreds of daily cancellations over several days.
United said it was adding about 700 domestic flights for Thanksgiving week, and would fly 87% of its 2019 domestic schedule in November.",0
700,"JERUSALEM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Israel began rolling out Pfizer/BioNtech COVID-19 vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds on Monday hoping to beat down a recent rise in coronavirus infections.
A fourth wave of infections that hit Israel in June began subsiding in September. But over the past two weeks the ""R"", or reproduction rate of the virus, that had remained below one for two months began climbing and has now crossed that threshold, indicating the virus could again be spreading exponentially.
Daily cases have also crept up over the past few days, with half the confirmed infections presently among children age 11 and younger.
The children's vaccine drive kicked off on Monday in a Tel Aviv square, where a small number of parents quietly lined up with their children to get shots. The campaign will go nationwide on Tuesday.
""The kids go to school, they (mix) with (other) kids, and they are doing a lot of social activities. We are very excited (to) vaccinate them and get (back) to normal life,"" said Katy Bai Shalom, whose son and daughter were vaccinated Monday.
Receiving their shots in front of television cameras, some of the children smiled and laughed, while others teared up and held on to their parents.
Israel's 9.4 million population is relatively young, with around 1.2 million children in the 5-to-11 age group. By November, that group comprised more than a third of new cases, according to health ministry data. Scientists and officials have been doubtful the country can reach ""herd immunity"" unless children are vaccinated.
Policy makers also say that the vaccination of younger children is meant first and foremost to protect their individual health and not just to stop the transmission of the virus.
In the past week they have stressed that although COVID-19 is rarely severe among young children and many show no symptoms at all, it can carry risks in the longer term.
Israel's health ministry estimates that one in 3,500 children infected with the coronavirus will later develop Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in which parts of the body become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin and gastrointestinal organs. Most children who suffer from the condition require intensive care treatment and 1-2% die.
Officials have also noted the risk of lingering symptoms, such as sleep disruption, muscle pain, loss of smell and taste, headaches and a cough, commonly known as ""long Covid"".
A survey by the health ministry of more than 13,000 children showed that around 11% had suffered lingering symptoms, with about 1.8% to 4.6%, depending on their age, continuing to experience symptoms six months after becoming ill.
A poll by Israeli healthcare provider Maccabi found that 41% of parents to children age 5 to 11 were positive they will vaccinate their children, while 21% were still undecided and 38% will not vaccinate their children.
Israel has recorded 1.3 million total confirmed cases and more than 8,000 dead since the start of the pandemic.
Around 57% of Israel's population is fully vaccinated, according to the health ministry, which means they have either received a third shot or it has not yet been five months since they received their second.",0
701,"CHISINAU, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Moldovagaz received a notification from Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) threatening to cut off gas supplies to the country within 48 hours unless Moldova pays $73 million for recent deliveries, the head of Moldovagaz told Reuters on Monday.
Haggling over a new long-term energy supply deal between Moldova and Russia had tipped the small eastern European nation into an energy crisis last month that appeared to be resolved when both sides struck a new deal.  read more 
But on Monday Gazprom's spokesperson announced the notification of a potential supply cutoff if it did not receive the payment due on Monday. 
""I confirm that Moldovagaz received such a notification from Gazprom,"" the head of the state energy company Moldovagaz, Vadim Ceban, told Reuters.
""The sum is 1.3 billion Moldovan lei ($73.69 million). We are actively working with the government to solve the problem by the deadline stipulated in the notification. I hope that we will manage to solve this problem.""
The pro-Western President Maia Sandu's government declared a state of emergency after its gas contract with Gazprom expired at the end of September and the sides tussled over the price and other details of a new deal.
The Kremlin has denied suggestions it was using the negotiations as a way of blackmailing Moldova and extracting political concessions.  read more 
Sandu last week denied that her support for Ukraine and refusal to travel to Moscow, as the opposition had called for, to negotiate a new gas deal had caused the row.  read more

S&P 500 YEAR-END 2022 TARGET 5,100 - GOLDMAN (1307 EST/18507 GMT)
In Goldman Sachs' (GS) latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart note, David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist, is highlighting his S&P 500 (.SPX) year-end 2022 target of 5,100.
He says this represents a 9% price gain from Friday and a total return with dividends of 10%. He says their 3-month and 6-month interim targets are 4,850 (+3%) and 5,000 (+6%) and reflect a supportive equity investment backdrop GS anticipates during 1H.
With this, Kostin offers three recommendations:
(1) Supply chains are starting to normalize and cyclical equities including “reopening” stocks should outperform
(2) Labor market tightness will persist and investors should skip firms with high labor costs relative to EBIT
(3) Bond yields will rise so fast-growing stocks valued entirely on long-term growth expectations would be vulnerable to rising rates or disappointing sales compared with growth stocks that enjoy high margins.

NASDAQ FLIPS TO RED AS GROWTH NAMES TUMBLE (1221 EST/1721 GMT)
The Nasdaq's (.IXIC) early push to a record high completely evaporated as of mid-day trading on Monday, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) also gave back a large portion of its early rise.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had climbed after President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lead the central bank for a second term, with Wall Street lenders rallying on the prospect of interest rate hikes in 2022.
The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield  was also popping back up to the 1.60% area.
Tech (.SPLRCT), chips (.SOX), FANGs (.NYFANG), among recent leaders, have turned red, and growth (.IGX) was suffering its biggest setback vs value (.IVX) in more than a month.

EXISTING HOME SALES: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN (1120 EST/1620 GMT)
Investors began Thanksgiving week by thanking President Joe Biden for keeping Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's steady hand on the tiller of monetary policy, and also expressing gratitude for a bit of better-than-expected economic data in the form of existing home sales.
For the last few months, the housing market has been the has-been of the economic recovery, falling victim to its early stardom.
Mandated lock downs initially sparked a stampede to the suburbs, launching demand - along with home prices - to the moon, a phenomenon resulting in the prospect of home ownership drifting beyond the realm of affordability for many potential buyers.
But the sector has recently shown signs of returning to an even keel.
Sales of pre-owned U.S. homes rose by 0.8% last month to 6.34 million units at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
The number came in 140,000 units above consensus and marked a slight acceleration from September's 0.7% gain.
The uptick helped keep the inventory of homes on the market steady at 2.3 months supply - below the historical average but up from the record low of 1.8 months reached last December.
""Home sales remain resilient, despite low inventory and increasing affordability challenges,"" writes Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist at NAR.
Yun also points out that just as the sector benefited from the pandemic's initial onset, it could be experiencing a second wind due to the current inflation wave.
""Inflationary pressures, such as fast-rising rents and increasing consumer prices, may have some prospective buyers seeking the protection of a fixed, consistent mortgage payment,"" he says.
The easing credit environment has also lent some support, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""For mortgaged buyers, the rebound in sales has been supported by lower rates since their spring peak, and a clear easing in lending standards,"" Shepherdson notes.
The NAR print falls neatly inline with other recent housing data, particularly the 4% increase in building permits and a rebound in homebuilder sentiment, both released last week.
While economic data holds a rear view mirror to recent activity, the stock market provides a forward-looking indicator, reflecting where investors see the housing sector six months to a year down the road.
Housing stocks - namely the Philadelphia SE Housing index (.HGX) and the S&P 1500 Home Building index (.SPCOMHOME) - handily outperformed the broader market as the global health crisis took its toll.
But as illustrated by the graphic below, over the last 12 months the HGX and the SPCOMHOME indexes are now essentially neck-and-neck with the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX).
Wall Street has grown greener as the morning progresses, with all three major indexes notching healthy gains in a broad rally.
Small caps (.RUT), chips (.SOX) and transports (.DJT) are leading the charge, all signs of economic optimism.

BANK SHARES CHEER LOUDEST FOR POWELL SECOND TERM (1050 EST/1550 GMT)
Shares of the biggest U.S. bank stocks (.SPXBK) are outperforming the broader market on Monday after the White House said it would nominate current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term while for vice chair, it picked Lael Brainard, the Fed board member who was seen as the other main contender for the top job.  read more 
""There's some consensus on the Street that Brainard is pretty far left of Powell in terms of her political views and would be a lot tougher on the banks via regulation and via scrutiny around mergers and acquisition activity,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York which specializes in trading financial stocks.
""It's a little bit of an initial relief rally that Powell is a little bit more of a Wall Street friendly choice.""
While Biden has yet to fill three Fed seats, including vice chair for supervision, a key role for bank regulation, investors seemed confident that Powell would be able to set the tone for regulation.
Grant said it was somewhat unusual for a Fed chair to be re-nominated by a Democratic president after being originally signed up by a Republican president.
""He's found a way to kind of navigate both sides of the aisle pretty well. And I think there's a quorum that he's a strong leader during a tough time."" he said.
""He's been the leader of the Fed during a very tumultuous time with COVID. He navigated the (former President Donald) Trump situation fairly well, which was sloppy and nasty at times,"" said Grant. ""People just generally feel better about the direction of the economy under Powell.""
The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) is up 2.4% and on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 23. Among the biggest percentage gainers in the group are SVB Financial (SIVB.O), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and People United Financial (PBCT.O).

U.S. SHARE BUYBACKS HIT RECORD IN Q3 (0921 EST/1421 GMT)
S&P 500 (.SPX) companies have made record quarterly share repurchases in Q3 2021, amounting to $225 billion, topping the previous record of $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.
Given the annual record of $806 billion set in 2019, a December quarter buyback as well as the remaining unreported Q3 of $204 billion in repurchases would set a new annual record, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note on Saturday. The 12-month high is $823 billion, set in the 12-months ending in March, 2019.
""At this point, I've penciled in a new annual record, with a new 12-month record being in the works,"" Silverblatt said.
Buybacks have roared back this year after bottoming out at $89 billion in the second quarter of last year as the U.S. economy shutdown due to the pandemic.

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT)
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.
Meanwhile, the IXIC ended at an all-time high on Friday. That makes 46 record closes so far in 2021 vs 55 for all of last year.
However, one measure of the Composite's internal strength has once again broken down:
After hitting a high of 75.7% earlier this month, which was well shy of its 2021 peaks, the Nasdaq New High/New Low (NH/NL) index fell to 53.3% on Friday. That was its weakest reading, with the IXIC at a record close, since Aug. 30. Back then, five trading days later, the Composite topped and then slid as much as 8% into its October trough.
Of note, just since early 2020, there have been five sharp IXIC declines from record high-territory, averaging about 15%, all of which were preceded by multi-week/multi-month NH/NL index divergence.
Unless this measure can at least reclaim its descending 10-day moving average, the risk is that it continues to trend down to test the 2020 trough, which was at 1.2%.
Additionally of note, last week saw three Hindenburg Omens triggered on the Nasdaq, and two on the NYSE Composite (.NYA). 
These clusters can highlight an especially fractured market, vulnerable to instability.

704,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Top U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) has bought a 25% stake in Pure Watercraft, valuing the electric boat startup at $600 million, the companies said on Monday.
GM is offering $150 million in a combination of cash and payment-in-kind, which includes access to the automaker's components and assistance with manufacturing, in exchange for the stake, Pure Watercraft said.
Founded in 2011, Seattle-based Pure Watercraft makes electric motors for boats powered by lithium-ion batteries and uses a plug-and-play design mechanism that allows for any boat hull to use its motors.
""Building upon GM's existing efforts to deploy our technology across rail, truck and aerospace industries, the combined expertise of these two enterprises should result in future zero-emissions marine product offerings,"" Dan Nicholson, vice president of GM's Global Electrification unit, said in a statement.

705,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has granted British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell permission to call a psychologist who specializes in how memories can become distorted over time to testify at her trial on sex abuse charges.
Lawyers for Maxwell, who is accused by prosecutors of recruiting and grooming underage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to abuse, have said they planned to call American psychologist Elizabeth Loftus to testify about ""false memories"" of sexual abuses that people may describe with confidence without deliberately lying.
Loftus, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, has testified at hundreds of trials, including as a defense witness in real estate heir Robert Durst's murder trial and former movie producer Harvey Weinstein's trial on rape and sexual assault charges. Both were convicted.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said she would allow Loftus' testimony in an order released on Monday. Opening statements in the trial begin on Nov. 29.
Federal prosecutors had asked Nathan to restrict Loftus' testimony, calling some of her opinions ""unreliable.""
In particular, they cited her opinion that information people hear about an event can alter their memories of that event.
Nathan said she would admit some testimony from Loftus and Park Dietz, another psychologist the defense has offered as an expert, without saying which testimony was admissible.
Dietz is expected to rebut the testimony of prosecution witness Lisa Rocchio, a psychologist expected to discuss how underage sexual abuse victims are ""groomed"" by their predators.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes.
Prosecutors have said Maxwell encouraged girls to give Epstein ""sexualized massages.""
Epstein died by suicide at 66 in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse allegations.",0
706,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Michael Cohen, the onetime personal lawyer and fixer for former U.S. President Donald Trump, walked out of federal court a free man on Monday at the end of his three-year sentence for campaign finance violations and other crimes.
Cohen, 55, told reporters outside the U.S. District Court in Manhattan that he remained under supervised release for three years and intended to work with law enforcement to ""ensure that others are held responsible for their dirty deeds and no one is ever believed to be above the law"".
Minutes later he tweeted a photograph of himself grinning as he displayed his release paperwork.
""This is what freedom finally looks like!"" Cohen said on Twitter alongside a photograph of himself, his hair greying and wearing a black winter jacket and blue jeans. He was seated behind the steering wheel of a car.
Cohen, who represented himself throughout the criminal proceeding, pleaded guilty in December 2018 to campaign finance wrongdoing, tax evasion and other violations. 
COVID-19's devastating effects on the U.S. prison population resulted in Cohen's early release from a federal facility in New York state. He had spent a little over one year in the Otisville, New York, prison before being sent back to his luxury Park Avenue apartment to serve the rest of his term.
He had sought to end his home confinement on May 29, about six months early, saying he had completed hundreds of hours of work and courses while locked up with many other white collar inmates in Otisville, about 75 miles (120 km) northwest of his apartment.
But a federal judge rejected his request, ordering that he remained confined to his home until Nov. 22, reflecting more than five months of credits for good behavior.",0
707,"POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe, Nov 22 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said violence in Guadeloupe over COVID-19 restrictions had created a ""very explosive"" situation, as a general strike entered a second week on Monday and many stores remained shuttered after nighttime looting.
Hours before Macron's prime minister and lawmakers from the Caribbean archipelago were to hold crisis talks in Paris, there were signs of protests spreading to Martinique, another French overseas territory 190 km (120 miles) south of Guadeloupe.
Compulsory vaccination has touched a nerve in a population that is descended from slaves who worked on French sugar plantations and that during the 20th century was systematically exposed to toxic pesticides used in banana plantations.
""We are descendants of slaves, and for us, control over our bodies is really important,"" said Pamela Obertan, 40, a political scientist in Guadeloupe who helped organize protests against vaccine requirements. ""The government wants to impose a medical experiment. We are still medical experiments.""
Agriculture workers in Guadeloupe and Martinique were for decades exposed to a chemical pesticide called chlordecone. Macron has called it an ""environmental scandal"", French media reported in 2018.
The toxic exposure has since then been linked to unusually high rates of prostate cancer on both islands.
Guadeloupe health workers had since July been protesting coronavirus vaccines mandates and writing letters to government officials without getting a response, said Obertan. By Nov. 15, some could no longer work because they had refused the vaccine.
Guadeloupe's main city, Pointe-a-Pitre, was quiet on Monday, with burned out cars and debris still littering streets. Some shops remained shuttered, and schools closed due to the unrest.
Obertan said she and others had led peaceful protests, and did not support the acts of violence that had taken place.
France has deployed 200 extra police officers, including elite police commandos, to Guadeloupe to quell the unrest.
""We must explain, explain, explain and convince, convince, convince, because one must not play around with the peoples' health,"" Macron told reporters in northern France.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday described the situation in Guadeloupe as ""worrying"" and called for calm while also urging solidarity with the island's people.
Local police have arrested several dozen people and food stores and pharmacies have been looted. French media reported on Sunday that rioters had broken into an arms depot in Pointe-a-Pitre and taken rifles.
""We just don't know how far this will still go,"" the mayor of Pointe-a-Pitre told France Info radio. He said there were ""big worries"" on the island now because rioters had guns.
In Martinique, roads around some of the main commercial and industrial zones were blocked by trucks at sunrise as unionised workers responded to a strike call, local media reported.",0
708,"SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov 22 (Reuters) - Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes defended her leadership at the now-defunct blood-testing startup on Monday, telling jurors at her fraud trial she had confidence in the company's technology and had seen positive results from early studies.
Holmes' second day of testimony was part of the defense strategy of showing that she believed Theranos' technology worked, and was not trying to overstate its prospects when raising money from investors.
Holmes, 37, stands accused of lying about Theranos, which had touted technology that could run diagnostic tests faster and more accurately than traditional lab testing with a drop of blood from a finger prick.
Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles starting in 2015 that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate.
In Monday's testimony, Holmes compared a traditional testing machine to a much smaller Theranos device, which she referred to as the 3.0, whose aim was to remove human involvement in blood sample processing.
""If we had the ability to automate much of that process we could reduce the error associated with traditional lab testing,"" Holmes said.
She also testified about studies in 2008 and 2009 in which  she believed Theranos devices performed well, including studies run under agreements with drug companies such as Novartis AG (NOVN.S).
Holmes' decision to testify is risky as it exposes her to a potentially tough cross-examination by prosecutors.
The trial has shone a spotlight on Silicon Valley start-ups, which often attract high valuations based on promises of future success rather than actual revenue and profit streams.
Holmes' lawyers have tried to portray her as a young entrepreneur who underestimated Theranos' obstacles.
More than 50 journalists and spectators arrived at the courthouse early Monday morning to await Holmes' testimony, which began nearly two hours late.
Over the two-month trial, jurors have heard testimony from more than two dozen prosecution witnesses, including patients and investors whom prosecutors say Holmes deceived.
Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine wire fraud counts and two conspiracy counts. Her testimony is scheduled to resume on Tuesday.",0
709,"BRUZGI, Belarus/WARSAW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Europe must not be blackmailed into accepting thousands of migrants stranded on its border with Belarus, Austria said, after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko pressed the bloc to let them in after months of growing tension.
Lukashenko, who denies European Union allegations he fomented the crisis, said he did not want a cross-border clash as that could lead to war, while reiterating that the EU should accept some migrants while Belarus repatriates others.
Poland's border guard said Belarusian forces were still ferrying migrants flown in from the Middle East to the EU frontier, despite clearing camps near the border last week and moving many of the migrants to a warehouse.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, whose country, like other EU neighbours of Belarus, has sent armed reinforcements to the border, said on Sunday that the crisis might be a prelude to ""something much worse"". On Monday Lukashenko said an escalation could be catastrophic.
""We don't want confrontation. We don't need it. Because we understand that if we go too far, war is unavoidable,"" Lukashenko was quoted as saying by state-owned Belta news agency. ""And that will be a catastrophe. We understand this perfectly well. We don't want any kind of flare-up.""
Exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya urged the bloc to get tougher on Minsk, which the EU says flies people in and pushes them to cross via Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in response to sanctions over Lukashenko's crushing of protests against his disputed re-election last year.  read more 
""NO BLACKMAIL""
The plan proposed by Belarus last week would entail EU countries taking in migrants, while Minsk would send another 5,000 back home, and Lukashenko said Belarus was preparing a second migrant repatriation flight at the end of this month.
Faced with an initial rebuff from the bloc, Lukashenko said on Monday he must insist Germany - the preferred destination of many migrants - take in a number of them.
Germany, and others, quickly rejected his renewed call.
""The idea of having a humanitarian corridor to Germany for 2,000 migrants is not a solution that is acceptable to Germany or the EU,"" a government spokesman said on Monday, which  Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg echoed in a joint news conference with Tikhanouskaya.
""The EU must not give in to blackmail from Lukashenko. We have to respond united and very clearly to this state-sponsored hybrid attack on the European Union,"" Schallenberg said.
LANGUAGE OF POWER
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, speaking to reporters after meeting with Lithuanian troops deployed at the border with Belarus, said he was reassured that Germany was not trying to agree any separate deals with Minsk.
""I think the time has come for bilateral contacts to be dropped in favour of multipolar contact, to avoid any suspicions that something happens behind someone's back,"" he said.
Belarus opposition leader Tsikhanouskaya said she could understand that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was trying to help the migrants when she talked with Lukashenko - who had long been shunned by EU leaders - on the phone last week. But she said it still looked ""very strange"" to break his isolation.
""Lukashenko's regime only understands the language of power, they don't understand diplomatic language,"" Tsikhanouskaya said, telling the EU the sanctions it had slapped on Minsk were not effective because there are too many loopholes.
THREAT TO CUT TRAIN LINK
Poland has threatened to sever a train link with Belarus if the situation does not improve, and Lukashenko was quoted as saying that threat could backfire, with rail traffic diverted to run through a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine instead.
Poland's government spokesman said no decision had been taken on the closure, though that option was on the table.
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz said what happened next was up to Lukashenko. ""The EU...can find a way to trade with eastern European and Asian partners without Belarus,"" he told Reuters.
The Polish Economic Institute (PIE) said any closure of the border to train freight would be more costly for Belarus as exports account for up to 70% of its gross domestic product.
Humanitarian agencies say as many as 13 migrants have died at the border, where many have suffered in a cold, damp forest with little food or water as a frigid winter sets in.
A group of around 150 migrants tried to break through the border fence near the Polish village of Dubicze Cerkiewne on Sunday, the Polish border guard said.",0
710,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - The European benchmark price for carbon allowances on Monday hit a record of above 71 euros ($79.79) per tonne, although concerns about new lockdowns to try to curb rising COVID infections in Europe could limit further gains.
The December 21 EUA contract  touched a high of 71.21 euros per tonne, hitting a new record for a sixth consecutive business day.
It traded at 70.13 euros per tonne by 1453 GMT.
Colder weather and less wind power output this week left more room for fossil fuel generation, which could translate into higher demand for EUAs, Refinitiv analyst Ingvild Sorhus said in a morning comment. 
""That said, with Europe being the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, worries over more lockdown measures and lower activity could weigh on markets and also carbon,"" she said, adding that the overall outlook remained bullish.
The carbon market has been boosted by agreement on global carbon trading at the U.N. Climate Summit earlier this month and surging gas prices, that lifted it above technical resistance levels, analysts said.  read more 
High gas prices make it more economic for power companies to burn coal for electricity, which emits twice the amount of carbon dioxide as using gas, requiring more carbon permits.
A report from European financial regulator ESMA last week, found no proof of anti-competitive behaviour in emissions trading. 
Marcus Ferdinand, manager at Oslo-based consultancy Thema, told Reuters by e-mail the report boosted confidence in the market because no immediate intervention from policy makers was expected.
The market should remain structurally bullish, given profitable coal generation and interest from institutional investors, he said, but anticipated a short-term correction based on the likelihood of further COVID restrictions and the market appearing ""overbought now from a technical perspective"".

712,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Guyana is getting ready to raise requirements on oil operators to protect the nation against spills and future removal costs of production platforms, the head of its environmental agency told Reuters.
Guyana currently requires financial assurance, a type of insurance, to cover emergency responses to accidents. Financial assurance is also used at times in some other countries to cover decommissioning infrastructure, especially offshore oil rigs.
But as the newest South American crude-producing nation fashions a regulatory framework for its oil industry, it is pressing a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) for greater security, said Kemraj Parsram, head of Guyana's Environmental Protection Agency, in a interview last week.
Under discussion with Exxon are a draft agreement that would adds parent guarantee and revise the type of events covered in the Exxon group's $5 billion self-insurance policy, he said.
""We have to make sure there is adequate coverage,"" said Parsram.
Exxon does not comment on commercial and regulatory discussions but follows international environmental standards where laws and regulations do not exist and goes beyond those where practical, spokesperson Meghan Macdonald said.
Its existing agreement has ""extensive assurances"" and requires contractors ""take responsibility for any adverse event,"" she said.
The talks with Exxon, the operator in a group that includes Chinese state-run oil company CNOOC (0883.HK) and Hess Corp (HES.N), comes amid environmental permit reviews for a third project in the massive Stabroek block.
""We can make changes to any of those permits, it's what we call new standards,"" he said. ""I would love to have it wrapped up in time for when, if we decide, to approve Yellowtail,"" the third project, Parsram said.
""Insurance is just one of many sources of financing that Exxon Mobil could utilize to pay for response activities, and those activities would not be delayed by discussions with insurers,"" Macdonald said.
Risk mitigation services firm Aon Plc (AON.N) provides insurance for the first two production platforms, covering up to $600 million each for events including well blowouts, evacuations, pollution and spills cleanup, Parsram said.
As Guyana never demanded financial assurance for platform decommissioning, such costs are not covered by the existing policy.
""We will look at that. All that was part of the discussion,"" Parsram said.",0
713,"UNITED NATIONS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The United Nations on Monday pushed for urgent action to prop up Afghanistan's banks, warning that a spike in people unable to repay loans, lower deposits and a cash liquidity crunch could cause the financial system to collapse within months.
In a three-page report on Afghanistan's banking and financial system seen by Reuters, the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said the economic cost of a banking system collapse - and consequent negative social impact - ""would be colossal.""
An abrupt withdrawal of most foreign development support after the Taliban seized power on Aug. 15 from Afghanistan's Western-backed government has sent the economy into freefall, putting a severe strain on the banking system which set weekly withdrawal limits to stop a run on deposits.
""Afghanistan's financial and bank payment systems are in disarray. The bank-run problem must be resolved quickly to improve Afghanistan's limited production capacity and prevent the banking system from collapsing,"" the UNDP report said.
Finding a way to avert a collapse is complicated by international and unilateral sanctions on Taliban leaders.
""We need to find a way to make sure that if we support the banking sector, we are not supporting Taliban,"" Abdallah al Dardari, head of UNDP in Afghanistan, told Reuters.
""We are in such a dire situation that we need to think of all possible options and we have to think outside the box,"" he said. ""What used to be three months ago unthinkable has to become thinkable now.""
Afghanistan's banking system was already vulnerable before the Taliban came to power. But since then development aid has dried up, billions of dollars in Afghan assets have been frozen abroad, and the United Nations and aid groups are now struggling to get enough cash into the country.
The United States is working with the United Nations, UNDP and other international institutions and countries ""to find ways to offer liquidity, to infuse, to see to it that the people of Afghanistan can take advantage of international support in ways that don't flow into the coffers of the Taliban,"" said State Department spokesman Ned Price.
'UNDER THE MATTRESS'
The UNDP's proposals to save the banking system include a deposit insurance scheme, measures to ensure adequate liquidity for short- and medium-term needs, as well as credit guarantees and loan repayment delay options.
""Coordination with the International Financial Institutions, with their extensive experience of the Afghan financial system, would be critical to this process,"" UNDP said in its report,  referring to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The United Nations has repeatedly warned since the Taliban took over that Afghanistan's economy is on the brink of a collapse that would likely further fuel a refugee crisis. UNDP said that if the banking system fails, it could take decades to rebuild.
The UNDP report said that with current trends and withdrawal restrictions, about 40% of Afghanistan's deposit base will be lost by the end of the year. It said banks have stopped extending new credit, and that non-performing loans had almost doubled to 57% in September from the end of 2020.
""If this rate continues of non-performing loans, the banks may not have a chance to survive in the next six months. And I am being optimistic,"" al Dardari said.
Liquidity has also been a problem. Afghan banks heavily relied on physical shipments of U.S. dollars, which have stopped. When it comes to the local afghani currency, al Dardari said that while there is about $4 billion worth of afghanis in the economy, only about $500 million worth is in circulation.
""The rest is sitting under the mattress or under the pillow because people are afraid,"" he said.
As the United Nations seeks to avert famine in Afghanistan, al Dardari also warned about the consequences of a banking collapse for trade finance.
""Afghanistan last year imported about $7 billion worth of goods and products and services, mostly foodstuff ... If there is no trade finance the interruption is huge,"" he said. ""Without the banking system, none of this can happen.""",0
714,"BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Baidu Inc (9888.HK) said on Monday it has licensed its algorithm for messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence to Sanofi SA for use in designing vaccine and therapeutic products, entering its first such commercial deal with a major global drugmaker.
Sanofi (SASY.PA) had been one of the world's biggest vaccine makers before the pandemic, but the French firm was beaten by rivals BioNTech /Pfizer (PFE.N) and Moderna (MRNA.O) in developing mRNA shots against COVID-19.  read more 
Sanofi stopped trials of its own mRNA COVID-19 shot in September, and is instead focusing on efforts with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) to bring another COVID-19 vaccine candidate to market based on the more conventional protein-based approach.
The French group said it would focus its mRNA resources on other infectious diseases and therapeutics with strong unmet need.
Baidu will receive milestone payments when any mRNA-based therapy or vaccine candidate discovered by Sanofi using its algorithm enters clinical trials, said Huang Liang, a Baidu scientist leading the project.
""The fact that this agreement includes milestone payments shows that [Sanofi] has great confidence in bringing candidates developed with Baidu algorithm into clinical trials and to the market,"" Huang told Reuters. He declined to disclose the size of the deal.
An mRNA-based vaccine contains mRNA sequence which instructs human cells to produce proteins that can spur the immune system into action.
Baidu's algorithm is designed to deliver a larger number of optimised mRNA sequences and there are early signs that it could be more suitable than standard algorithms in vaccine and therapeutic drug development, Huang said.
Specifically regarding COVID-19 vaccine candidates, those containing mRNA sequences generated by Baidu's algorithm were more stable and appeared to require a smaller dosage than a baseline shot based on a standard algorithm, according to lab studies and animal tests, which haven't gone through peer-review.",0
715,"KATHMANDU, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The resumption of India supplying COVID-19 vaccines to the global COVAX vaccine-sharing platform after eight months was delayed on Monday when Nepal requested a postponement, two sources told Reuters.
The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, was scheduled to ship Covishield doses through COVAX to Nepal on Monday, but the country now wants them only around Nov. 29, said one of the sources, a Nepal health ministry official.
He declined to explain the reasons for the delay. Neither  source wanted to be named ahead of vaccine delivery, expected to be in hundreds of thousands of doses.
A Nepal health ministry spokesperson had no immediate comment. SII, whose licensed version of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine is known as Covishield, did not respond to a request for comment.
SII last supplied to COVAX in the middle of April before India stopped all vaccine exports to meet its own demand as infections soared. The company has a deal to sell hundreds of millions of vaccines doses to COVAX, which distributes shots to low and medium-income countries.
Before the ban, SII sent a total of about 20 million Covishield doses to various countries through COVAX and many more doses as part of the Indian government's vaccine grants programme.
India last month sent around 4 million vaccine doses bilaterally to its friends and neighbours after domestic output surged. SII has nearly quadrupled Covishield production to up to 240 million doses a month from its April levels.  read more ",0
716,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday canceled his decision to allow Ohio ratepayers to sue electric utility FirstEnergy Corp as a class over claims they were wrongly charged on their electricity bills to bail out failing nuclear power plants in the state.
U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus in Columbus vacated his Nov. 9 decision certifying a class of Ohio residents who were charged a monthly surcharge for electricity under a state law, House Bill 6, designed to raise about $1 billion to subsidize plants owned by a former FirstEnergy subsidiary.
The unusual move followed FirstEnergy lawyers arguing that a scheduling mishap had stripped them of a chance to oppose the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.
Sargus' certification order described Ohio resident Jacob Smith's and his co-plaintiffs' motion for class certification as ""unopposed."" But FirstEnergy said in court papers after the ruling that ""the motion is very much opposed.""
""The Court issued [the certification order] before Defendants' response to the motion was due,"" FirstEnergy's lawyers wrote.
Sargus wrote that the confusion stemmed from FirstEnergy and its co-defendants violating an earlier scheduling order by failing to depose the plaintiffs in time.
""Nevertheless, this Court endeavors, whenever possible, to decide issues on the merits,"" the judge wrote as he vacated the class certification.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jennifer Young, a FirstEnergy spokesperson, said the company is ""unable to comment on pending litigation.""
The cases are Smith v. FirstEnergy Corp. et al; Hudock et al v. FirstEnergy Corp. et al; James Buldas v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al; U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Nos. 2:20-cv-3755; 2:20-cv-3954; 2:20-cv-3987.

717,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Central banks in developing economies ramping up interest rates will be supportive for emerging market debt and provide a buffer against policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, but could spell trouble for equities, BlackRock said on Monday.
""Central banks across the emerging world have been raising interest rates to try to contain inflation and prevent their currencies from depreciating sharply,"" said Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute at the world's largest asset manager.
Central banks in developing nations around the globe - from Brazil to Russia and South Korea have ramped up rates in recent months.
A weighted average of policy rates across emerging markets that are part of JPMorgan's GBI-EM global diversified index now stands at 3.2% and is expected to rise to just under 5% in a year's time. This compares to near zero or negative rates in the United States and euro area, BlackRock calculated, adding this showed ""much of the work is done"" in emerging markets.
However, the proactive approach from emerging central banks was also pressuring growth already hurting from a delayed vaccine rollout, BlackRock said.
""This makes us cautious on EM equities, but has made selected EM debt more attractive in a world starved for yield.""
Within emerging market fixed income, local-currency debt offered the best opportunities thanks to low duration and sensitivity to rising rates, BlackRock said.
""It gives exposure to regions that make up a small share of EM equity indexes, such as LatAm,"" it said.
""We prefer local-currency bonds of higher-yielding countries with solid current account balances,"" Wei Li said, adding the asset manager was also overweight Chinese government bonds for their high yields.",0
718,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry moved into the director's chair for the first time for new drama ""Bruised,"" a film she also stars in as a washed-up mixed martial arts fighter who attempts to revive her career.
Berry said it took her years to get the movie to the screen, and she undertook intense physical training of up to five hours a day to prepare for fight scenes. The film is currently playing in a limited number of theaters and will be released on Netflix (NFLX.O) on Wednesday.
""I knew that I would spend more time, more energy, more hours working on something than I'd ever worked on in my entire career,"" she said in an interview with Reuters. ""It proved to be true. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done.""
British actress Sheila Atim, who co-stars as the trainer of Berry's character, said ""Bruised"" is about finding yourself.
""The characters in this story are just trying to find a way through the hand that they've been dealt,"" Atim said. ""And some people navigate that better than others for different reasons.""
After decades in the entertainment industry and winning an Oscar for 2001 film ""Monster's Ball,"" Berry said people are often surprised that she still finds the entertainment industry tough to navigate.
""I get that most people would think that somehow it's easy for me,"" Berry said.
""As a black woman, the struggle is real,"" she added.""It's still real. Nothing has ever been given to me in my entire career, and I still have to fight for things. And while sometimes I wish I didn't have to, I'm also grateful that I can.""",0
719,"BEIJING/HONG KONG Nov 22 (Reuters) - Almost half a tonne of meteorites declared as pyrite ore on import have been seized by authorities in the southern city of Shenzhen, China's customs agency said on Monday.
Officers inspected the material and determined it was inconsistent with the characteristics of pyrite, the General Administration of Customs said in a statement, adding that the company involved was unable to provide relevant certification.
Pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulphide mineral used in the paper and jewellery industries.
A professional appraisal revealed the 470 kg shipment consisted of 90% iron and 8.9% nickel but lacked the sulphur content that pyrite has, said the statement, which was accompanied by a video of customs officers inspecting a number of brownish rocks.
The appraisal also found the rocks' composition was very similar to that of meteorites, and the owner of the shipment subsequently confirmed that is exactly what they were, customs said，adding that the case was under further processing.
It was not immediately clear how the owner had come into possession of the meteorities.

720,"GENEVA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A United Nations human rights expert said on Monday that electoral laws in some parts of the United States including Texas may undermine democracy by depriving millions of citizens who belong to minority groups of the equal right to vote.
Fernand de Varennes, the U.N. special rapporteur on minority issues, speaking on the final day of a two-week visit to the United States, decried a Texas law that he said resulted in ""gerrymandering"" and dilution of voting rights of minorities in favour of white Americans.
""There is in fact what could be described as an undermining of democracy with a phenomenal number of legislative measures in different parts of the country...which certainly have the effect of making the exercise of the right to vote more difficult for certain minorities,"" he told a news briefing.
""It is becoming unfortunately apparent that it is almost a tyranny of the majority where the minority right to vote is being denied in many areas,"" he added.
De Varennes called for a ""New Deal"" to overhaul legislation. There was no immediate U.S. reaction to his preliminary observations which de Varennes said he had shared with U.S. State Department officials earlier in the day.
Democrats have made election reform a priority in light of Republican state-balloting restrictions passed in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election.
At least 19 states have passed laws making it harder to vote, according to the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Republicans in Congress have blocked proposed legislation multiple times this year.
The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Texas this month over its law that curbs voting by mail, in the latest effort by the Biden administration to combat new voting restrictions.  read more

721,"MADRID, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Spain's main ruling Socialist party demanded explanations on Monday from the leader of the conservative People's Party after Pablo Casado attended a religious service for the late dictator Francisco Franco, whose legacy still divides Spain.
""We consider this an aggression, an absolute irresponsibility,"" Hector Gomez, spokesman for the Socialist bench in Congress, told reporters.
""We demand an explanantion...whether the leader of the opposition, the leader of People's Party is endorsing Francisco Franco's dictatorship,"" he said.
Casado's party said he had been unaware that the mass in the southern city of Granada, which he attended on Saturday with his family, was one of several services held across Spain to commemorate the 46th anniversary of Franco's death.
""It was not a mass for Franco, it was a normal mass, and we discovered the following day,"" a spokesman said, declining further comment.
According to a party source, Casado simply walked into a church next to his hotel because he knew he would not be able to go to a mass the following day due to his tight schedule.
The Francisco Franco Foundation thanked him for his presence there but said he had not been invited and could not be held responsible.
Pablo Echenique of the leftist Unidas Podemos party said he doubted the incident was a coincidence:
""Yes it can be bad luck, but on Nov. 20 there were 10 masses for Franco in all of Spain and there are 23,000 churches...the chance of attending one for Franco is 0.05%,"" he said.
More than half a million people died during the 1936-39 civil war and an estimated 150,000 were killed later in repression by Franco's government, historians estimate.
Last week, the Socialist-led leftist ruling coalition that has long pressed to eradicate Francoist symbols across Spain, sought to bring down long-standing legal barriers to investigating crimes committed during the civil war and the 1939-1975 dictatorship. ",0

NASDAQ FLIPS TO RED AS GROWTH NAMES TUMBLE (1221 EST/1721 GMT)
The Nasdaq's (.IXIC) early push to a record high completely evaporated as of mid-day trading on Monday, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) also gave back a large portion of its early rise.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had climbed after President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lead the central bank for a second term, with Wall Street lenders rallying on the prospect of interest rate hikes in 2022.
The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield  was also popping back up to the 1.60% area.
Tech (.SPLRCT), chips (.SOX), FANGs (.NYFANG), among recent leaders, have turned red, and growth (.IGX) was suffering its biggest setback vs value (.IVX) in more than a month.
Here is where markets stand approaching the halfway mark of the trading day:

EXISTING HOME SALES: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN (1120 EST/1620 GMT)
Investors began Thanksgiving week by thanking President Joe Biden for keeping Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's steady hand on the tiller of monetary policy, and also expressing gratitude for a bit of better-than-expected economic data in the form of existing home sales.
For the last few months, the housing market has been the has-been of the economic recovery, falling victim to its early stardom.
Mandated lock downs initially sparked a stampede to the suburbs, launching demand - along with home prices - to the moon, a phenomenon resulting in the prospect of home ownership drifting beyond the realm of affordability for many potential buyers.
But the sector has recently shown signs of returning to an even keel.
Sales of pre-owned U.S. homes rose by 0.8% last month to 6.34 million units at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
The number came in 140,000 units above consensus and marked a slight acceleration from September's 0.7% gain.
The uptick helped keep the inventory of homes on the market steady at 2.3 months supply - below the historical average but up from the record low of 1.8 months reached last December.
""Home sales remain resilient, despite low inventory and increasing affordability challenges,"" writes Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist at NAR.
Yun also points out that just as the sector benefited from the pandemic's initial onset, it could be experiencing a second wind due to the current inflation wave.
""Inflationary pressures, such as fast-rising rents and increasing consumer prices, may have some prospective buyers seeking the protection of a fixed, consistent mortgage payment,"" he says.
The easing credit environment has also lent some support, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""For mortgaged buyers, the rebound in sales has been supported by lower rates since their spring peak, and a clear easing in lending standards,"" Shepherdson notes.
The NAR print falls neatly inline with other recent housing data, particularly the 4% increase in building permits and a rebound in homebuilder sentiment, both released last week.
While economic data holds a rear view mirror to recent activity, the stock market provides a forward-looking indicator, reflecting where investors see the housing sector six months to a year down the road.
Housing stocks - namely the Philadelphia SE Housing index (.HGX) and the S&P 1500 Home Building index (.SPCOMHOME) - handily outperformed the broader market as the global health crisis took its toll.
But as illustrated by the graphic below, over the last 12 months the HGX and the SPCOMHOME indexes are now essentially neck-and-neck with the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX).
Wall Street has grown greener as the morning progresses, with all three major indexes notching healthy gains in a broad rally.
Small caps (.RUT), chips (.SOX) and transports (.DJT) are leading the charge, all signs of economic optimism.

BANK SHARES CHEER LOUDEST FOR POWELL SECOND TERM (1050 EST/1550 GMT)
Shares of the biggest U.S. bank stocks (.SPXBK) are outperforming the broader market on Monday after the White House said it would nominate current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term while for vice chair, it picked Lael Brainard, the Fed board member who was seen as the other main contender for the top job.  read more 
""There's some consensus on the Street that Brainard is pretty far left of Powell in terms of her political views and would be a lot tougher on the banks via regulation and via scrutiny around mergers and acquisition activity,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York which specializes in trading financial stocks.
""It's a little bit of an initial relief rally that Powell is a little bit more of a Wall Street friendly choice.""
While Biden has yet to fill three Fed seats, including vice chair for supervision, a key role for bank regulation, investors seemed confident that Powell would be able to set the tone for regulation.
Grant said it was somewhat unusual for a Fed chair to be re-nominated by a Democratic president after being originally signed up by a Republican president.
""He's found a way to kind of navigate both sides of the aisle pretty well. And I think there's a quorum that he's a strong leader during a tough time."" he said.
""He's been the leader of the Fed during a very tumultuous time with COVID. He navigated the (former President Donald) Trump situation fairly well, which was sloppy and nasty at times,"" said Grant. ""People just generally feel better about the direction of the economy under Powell.""
The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) is up 2.4% and on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 23. Among the biggest percentage gainers in the group are SVB Financial (SIVB.O), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and People United Financial (PBCT.O).

The rate-sensitive S&P 500 financials (.SPSY) are up more than 1% and leading sector gains along with technology (.SPLRCT), also up more than 1%.

U.S. SHARE BUYBACKS HIT RECORD IN Q3 (0921 EST/1421 GMT)
S&P 500 (.SPX) companies have made record quarterly share repurchases in Q3 2021, amounting to $225 billion, topping the previous record of $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.
Given the annual record of $806 billion set in 2019, a December quarter buyback as well as the remaining unreported Q3 of $204 billion in repurchases would set a new annual record, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note on Saturday. The 12-month high is $823 billion, set in the 12-months ending in March, 2019.
""At this point, I've penciled in a new annual record, with a new 12-month record being in the works,"" Silverblatt said.
Buybacks have roared back this year after bottoming out at $89 billion in the second quarter of last year as the U.S. economy shutdown due to the pandemic.

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT)
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.
Meanwhile, the IXIC ended at an all-time high on Friday. That makes 46 record closes so far in 2021 vs 55 for all of last year.
However, one measure of the Composite's internal strength has once again broken down:
After hitting a high of 75.7% earlier this month, which was well shy of its 2021 peaks, the Nasdaq New High/New Low (NH/NL) index fell to 53.3% on Friday. That was its weakest reading, with the IXIC at a record close, since Aug. 30. Back then, five trading days later, the Composite topped and then slid as much as 8% into its October trough.
Of note, just since early 2020, there have been five sharp IXIC declines from record high-territory, averaging about 15%, all of which were preceded by multi-week/multi-month NH/NL index divergence.
Unless this measure can at least reclaim its descending 10-day moving average, the risk is that it continues to trend down to test the 2020 trough, which was at 1.2%.
Additionally of note, last week saw three Hindenburg Omens triggered on the Nasdaq, and two on the NYSE Composite (.NYA). 
These clusters can highlight an especially fractured market, vulnerable to instability.

723,"(Reuters) - U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has received an ethics waiver to allow her to work on the Harvard University student admissions case at the U.S. Supreme Court despite having earlier served as a guest lecturer at the law school.
The U.S. Justice Department said in its Nov. 18 waiver that Prelogar has ""unique qualifications to meet the government's needs in this particular matter"" as a veteran appellate lawyer whose career includes both public and private service.
The Biden administration's ethics rules bar covered officials, including certain lawyers and lobbyists, from touching matters that involved their former firms or clients for two years after appointment to the government. The waiver for Prelogar only applies to the Harvard admissions case specifically.
A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday, and neither did William Consovoy of the litigation boutique Consovoy McCarthy, which represents the plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions Inc in the admissions lawsuit.
The Justice Department was invited in June at the Supreme Court to file a brief in the case, which challenges Harvard's race-conscious admissions process for undergraduate student admissions.
""The case is high profile and of considerable importance to the Department and the Administration. It raises a constitutional question that may have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on universities across the nation,"" DOJ's Lee Lofthus, the department's designated ethics official, wrote in the waiver. ""The importance of this potentially precedent-making case increases the importance of your participation to the government.""
Prelogar joined the Biden Justice Department in January as the principal deputy solicitor general. She was confirmed last month as the U.S. solicitor general. Prelogar arrived at DOJ from Cooley, where she had been a partner since January 2020.
Prelogar served as a consultant to Harvard Law from August 2011 to March 2020, and she was a a lecturer for six months last year, according to a financial disclosure she submitted after joining the Justice Department. She identified her Harvard  salary in 2020 as $7,500.
Noel Francisco, a U.S. solicitor general under former President Donald Trump, received a waiver during his tenure to work on matters involving the law firm Jones Day, including cases in which a firm client, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was a party. He rejoined the firm last year.

724,"PARIS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - French health authorities reported 5,266 daily new COVID-19 infections on Monday, pushing the seven-day moving average of new cases to an almost three-month high.
That average - which smoothes out daily reporting irregularities - rose to 18,479, a level unseen since Aug. 27, from a three-month low of 4,172 on Oct. 10.
It had set a 2021 record of 42,225 in mid-April before falling to a 2021 low of 1,816 at the end of June.
French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said on Sunday the current wave of the pandemic was ""rampant.""
Unlike some of its European peers, France has yet to announce a new batch of restrictive measure to contain the disease, with some experts saying the ongoing wave could hit its climax in the country around Christmas.
The cumulative total of new cases now stands at 7.42 million.
In another sign the virus' spread is speeding up again, the number of people treated in intensive care units for COVID-19 went up by 67 over 24 hours to 1,409, going 1,400 for the first time since Sept. 30.
The total number of patients hospitalised for the disease increased by 300 versus Sunday to 8,338, the highest daily rise since Aug. 23.

Intertrust, which did not name the interested parties, or provide a number thereof, said that each of them had submitted a conditional and non-binding proposal to buy all its issued and outstanding shares at offer prices ranging up to 22 euro per share.
Last week, the company, which offers administrative, fund and private wealth services in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide, entered into exclusive talks over a potential 1.63 billion euro ($1.83 billion) takeover by CVC Capital Partners, which offered 18 euros per outstanding Intertrust share. 
The highest bid would mean a 25.7% premium over Intertrust's Monday closing price of 17.50 euros on the Amsterdam stock exchange, which last week already rose over 40% to align with CVC Capital Partners' offer. 
In the last 30 minutes of Monday trading, Intertrust shares jumped by 4% and volumes spiked, with traders citing increased bid offer chatter.

726,"PRAGUE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned unvaccinated people from hotels, pubs, hairdressers and most public events from Monday after COVID-19 cases filled hospital intensive-care wards, and were mulling harsher steps to stem the resurgent pandemic.
The central European neighbours both acted a step behind Austria, which first set restrictions on unvaccinated people but went for a full lockdown on Monday as the region became the world's latest COVID-19 hotspot.  read more 
Less than a day into the new system, Slovakia signalled it could indeed echo Austria with a three-week lockdown for all as Prime Minister Eduard Heger said he was ""intensively"" looking at the possibility, to be discussed in the cabinet later this week.  read more 
""The prime minister is aware it is necessary to resolve the situation immediately so we can have a calmer Christmas and be able to relax measures in view of the coming tourism season,"" Heger's office said in a statement.
The two countries took the decision to target unvaccinated people last week to encourage inoculations as daily infections hit new records with vaccination rates lagging most European Union peers.
The unvaccinated make up nearly 70% of serious coronavirus illnesses in the Czech Republic and around 80% in Slovakia, according to government data form the two countries - although vaccination, while it greatly reduces the risk of serious illness or death, does not prevent transmission of the virus.
Slovakia has the bloc's third lowest full vaccination rate at 45.3%, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), while 58% of the Czech population was fully vaccinated, also below the EU average of 65.5%.
The infections surge in the Czech Republic comes amid a transfer of power after an October election with both the outgoing and incoming administrations cool to lockdowns, even as the Czech Medical Chamber called for one on Monday.
Many businesses fear a return to harsher restrictions like a year ago when most shops and restaurants had to close doors in the run-up to Christmas holidays.
""I believe that we are going into another lockdown..., so this Christmas will be very similar to the last one,"" Jakub Olbert said at one of the seasonal markets in Prague that he organises and supplies.
He said the number of vendors at other Christmas markets in the Czech capital had already been halved by distancing requirements, hitting business.
The Czech government was due on Monday to discuss calling a state of emergency, allowing it to order medical students to help at strained hospitals.
Under new Czech measures, only people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months can visit restaurants, services or events like sports games.
In large parts of Slovakia, the government ordered restaurants to close to all in-house meals and serve take-out meals only, as well as restricting access to services.
Analysts have so far said the economic hit from the new Czech restrictions could be limited.
Vaclav Starek, president of the country's Association of Hotels and Restaurants, said the main thing was keeping businesses running even if they need to face limitations.",0
727,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Four big unions, including the Service Employees International Union and the Teamsters, urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday to oppose Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) plan to buy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, saying it would reduce competition in the streaming video market.
Amazon announced the $8.45 billion deal in May, saying the purchase of the fabled U.S. movie studio, home to the James Bond franchise, would give it a library of films and TV shows to compete with rivals like Netflix and Disney+.  read more 
The unions, in a report by an entity they support called the Strategic Organizing Center, argued that the deal would bring Amazon's industry-leading streaming library to more than 55,000 titles, with more under development, which would give the company greater incentive to discriminate against rivals. Netflix has the second-greatest number of titles at just under 20,000, the letter said.
""The prospect of Amazon acquiring a trove of additional MGM content to build on Amazon's existing vast library should raise alarm bells,"" the group said. ""With control over MGM's vast library, Amazon may acquire enough market power over streaming content to raise prices for (streaming video-on-demand) SVOD competitors or for SVOD consumers.""
Amazon, which the group said grew exponentially during the  U.S. coronavirus lockdown, has used its streaming service to attract new Prime members. Prime members make up some 68 percent of Amazon shoppers and spend significantly more than non-Prime shoppers, the group said.
The Service Employees International Union, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Communications Workers of America and the United Farmworkers, sent the letter to Holly Vedova, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.
Amazon handily beat back an effort by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union to organize a Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse earlier this year. But unions have continued to organize, with the RWDSU gearing up potentially to try again.  read more ",0

Around 22 billion euros will be spent on E.ON's power and gas distribution network, Europe's largest, and 5 billion on services for its around 50 million customers across the continent, it said at its capital markets day.
The investment programme comes a week after RWE (RWEG.DE), Germany's largest power producer, mapped out a 50 billion euro spending push to expand its renewables capacity, as Europe's energy firms accelerate their green power ambitions.  read more

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for its core business is expected to reach 7.8 billion euros in 2026, which would represent a compound annual growth rate of about 4% from 2021 to 2026, E.ON said.
As part of the five-year plan, E.ON is also targeting 2 billion to 4 billion euros in proceeds from asset sales and partnerships, as well as additional annual savings of 500 million euros by 2026.
CEO Leonhard Birnbaum, in the job since April, did not elaborate on which assets the company could sell and whether a 16.7% stake in uranium enrichment group Urenco (URENC.UL) was also on the list.
E.ON also proposed to pay a dividend of 0.49 euros per share for 2021, up from 0.47 euros for 2020 and in line with the Refinitiv consensus.
Its current dividend policy, which foresees an annual growth rate of up to 5%, will be extended by three years until 2026, it said.

729,"SAN SALVADOR, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Relations between El Salvador and the United States are temporarily on hold due to the Salvadoran government's apparent lack of interest in dialogue, the senior U.S. official in the Central American country said on Monday.
""Obviously we're on a bit of a pause because the government of El Salvador is not giving a signal that it has an interest in our relationship,"" U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Jean Manes said in an interview on local television.
""Again, it's impossible to think that someone has an interest in our relationship when they're using their paid media machine to attack the United States every day,"" added Manes, without naming anyone in particular.
The office of President Nayib Bukele, who frequently criticizes the United States and U.S. politicians in social media, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reiterating bones of contention that have lately dogged bilateral relations, she flagged the dismissal of judges and the attorney general in May, the closure of an anti-corruption body, and the restriction of access to information as U.S. concerns.
""On behalf of the White House, the State Department, we've offered a bridge, and the (Salvadoran) government decided not to take it. As far as we're concerned, we're interested in having the best relationship with El Salvador,"" Manes added.
Manes, who said she had last met with Bukele three weeks ago, announced she would be leaving El Salvador this week to return to her previous job at U.S. Southern Command. Her current deputy, Brendan O'Brien, will assume charge.

""After having carefully considered all of the evidence produced and the submissions made by the parties, the CAS Panel found, in contrast to the Challenged Decision, that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the alleged misconduct had occurred, and therefore, due to the lack of concrete evidence, Nikita Khakimov should not be sanctioned.""

In June Atlantia agreed to sell its 88% stake in Autostrade to a consortium comprising Italian state lender CDP and investment funds Macquarie and Blackstone to end a feud triggered by the collapse in 2018 of a motorway bridge in Genoa, run by the unit, which killed 43 people.
The sale is expected to close by the end of March but the Italian government and its authorities must first approve Autostrade's new tariff plan (PEF) and the agreement that settles the dispute over the bridge disaster. Rome also needs to give its green light to revisions to the motorway contract.
Atlantia is due to pocket more than 8 billion euros ($9 billion) from the disposal of Autostrade, which operates nearly half of Italy's motorway network.

733,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) said Monday it was now transporting more natural gas on its Westcoast natural gas pipeline than at this time in 2020, less than a week after it shut a segment of the pipeline system due to heavy flooding in the British Columbia province.
The pipeline was transporting 1.63 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of natural gas as of Monday, above the 100% of total contracted volume transported last year at this time, Enbridge said in a statement.
British Columbia declared a state of emergency after a phenomenon known as an ""atmospheric river"" brought a month's worth of rain in two days, paralyzing parts of the province and causing shortages of food and fuel.
The flooding has killed at least four people and could become one of Canada's worst natural disasters.
Enbridge said it was able to maintain natural gas service and quickly increase capacity on its Westcoast pipeline system after the extreme weather event.
It had shut down a segment of a 30-inch pipeline, one of the two pipelines that make up its Westcoast natural gas pipeline in British Columbia, as a precautionary measure on Tuesday. The other pipeline had remained operational.  read more 
Customers of natural gas, which is used to heat homes, among other things, were facing reduced supplies after Enbridge shut the pipeline segment, lowering flows to 1.4 bcf/d from up to 1.8 bcf/day normally.

The EU also presented to the former Soviet republics its 1 billion euro plan to support both Afghanistan and its neighbours in areas from basic humanitarian help to migration management.
The EU accuses Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to cross into the bloc via Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed on Minsk over President Alexander Lukashenko's crushing of protests against his disputed re-election last year.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen met foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as well as Turkmenistan's deputy foreign minister in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe.
""I updated ministers on the situation on the borders of the European Union with Belarus and I've requested their support in preventing this instrumentalisation of human beings at the risk of their life: cheating people, convincing them that there is a way to Europe through a flight to Minsk,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told a briefing after the meeting.
Speaking at the same briefing, Urpilainen said she had presented to the former Soviet republics the EU's 1 billion euro Afghan support package, almost half of which is in fact earmarked for neighbouring countries.
She did not say, however, whether Brussels expected them to host any refugees in return - something that local governments have so far expressed little willingness to do.

735,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - American Airlines (AAL.O) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) asked a U.S. judge on Monday to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and six states over the company's ""Northeast Alliance"" partnership.
The suit filed in September alleges the deal would lead to higher fares in busy northeastern U.S. airports and seeks to unwind the alliance. The airlines said Monday the alliance has been in place for nine months but the suit does ""not allege that it has caused a single higher price, any reduction in quality or the slightest reduction in output.""
The Justice Department declined to comment on Monday. The government and airlines on Friday backed a proposed trial date of September 2022 but that schedule has not yet been approved by a U.S. judge.
The partnership was announced in July 2020 and approved by the U.S. Transportation Department (DOT) shortly before the end of the Trump administration. The Justice Department said the alliance would cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.
The airlines argue the Justice Department and states should allow the alliance to continue to prove itself in the market. They note their commitments to expansion, oversight and measures to address possible anticompetitive effects.
The suit also signals the Biden administration's interest in greater competition where American and three other airlines control 80% of the domestic air market.
The agreement allows American and JetBlue to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent flyer programs in a move aimed at giving them more muscle to compete with United Airlines  and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) in the Northeast.
The Justice Department complaint said the partnership at least partially removed JetBlue as a disruptive maverick that would work to drive down prices.",0
736,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Paul Dacre, the veteran former editor of the Daily Mail, has been appointed editor-in-chief of the group's DMG Media business, extending his long association with the British newspaper publisher.
""I am delighted to appoint Paul Dacre, who has a huge and distinguished history with this company,"" said Lord Rothermere, chairman of parent company DMGT Plc (DMGOa.L).
""Although he will not be involved in day-to-day editing, he will be taking an active role advising me and the editors,"" Rothermere added in a statement.
The announcement was a surprise as British media had reported that Dacre, 73, was ending his long association with the newspaper group where he built his reputation.
Dacre helped to turn the Daily Mail tabloid into one of Britain's most influential newspapers over more than two decades before he stepped back from the editing role three years ago.
His successor Geordie Greig announced last week that he was quitting as editor of the daily. He is being replaced by Ted Verity, who was running the Mail on Sunday title.

737,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. bank stocks rose on Monday as senior bankers and industry figures welcomed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's nomination by President Joe Biden for a second four-year term.
A Republican and former private equity lawyer, Powell has long been favored by Wall Street bankers and fund managers who saw him as one of their own, sympathetic to their gripes that the industry has become over-regulated as a result of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Biden, in a statement emailed to reporters, paid tribute to the ""decisive action"" which the Fed had taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  read more 
Senior bankers echoed the presidential praise for Powell's swift and steady hand.
""Chairman Powell has been a steadying force throughout the pandemic and I'm glad to see him continue in this role,"" Christiana Riley, chief executive of Deutsche Bank's (DBKGn.DE) U.S. business, said.
""Consistency at the top of the Federal Reserve is reassuring during this critical point in the post-pandemic recovery.""
The S&P 500 bank index was up 2.6%, on pace for its best day in two months.
Powell presided over a historic run-up in stocks. The S&P 500 has risen around 70% under Powell, fueled in part by extraordinary measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed added $4.4 trillion to its balance sheet during the pandemic, purchasing assets including Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  read more 
Over the past four years, Powell also backed a review led by Fed vice chair for supervision Randal Quarles of key post-crisis regulations, agreeing with Quarles' view that many were too blunt and onerous and should be better tailored to banks' risks.
Among the most contentious changes were revisions to the ""Volcker Rule"" curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual ""stress tests"" based on subjective concerns.
Powell's perceived ""bank-friendly"" agenda had led Democrat progressives to favor Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard, who had won respect from progressives for opposing Quarles' efforts to ease bank regulations.
Brainard has, instead, been appointed vice chair.
One area of lingering concern for banks might be Biden's failure to announce a new regulatory chief to replace current head of supervision Randal Quarles, who stepped down from his role overseeing the country's biggest banks in October.
Brainard had been favorite for that role but did not want it, according to two people familiar with the matter.  read more 
Biden said the supervision post and other Fed picks would be announced in early December.  read more 
Some analysts and investors raised concern that Biden might appoint a candidate with an aggressive regulatory agenda to satisfy progressive Democrats unhappy at Powell's reappointment.  read more 
""The oversight role is still a risk for the banks. And so that's something we're going to pay attention to,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago.
Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, said the best outcome banks can hope for would be a candidate with a similar agenda to Brainard while a politically-motivated appointment could be more negative for banks.
""Higher capital requirements and tougher CCAR (stress tests) are inevitable,"" Seiberg said.
Kevin Fromer, CEO of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the largest eight U.S. banks and their CEOs, congratulated both Powell and Brainard.
""We expect regulators will continue to hold the largest banks to the high regulatory and supervisory standards that have remained in place to support a resilient and essential part of the U.S. financial system.""",0

739,"PARIS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - France's armed forces minister called for an investigation on Monday after a report that secret French intelligence intended to track jihadist militants had been misued by Egypt to target smugglers on the Libyan border and kill civilians.
Investigative website Disclose, which has previously reported on other confidential dealings between Paris and Cairo, published dozens of classified documents which it said showed the misuse of intelligence provided to Egypt by a secret team of four French soldiers and six ex-military personnel.
The team was sent to Egypt on a mission codenamed Operation Sirli in 2016, Disclose reported. At the time, the French military was conducting surveillance flights over Libya, where Islamic State fighters were active and France was concerned their influence could spread.
Disclose said at least 19 bombings against civilians took place between 2016 to 2018 linked to French intelligence given to Cairo. The documents published on Monday included purported messages from those involved on the ground alerting their superiors that their information was being misused.
Reuters could not independently verify the documents, although the French Armed Forces Ministry did not challenge their veracity.
""Egypt is a partner of France with which - as with many other countries - we maintain relations in the field of intelligence and the fight against terrorism,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that it would not comment on the nature of the co-operation.
""In addition, the Minister of the Armed Forces has demanded that an investigation be launched into the information disseminated by Disclose,"" it said. It did not say who would conduct the probe, or whether it aimed to investigate the leaks themselves or the misuse of intelligence they described.
Egyptian government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The office of French President Emmanuel Macron and the French Foreign Ministry both referred queries to the Armed Forces Ministry.
According to Disclose, the French intelligence team was accompanied by an Egyptian officer tasked with listening in to live eavesdropping of conversations. Disclose said the French team quickly realised the terrorist threat was minimal and that its information was instead being used to target people smuggling items, from cigarettes and food to guns and drugs.
One confidential note published on Jan. 22, 2019 addressed to Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly ahead of a visit to Egypt by Macron, said there were ""proven cases of destruction of targets detected by French aircraft"" and it was important to remind Egypt that reconnaissance planes were not a targeting tool.",0

Negotiators from both countries have struggled for more than a year to conclude a trade package as New Delhi and Washington spar over a range of issues, including tariffs.
Accompanied in New Delhi by her deputy Ambassador Sarah Bianchi, Tai raised market access restrictions, high tariffs, unpredictable regulations and restricted digital trade between the two countries.
""These are issues where we intent to make progress and they will be on the top of my list during the visit,"" Tai told Indian officials at a dinner hosted by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.
The meeting follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington in September.
""We have been uniquely tasked by our leaders, PM Modi and President (Joe) Biden, to strengthen our economic ties and trade based on transparency and fairness,"" Goyal said at the dinner.
There was huge potential for growth in areas such as digital economy, health services and agriculture, Tai said.
Both countries have agreed to revive their Trade Policy Forum, after a gap of four years. The revived forum could help expand bilateral trade that has never seemed to live up to its potential, Tai said.
The officials agreed that the forum will help deepen the bilateral trade relationship by establishing regular contact to resolve obstacles, Tai's office said.
U.S.-Indian relations have grown steadily closer and both countries have joined with Japan and Australia in the so-called Quad group in an effort to push back against Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Nornickel is the world's largest producer of palladium and refined nickel. Its first-half core earnings tripled thanks to higher global metals prices and a low-base effect offsetting reduced nickel and copper output. 
Its board of directors recommended the payment of 1,523.17 roubles per share, the miner said in a statement.
It paid 623.35 roubles per share for January-September, 2020, and its total 2020 payout was affected by a $2 billion fine for the 2020 Arctic fuel spill. The miner then compensated part of the decline with a buyback of its shares.  read more 
Interros Holding, owned by Nornickel's chief executive Vladimir Potanin, and aluminium producer Rusal  are Nornickel's largest shareholders with 36% and 26%, respectively.

A third tongue of lava from the Cumbre Vieja volcano, which has been erupting for two months, reached the water around midday (12:00 GMT) a few kilometres north of where two previous flows hit the sea.
Drone footage from the local council showed white clouds billowing out of the water as the red hot molten rock slid down a cliff into the Atlantic.
Residents in Tazacorte, San Borondon and parts of El Cardon were told to stay inside with doors and windows shut as strong winds blew the cloud back inland.

EXISTING HOME SALES: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN (1120 EST/1620 GMT)
Investors began Thanksgiving week by thanking President Joe Biden for keeping Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's steady hand on the tiller of monetary policy, and also expressing gratitude for a bit of better-than-expected economic data in the form of existing home sales.
For the last few months, the housing market has been the has-been of the economic recovery, falling victim to its early stardom.
Mandated lock downs initially sparked a stampede to the suburbs, launching demand - along with home prices - to the moon, a phenomenon resulting in the prospect of home ownership drifting beyond the realm of affordability for many potential buyers.
But the sector has recently shown signs of returning to an even keel.
Sales of pre-owned U.S. homes rose by 0.8% last month to 6.34 million units at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
The number came in 140,000 units above consensus and marked a slight acceleration from September's 0.7% gain.
The uptick helped keep the inventory of homes on the market steady at 2.3 months supply - below the historical average but up from the record low of 1.8 months reached last December.
""Home sales remain resilient, despite low inventory and increasing affordability challenges,"" writes Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist at NAR.
Yun also points out that just as the sector benefited from the pandemic's initial onset, it could be experiencing a second wind due to the current inflation wave.
""Inflationary pressures, such as fast-rising rents and increasing consumer prices, may have some prospective buyers seeking the protection of a fixed, consistent mortgage payment,"" he says.
The easing credit environment has also lent some support, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""For mortgaged buyers, the rebound in sales has been supported by lower rates since their spring peak, and a clear easing in lending standards,"" Shepherdson notes.
The NAR print falls neatly inline with other recent housing data, particularly the 4% increase in building permits and a rebound in homebuilder sentiment, both released last week.
While economic data holds a rear view mirror to recent activity, the stock market provides a forward-looking indicator, reflecting where investors see the housing sector six months to a year down the road.
Housing stocks - namely the Philadelphia SE Housing index (.HGX) and the S&P 1500 Home Building index (.SPCOMHOME) - handily outperformed the broader market as the global health crisis took its toll.
But as illustrated by the graphic below, over the last 12 months the HGX and the SPCOMHOME indexes are now essentially neck-and-neck with the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX).
Wall Street has grown greener as the morning progresses, with all three major indexes notching healthy gains in a broad rally.
Small caps (.RUT), chips (.SOX) and transports (.DJT) are leading the charge, all signs of economic optimism.

BANK SHARES CHEER LOUDEST FOR POWELL SECOND TERM (1050 EST/1550 GMT)
Shares of the biggest U.S. bank stocks (.SPXBK) are outperforming the broader market on Monday after the White House said it would nominate current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term while for vice chair, it picked Lael Brainard, the Fed board member who was seen as the other main contender for the top job.  read more 
""There's some consensus on the Street that Brainard is pretty far left of Powell in terms of her political views and would be a lot tougher on the banks via regulation and via scrutiny around mergers and acquisition activity,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York which specializes in trading financial stocks.
""It's a little bit of an initial relief rally that Powell is a little bit more of a Wall Street friendly choice.""
While Biden has yet to fill three Fed seats, including vice chair for supervision, a key role for bank regulation, investors seemed confident that Powell would be able to set the tone for regulation.
Grant said it was somewhat unusual for a Fed chair to be re-nominated by a Democratic president after being originally signed up by a Republican president.
""He's found a way to kind of navigate both sides of the aisle pretty well. And I think there's a quorum that he's a strong leader during a tough time."" he said.
""He's been the leader of the Fed during a very tumultuous time with COVID. He navigated the (former President Donald) Trump situation fairly well, which was sloppy and nasty at times,"" said Grant. ""People just generally feel better about the direction of the economy under Powell.""
The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) is up 2.4% and on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 23. Among the biggest percentage gainers in the group are SVB Financial (SIVB.O), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and People United Financial (PBCT.O).

POWELL NOMINATION RELIEVES U.S. STOCK INVESTORS (1010 EST/1510 GMT)
The three major U.S. stock indexes are solidly higher in morning New York trading, with the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) hitting record highs, as President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to head the central bank for a second term.
Investors appeared to be cheering the news as a second term for Powell could soothe some worries over a change in the status quo.
The rate-sensitive S&P 500 financials (.SPSY) are up more than 1% and leading sector gains along with technology (.SPLRCT), also up more than 1%.
""My reaction is one of relief. He was a steady hand, I think people liked in general the policies that he enacted since Covid first became an issue,"" said Peter Tuz, president at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

U.S. SHARE BUYBACKS HIT RECORD IN Q3 (0921 EST/1421 GMT)
S&P 500 (.SPX) companies have made record quarterly share repurchases in Q3 2021, amounting to $225 billion, topping the previous record of $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.
Given the annual record of $806 billion set in 2019, a December quarter buyback as well as the remaining unreported Q3 of $204 billion in repurchases would set a new annual record, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note on Saturday. The 12-month high is $823 billion, set in the 12-months ending in March, 2019.
""At this point, I've penciled in a new annual record, with a new 12-month record being in the works,"" Silverblatt said.
Buybacks have roared back this year after bottoming out at $89 billion in the second quarter of last year as the U.S. economy shutdown due to the pandemic.

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT)
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.
Meanwhile, the IXIC ended at an all-time high on Friday. That makes 46 record closes so far in 2021 vs 55 for all of last year.
However, one measure of the Composite's internal strength has once again broken down:
After hitting a high of 75.7% earlier this month, which was well shy of its 2021 peaks, the Nasdaq New High/New Low (NH/NL) index fell to 53.3% on Friday. That was its weakest reading, with the IXIC at a record close, since Aug. 30. Back then, five trading days later, the Composite topped and then slid as much as 8% into its October trough.
Of note, just since early 2020, there have been five sharp IXIC declines from record high-territory, averaging about 15%, all of which were preceded by multi-week/multi-month NH/NL index divergence.
Unless this measure can at least reclaim its descending 10-day moving average, the risk is that it continues to trend down to test the 2020 trough, which was at 1.2%.
Additionally of note, last week saw three Hindenburg Omens triggered on the Nasdaq, and two on the NYSE Composite (.NYA). 
These clusters can highlight an especially fractured market, vulnerable to instability.

747,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The United States and Turkey have agreed to terms for withdrawal of Turkey's digital services tax that largely targeted highly profitable U.S. technology giants and will transition to a new global taxation agreement in 2023, the Treasury said on Monday.
The agreement will allow for the termination of U.S. retaliatory trade measures imposed against Turkey and will take on the same terms agreed by Washington in October with Austria, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, the Treasury said.
A total of 136 countries agreed in principle to withdraw their digital services taxes as part of a sweeping global tax deal agreed on Oct. 8 to adopt a 15% global minimum corporate tax and grant some taxing rights on large profitable companies to market countries.
The United States has not withdrawn its tariff threats against India over its digital services tax, aimed largely at U.S. technology companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O).
Under the agreed withdrawal terms, Turkey and the European countries can continue to collect digital services taxes until the new regime is put in place, but any taxes collected after January 2022 taxes that exceed what companies would have to pay under the new rules would be credited against the firms' future tax liabilities in those countries.",0
748,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O)'s latest spat with Visa (V.N) shows big retailers, armed with a growing array of payment options, are gaining the upper hand in their power struggle with card providers, but it's not a crisis for the payment company.
Amazon said last week that it would stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the United Kingdom from Jan. 19, 2022, saying that despite technology advancements the fees on such transactions remained high or in some cases were rising.
While Amazon may yet back down on the UK front, where the company accounts for less than 1% of Visa's credit card volume, according to an estimate by Piper Sandler analysts, the dispute is a bad sign for the card industry. Some analysts said it could presage a fight in the much bigger U.S. market.
""Amazon is treating this dispute with Visa as an experiment,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat. ""Our biggest concern is that Amazon seeks concessions from Visa in other geographies.""
Visa Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu told Reuters in an interview on Friday that he expected a resolution. ""We've resolved these things in the past and I believe we'll resolve them in the future,"" he said. Amazon declined to comment.
Credit cards dominated a third of North American ecommerce spending in 2020, according to payments giant WorldPay, but mobile payment options like Venmo and 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) financing plans are chipping away at their market share.
While alternative payments have been growing for years, the pandemic accelerated a downward trend in credit card applications boosting the popularity of BNPL financing, especially among younger consumers.
Credit cards' share of North American e-commerce spending declined 7% last year, according to WorldPay, while BNPL's share increased 78%, making it the fastest-growing form of payment.
In August, Amazon partnered with BNPL provider Affirm to offer installment financing option on U.S. Amazon purchases.
""Credit cards are still dominant players for non-cash transactions, but they need to be aware of the growing competition,"" Chris Dinga, payments analyst at GlobalData, wrote on Friday.
""BNPL is gradually being adopted by retailers as they see higher conversion and growth opportunity by providing it to their customers,"" Dinga wrote, adding high credit card fees could accelerate BNPL adoption by retailers.
Some analysts said past disputes suggested Visa may have to blink before Amazon, such as when U.S. restaurant owners stopped taking Amex cards in the 1990s, leading Amex to reduce its fees.
""Visa may need to follow American Express's example,"" Evercore analysts said in a research note.
'AGNOSTIC'
Still, Visa has survived such fights and few other merchants have Amazon's heft, said Prabhu.
""Even a very large retailer like Amazon represents a relatively small portion of our payment volume,"" he said.
And Visa is not wedded to credit cards as the primary transaction source, he added.
""If a merchant wants to offer credit in a different way, we're agnostic. We will do both. The buy now, pay later business has been a positive for us.""
Visa has been partnering with BNPL providers, including Sweden's Klarna.
Retailers also benefit from credit card issuers offering their customers cash rebates and rewards programs to encourage them to spend more than they otherwise would.
Prabhu said he expected credit card spending to pick up now that borders are opening and affluent customers are spending more on travel, entertainment and eating out.
And Amazon also needs a partner for its own co-branded credit card. The company is considering replacing Visa on U.S. co-branded credit cards with either Mastercard or American Express, suggesting its UK fee dispute could be a negotiating tactic, said analysts. 
""It's not necessarily a good idea for merchants to restrict consumer choice,"" said Prabhu. ""Amazon will have to think about that, too.""",0

Dominik Stillhart, operators director for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the charity this week began paying salaries and distributing medical supplies to 18 medical facilities in Afghanistan to prevent them from collapsing.
""I am livid,"" he said on Monday in a statement from Kabul after a six-day field visit to hospitals.
""As winter sets in, policies that were meant to avoid supporting those in power are now instead freezing out millions of Afghans from the very basic needs they require to survive.""
Salaries in government-run hospitals have been unpaid for months, meaning the nurses who have not abandoned their posts are walking to work for two hours because they cannot afford transport, Stillhart told journalists.
""Every single person I spoke to, be it hospital staff, patients, people in the street - they are seriously worried about how to make ends meet in the coming months,"" he said after a visit to a pediatric ward in Kandahar Province.
Cases of severe malnutrition, pneumonia and dehydration have doubled since August and September in the facility, where up to three children are squeezed in each bed, he added.
Stillhart urged donors to find ""creative solutions"", saying the formation of a trust fund might help get money flowing.

751,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index posted a fourth straight day of losses on Monday, as the prospect of higher interest rates next year weighed on technology stocks such as Shopify (SHOP.TO) after Jerome Powell was tapped to continue as Federal Reserve chair.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index (.GSPTSE) ended the day down 134.26 points, or 0.6% at 21,420.77.
The technology subindex (.SPTTTK) was the biggest loser, falling 3%, as its biggest component, Shopify Inc lost 5.2%. Shopify is Canada's most valuable company.
Powell is seen as slightly more hawkish than Governor Lael Brainard, the other top candidate for the job who will be vice chair, said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth Management.
""This indicates to the market that you will see a response out of the Fed perhaps quicker than a Brainard Fed,"" he said. ""That's what's impacting technology to the downside... and in Canada, Shopify can move the market.""
Large technology stocks are generally seen as inflation hedges. In addition, payment processing services like Shopify charge per transaction, so steps by the central bank to tame inflation can be viewed as negative.

753,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Canada has halted exports of fresh potatoes from Prince Edward Island (PEI) to the United States, facing a threat from Washington to ban the shipments over concerns about the potato wart fungus, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Monday.
The agency (CFIA) confirmed the fungus in high levels on two PEI farms in October, the first in 21 years in the province. Potato wart can decrease crop yields but poses no threat to human health or food safety, the CFIA said.
PEI, the smallest Canadian province, is the third-largest potato-producing province after Manitoba and Alberta, growing about 20% of the national harvest in 2020, according to Statistics Canada. The crop is worth more than C$1 billion ($788 million) annually to the province's economy, according to the Prince Edward Island Potato Board.
Canada halted movement of PEI seed potatoes to the United States on Nov. 2. The United States notified Canada that it would ban all imports of PEI fresh potatoes unless Canada took further action.
In response, Canada also suspended exports of fresh PEI potatoes, including potatoes for table use and processing, to the United States. The decision does not apply to processed products.
""I appreciate Canada’s action to suspend the movement of all potatoes from Prince Edward Island to the United States,"" said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""We look forward to working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency as they delimit the infestation and trace the sources so that appropriate mitigation measures can be imposed and trade restrictions relaxed.""
Fresh potatoes can still move to other Canadian provinces, said David Bailey, Canada's acting chief plant health officer.
The situation highlights a difference of opinion between the United States and Canada over the threat the fungus poses.
Canada's new safety measures, such as brushing and washing potatoes to remove soil, makes the risk negligible, Bailey said on a conference call.
""The Americans feel the risk is too high for them,"" he said.
Potato wart was previously detected in the United States, but has since been eradicated, according to CFIA.
Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said she had raised the issue with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and would work to restore trade access.

755,"MOUNT ATHOS, Greece, Nov 22 (Reuters) - In the chapel of a monastery on Greece's Mount Athos, Father Makarios read the gospel while conducting a liturgy as he waited for his anti-coronavirus vaccination.
He knows when to separate religion from science, he says.
""I did have some thoughts about whether (the vaccination) is needed. Of course we have faith in God and God protects us,""  said the 70-year-old monk, who said he had ""approached death"" after catching COVID-19.
""But science is something in the hands of God, God enlightens the scientists so they can protect humanity,"" he said.
Mount Athos is one of the Orthodox Church's most sacred religious sites. The coronavirus has spread like wildfire and a drive is on to vaccinate the some 1,600 monks in the closed community on northern Greece's Halkidiki peninsula.
Nine have died since the start of the pandemic and many in the 20 monasteries have been infected. But vaccination rates remain at about 40% and a relaxation of safety measures has escalated the problem at the popular visitors' site.
Between October and November, at least 100 cases were recorded, said Giorgos Miteloudis, a doctor at the Mount Athos health centre.
""It is exceptionally dangerous in a closed community like a monastery, which is basically like a family, where it is difficult for the members of the family to protect themselves from each other,"" he said.
After seeing others fall ill or catching the virus themselves, at least 30 monks have stepped up to be vaccinated this month. Many who live on Athos are aged over 70 and they  play a special role in the community.
""On Mount Athos the older people are called the elders, the respected elders, they are the guides of spiritual life on Mount Athos. They pass on their personal spiritual wisdom and experiences, even their holiness, and we owe it to protect them,"" Miteloudis said.
More than 1,000 years old, the autonomous Orthodox spiritual centre has scores of small living units along with its monasteries, making it hard to keep track of infections.
Encompassing an entire peninsula jutting into the Aegean Sea, it is forbidden to women and children. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Britain's Prince Charles and several celebrities have made a pilgrimage there.
Athos closed to outside visitors for three months during the last lockdown, reopening this February. Only rapid tests are currently required to enter the site.
But cases in Greece reached new highs this month and hospitals are once again under strain, especially in the north.

756,"PARIS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A resurgence of COVID cases and a jump in inflation do not at this point warrant a change in ECB plans to wind down emergency bond purchases in March, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Monday.
With the European Central Bank's 1.85-trillion-euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) due to expire in March, the ECB is due to decide in December on the its future and another one in place since 2015.
""I don't think current developments change this assessment. From today's perspective, we should end PEPP net purchases in March 2022,"" Villeroy said in an interview with German newspaper Boersen Zeitung.
Since financial markets were largely anticipating its end in March, there was little reason to fear disruptive ""cliff effects"" when it does, he said.
While a jump in COVID cases in some euro zone countries is clouding the economic outlook, a surge in inflation this year has prompted warnings from ECB hawks to not keep monetary policy too loose too long.
Villeroy, who is also head of the French central bank, urged a ""patient and vigilant"" response at the ECB because the euro zone economy was not at risk of falling back into recession and because the inflation ""hump"" was temporary and caused by business bottlenecks.
""A premature tightening would be a mistake... But we also have to be vigilant on both sides... If inflationary forces were to become more persistent, we would not hesitate to act,"" he added.
The fragile bond markets of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece could face a stability test as the PEPP's end looms as it offers the ECB more leeway to buy member states' bonds than the 2015 Asset Purchase Programme (APP).  read more 
While all decisions did not need to be taken in December, Villeroy said increasing post-PEPP bond purchases under the APP was a possibility, although it was not needed at this point.
Nonetheless, there was a general consensus in the ECB's governing council on the direction of monetary policy, and what remained to be determined was the ""timing and the pace along this path"", which depended on the economic and inflation outlook, Villeroy said.",0

Under outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany has benefited from strong business ties with China. But officials are becoming increasingly uneasy about a growing dependency on the world's second-largest economy.

BANK SHARES CHEER LOUDEST FOR POWELL SECOND TERM (1050 EST/1550 GMT)
Shares of the biggest U.S. bank stocks (.SPXBK) are outperforming the broader market on Monday after the White House said it would nominate current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term while for vice chair, it picked Lael Brainard, the Fed board member who was seen as the other main contender for the top job.  read more 
""There's some consensus on the Street that Brainard is pretty far left of Powell in terms of her political views and would be a lot tougher on the banks via regulation and via scrutiny around mergers and acquisition activity,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York which specializes in trading financial stocks.
""It's a little bit of an initial relief rally that Powell is a little bit more of a Wall Street friendly choice.""
While Biden has yet to fill three Fed seats, including vice chair for supervision, a key role for bank regulation, investors seemed confident that Powell would be able to set the tone for regulation.
Grant said it was somewhat unusual for a Fed chair to be re-nominated by a Democratic president after being originally signed up by a Republican president.
""He's found a way to kind of navigate both sides of the aisle pretty well. And I think there's a quorum that he's a strong leader during a tough time."" he said.
""He's been the leader of the Fed during a very tumultuous time with COVID. He navigated the (former President Donald) Trump situation fairly well, which was sloppy and nasty at times,"" said Grant. ""People just generally feel better about the direction of the economy under Powell.""
The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) is up 2.4% and on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 23. Among the biggest percentage gainers in the group are SVB Financial (SIVB.O), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and People United Financial (PBCT.O).

U.S. SHARE BUYBACKS HIT RECORD IN Q3 (0921 EST/1421 GMT)
S&P 500 (.SPX) companies have made record quarterly share repurchases in Q3 2021, amounting to $225 billion, topping the previous record of $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.
Given the annual record of $806 billion set in 2019, a December quarter buyback as well as the remaining unreported Q3 of $204 billion in repurchases would set a new annual record, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note on Saturday. The 12-month high is $823 billion, set in the 12-months ending in March, 2019.
""At this point, I've penciled in a new annual record, with a new 12-month record being in the works,"" Silverblatt said.
Buybacks have roared back this year after bottoming out at $89 billion in the second quarter of last year as the U.S. economy shutdown due to the pandemic.

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT)
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.
Meanwhile, the IXIC ended at an all-time high on Friday. That makes 46 record closes so far in 2021 vs 55 for all of last year.
However, one measure of the Composite's internal strength has once again broken down:
After hitting a high of 75.7% earlier this month, which was well shy of its 2021 peaks, the Nasdaq New High/New Low (NH/NL) index fell to 53.3% on Friday. That was its weakest reading, with the IXIC at a record close, since Aug. 30. Back then, five trading days later, the Composite topped and then slid as much as 8% into its October trough.
Of note, just since early 2020, there have been five sharp IXIC declines from record high-territory, averaging about 15%, all of which were preceded by multi-week/multi-month NH/NL index divergence.
Unless this measure can at least reclaim its descending 10-day moving average, the risk is that it continues to trend down to test the 2020 trough, which was at 1.2%.
Additionally of note, last week saw three Hindenburg Omens triggered on the Nasdaq, and two on the NYSE Composite (.NYA). 
These clusters can highlight an especially fractured market, vulnerable to instability.

762,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - As many as 36 people have contacted Yorkshire's new whistleblower hotline since it was launched last week following the allegations of institutional racism made by former player Azeem Rafiq, the club said on Monday.
Rafiq, a player of Pakistani descent, last week testified before a British parliamentary committee and spoke of the discrimination he faced while at Yorkshire, saying that the sport in England was riddled with racism.
The independent reporting service, which was initiated by new Yorkshire chairman Kamlesh Patel, is being headed by QC of Littleton Chambers Mohinderpal Sethi.
""It has been confirmed that 36 individuals have emailed the hotline since it became operational on Monday, Nov. 15,"" the club said in a statement.
""All communications received by the hotline are being reviewed, and Sethi's team will communicate directly with those who have made contact.
""The club is committed to transparency regarding the volume of contact to the hotline and will share updates regularly, initially weekly.""",0
763,"(Reuters) - Two Democratic and Republican lawmakers in a letter on Monday urged President Joe Biden to prioritize filling vacancies that have left the U.S. Sentencing Commission without a quorum, saying the situation has stalled criminal justice reform.
U.S. Representatives Kelly Armstrong, Republican of North Dakota, and Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said the vacancies have ""forestalled the important work of updating and establishing new sentencing guidelines.""
A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment.
The commission lost its quorum in January 2019, a month after former Republican President Donald Trump signed into law the First Step Act, bipartisan legislation aimed at easing harsh sentencing for non-violent offenders and at reducing recidivism.
Armstrong and Raskin said the lack of quorum also meant the commission cannot update the advisory sentencing guidelines needed to help implement the law, resulting potentially in its uneven application by judges across the country.
""It is imperative that the vacancies are expeditiously filled so the Commission can continue its work to improve the federal criminal justice system,"" the lawmakers wrote.
The seven-person panel's lone remaining member, Senior U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, told Reuters this month he would be ""surprised and dismayed"" if Biden did not pick nominees by early 2022 and urged him to help restore its quorum.
Breyer's own term expired on Oct. 31 but he can remain on the commission for up to a year more unless a replacement is confirmed. Armstrong and Raskin cited his potential departure as another reason to act.
Breyer and others have said the lack of a quorum meant the commission could not advise judges on whether under the First Step Act inmates could secure compassionate release amid the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in inconsistent rulings.
The commission's seven members must include four federal judges, and no more than four members can be from the same party. Trump tapped five nominees in August 2020, but the Senate never acted on them.

764,"DUBAI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Oman and Qatar on Monday signed agreements on military cooperation, taxation, tourism, ports, labour and investment as Oman seeks to invigorate its debt-burdened economy, the state news agencies of both the Gulf states said.
Oman is among the weakest financially of the Gulf oil producers. It has been pursuing wide-ranging reforms and austerity measures since Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said took power almost two years ago following the death of his predecessor who ruled for half a century.
The agreements were signed during a two-day state visit by Oman's Sultan Haitham to the small but wealthy state of Qatar, one of the world's top producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
The deals included an agreement on double taxation and tax evasion on income and capital taxes, and an investment cooperation agreement between sovereign wealth funds the Qatar Investment Authority and the Oman Investment Authority, said Qatar's Amiri Diwan, the administrative office of the Emir.
Further details on the deals were not immediately available.
Since the oil price crash in 2014, Oman, a country of around 5 million people, has accumulated large amounts of debt. It recently embarked on a medium-term plan to fix its finances that were also hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oman last year was in talks with some Gulf countries for financial help, according to an October 2020 bond prospectus.",0

As part of the gift Bezos has asked that the plaza at the Obama Presidential Center be named the John Lewis Plaza, the foundation said in a statement.
""Freedom fighters deserve a special place in the pantheon of
heroes, and I can't think of a more fitting person to honor with this gift than John Lewis,"" Bezos said in the statement.

766,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - While Wall Street banks cheered the renomination of U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Monday, Democratic progressives were frustrated that the White House did not announce a tough new regulatory chief to crack down on banks on issues such as climate change and fair lending.  read more 
""President Biden’s renomination of Jerome Powell...is a major disappointment to those of us who have fought for tougher regulation of Wall Street as a key tool for protecting financial stability and building a more just and sustainable economy,"" progressive group Americans for Financial Reform said in a statement.
The Fed's current head of supervision Randal Quarles stepped down in October from that powerful role overseeing the country's largest lenders, and is due to leave the central bank next month. Biden said that and other Fed picks would be announced in early December.  read more 
Washington insiders had seen Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor and Treasury official under former President Barack Obama's administration, as the leading candidate to replace Quarles due to her vocal stance on the Fed's regulatory agenda.
But Brainard, who had opposed Quarles' efforts to ease rules introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, did not want the supervision post and was looking for a more senior role, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
Instead, she will step up to become Fed Vice Chair, the White House said.  read more 
A Fed spokesman for Brainard did not provide comment.
Progressive groups, eager for the Fed to reverse its Wall Street-friendly stance and accelerate efforts to tackle climate change and overhaul community lending rules, criticized the reappointment of Powell, a Republican appointee who had backed Quarles' changes, and called for a tough new regulation chief.
""This position must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement - and it needs to be done quickly,"" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement.
Whoever gets the supervision role faces a packed agenda, which will also include reviewing new capital rules and how banks are able to handle cryptocurrencies. read more 
“It’s problematic,” said Todd Phillips, director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. Following an announcement, it could take until February for the new supervision chief to be confirmed by the Senate, at which point the post would have been empty for around five months, he said.
“It's going to be a long time until that position is filled.”
Brainard voted against many of Quarles'changes, arguing they would increase systemic risk. Among the most contentious were revisions to the “Volcker Rule” curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and easing the Fed's annual “stress tests.""
Brainard acted as a moderating influence on the Fed's deregulatory agenda, Reuters has previously reported, winning applause from progressive Democrats.
The S&P 500 bank index rose 2.8% on news of Powell's reappointment, but progressives said they hoped to win a more left-leaning supervision pick. They have voiced frustration that the White House has been slow to fill key regulatory posts, and have said the administration is not moving quickly enough to address climate financial risks. read more 
Other names floated for the role according to Washington insiders include: Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor; Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic; acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu; U.S. Treasury under-secretary Nellie Liang; and law professor Mehrsa Baradaran.
Raymond James analyst Ed Mills said the supervision pick  will likely have ""very progressive views"" but that ""Powell’s leadership likely softens the impact.”",0
767,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo engaged in ""multiple instances of sexual harassment,"" used state resources for a book and was ""not fully transparent"" on the number of COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes, state lawmakers said on Monday, summarizing the results of an investigation.
""This has been a profoundly sad chapter in New York’s history,"" said state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who in March asked the Assembly's judiciary committee to investigate allegations against Cuomo.
In a statement on Monday a spokesman for Cuomo called the report ""revisionist"" and said Cuomo's team had not been given the opportunity to review evidence in the Assembly's possession.
Cuomo has denied wrongdoing in the past, though he said in August when he resigned that he accepted ""full responsibility"" for what he called clumsy attempts to be affectionate or humorous.
Heastie initially asked the judiciary committee to determine whether Cuomo should be removed from office, after two women who worked for Cuomo went public with complaints of sexual harassment.
The impeachment effort was mooted by Cuomo's resignation following the release of a report by New York Attorney General Letitia James that concluded Cuomo broke federal and state laws by sexually harassing women who worked for him.
Shortly after Cuomo resigned, his successor, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, revealed that 12,000 more people died of COVID-19 than was reported under Cuomo.
The state Assembly report released on Monday acknowledged ""ongoing law enforcement interests into several of the matters covered in this report,"" and said the report had been prepared ""with those interests in mind.""
The first prosecution to arise from the misconduct scandal that led to Cuomo's resignation was a criminal complaint charging him with the misdemeanor sex offense of forcible touching, which was filed in October in a court in Albany, the state capital.
Prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau County, Albany County, Westchester County and Oswego County have also requested evidence from the attorney general's investigation.",0
768,"WARSAW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Poland's economy is expected to grow by about 5% both in 2021 and 2022, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Monday, while pointing to the need to reduce fiscal support given the good economic situation.
There are still a lot of downside risks in terms of the pandemic, but Poland is in a very strong position despite inflationary pressures, OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann told reporters during a visit to the country.
""At this stage our expectations is that you will have about 5% growth in Poland in 2021, about 5% growth give or take in 2022 and for growth to start easing a little from 2023 onwards, but still remaining strong,"" he said.
In May the OECD said it expected the Polish economy to grow by 3.7% in 2021 and 4.7% in 2022.
""In terms of inflationary pressures, some parts of inflationary pressures we believe are going to be temporary, but there is some core inflationary pressure and there is some potential wage inflationary risks that will need to be monitored and responded to carefully,"" Cormann said.
Polish CPI reached 6.8% year on year in October, prompting the central bank to raise its main interest rate this month to 1.25% from 0.5%. 
Cormann said that given the strong performance of the Polish economy, the government should consider potentially reducing the current high level of fiscal support.
While a large part of pandemic support has been wound down, Poland has a low retirement age and relatively high benefits for parents compared with the minimum wage, potentially making a return to the workforce less attractive.
""The key is going to be among other things to find ways to boost productivity and workforce participation, because you're starting to have some skills shortages, labour shortages in some sectors,"" Cormann said.
""It's going to be important to mobilise all of the labour resources that are there in the economy and potentially even to supplement that and the level of fiscal support will need to be carefully adjusted to take into account the situation"".",0

770,"WAUKESHA, Wis., Nov 21 (Reuters) - Five people were killed and more than 40 injured when an SUV sped through a Christmas parade in the small town of Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, plowing into dozens of people including young children.
Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson told reporters that one person was in custody and a vehicle had been recovered after the incident in the town of around 72,000 people, 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee.
Police said the number of dead and injured could change.
Thompson said it was not clear whether the incident was terrorist in nature, but that there was no further danger and police had lifted an order urging people to shelter.
A video posted online showed a red sport utility vehicle driving at speed alongside and into the parade, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before crowds ran from sidewalks to offer assistance.
Thompson said an officer fired shots at the vehicle in an attempt to stop the carnage. Another video on social media appeared to show police firing on the vehicle as it crashed through street barriers. Police did not believe shots had been fired from the vehicle, Thompson added, contrary to earlier reports.
Nurse Jodi Singsime, 42, took shelter in a store with members of her family before going out to help the injured.
""I heard and saw the people being hit, but what you could do more than seeing is hearing, and just that sound was insane,"" she said.
She choked up as she described coming across a small boy in the road:
""I felt his neck for a pulse and he had one but his eyes were barely open and his face - all I can remember is his sweet little innocent face was purple. He wasn't really with us.""
Belen Santamaria, her husband, and their three-year old daughter were planning to join the parade with their Catholic church. But Santamaria, a 39-year-old Mexican factory worker, woke up on Sunday with a backache, so the family watched the procession from the sidewalk instead.
""The SUV came by at full speed,"" she said. ""Then I started to hear people screaming.""
She hid in a restaurant with their daughter while her husband, 39-year-old delivery worker Jesus Ochoa, ran to try to help injured people. He said he heard through other members of their church that roughly 10 members of the congregation, mostly Latinos and both adults and children, were injured.
""I was going to be there, walking,"" Santamaria said. ""The SUV would have hit us too.""
'DANCING GRANNIES'
Another woman told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that the SUV had hit a dance team of girls between 9 and 15 years old. Video on social media showed small groups surrounding injured girls with white pompoms scattered around.
One witness said the driver also hit a group of ""Dancing Grannies"" and at least one person flipped over the hood of the SUV, according to Milwaukee's WISN-TV, an ABC affiliate.
""Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers,"" the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said on their Facebook page.
Another witness estimated the SUV was going about 40 mph (64 kph) when it hit the parade, the TV station said.
""As we were walking back in between the buildings ... we saw an SUV cross over, just put the pedal to the metal and just zooming full speed along the parade route. And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,"" Angelito Tenorio, an alderman in nearby West Allis, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The local CBS affiliate later showed a picture on Twitter of what appeared to be the red SUV involved with its hood crumpled and front fender hanging off, parked in a driveway.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the ""tragic situation"" and federal officials were in contact with local authorities to offer assistance.
""Our hearts are with the families and the entire community,"" she said in a post on Twitter on Monday.
Photos and videos of Waukesha circulating on Twitter showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street decked out with Christmas lights in the aftermath of the incident, which occurred shortly after 4:30 p.m. (2230 GMT). People bundled up against the cold huddled on sidewalks as dusk fell.
The Children's Wisconsin hospital said it had received 15 patients as of 8 p.m., with no reported fatalities at that time.
Schools will remain closed on Monday for grades 4K-12 and additional counselors will be available for students, the district superintendent of schools said.
In 2015, four people were killed and 46 injured in Stillwater, Oklahoma, when a woman drove into a crowd watching the homecoming parade for a football team.",0

772,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Britain's pop music honours, the BRITs, will get rid of its female and male categories from next year, introducing gender-neutral awards for local and international artists, organisers said on Monday.
Performers will now be in the running for artist of the year or international artist of the year at the annual ceremony, which will next take place on Feb. 8, 2022.
""It is important that The BRITs continue to evolve and aim to be as inclusive as possible,"" new BRITs chair and Polydor Records Co-President Tom March said in a statement.
""It feels completely the right time to celebrate the achievements of artists for the music that they create, and the work that they do, irrespective of gender.""
The BRITs follow in the footsteps of other awards shows or events that have removed gender classifications.
In September, the San Sebastian Film Festival handed out its first ever gender-neutral acting award, for best leading performance, to joint winners Jessica Chastain and Flora Ofelia Hofmann Lindahl.  read more 
Next year's BRITs, the 42nd edition of the awards show, will also extend nominations to featured artists in the coveted song of the year category. Until now, only lead artists or named collaborators were recognised as nominees for the prize.
Four new genre awards will also be introduced to showcase a range of music styles: alternative/rock act, hip-hop/grime/rap act, dance act and pop/R'n'B act. All four will be voted for by the public.
British comedian Mo Gilligan will host the show, while artistic team Block9 will help with the design.
""The BRIT Awards are not just a celebration of British music, they are a reflection of British culture,"" said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry and BRIT Awards.
""The changes we are making for the 2022 show should mean more new fans, more engagement and a bigger global platform than ever for our amazing artists.""",0
773,"LONDON/OSLO Nov 22 (Reuters) - Consumers in the European Union and Britain face further gas price spikes this winter as flows of Russian gas via major transit routes are proving too little, too late.
The new Nord Stream 2 pipeline running from Russia to Europe might have eased a tight market. But it has faced more delays as German certification has been suspended, amid opposition to the whole project from the United States and some Europeans.
This year's power price shock has pushed several European and British energy suppliers out of business, as they cannot always pass on price rises to customers. Britain's Bulb, with 6% domestic market share, was the latest to go bust.  read more 
Sky-high electricity costs have forced some power-hungry industries to curtail production and European consumers are now paying more for home heating as winter approaches, adding to wider inflationary pressures.
Benchmark European gas prices this year surged as much as 700% by October and British prices climbed 500% or so as global economies recovered from the pandemic and sucked in gas, particularly Asia nations, while European stocks are low.
European gas  was up more than 300% this year on Monday and the British benchmark  was up about 250%.
Prices eased when President Vladimir Putin said in October Russia would boost gas supplies to record levels, raising hopes that bumper flows would ward off supply shortages. 
But flows through major pipelines, such as Yamal which runs to Germany via Belarus and Poland, have not ramped up as much as hoped and there has been no sign of extra capacity booked at auction on other routes, including those via Ukraine. 
""I wouldn't rule out a return to the record highs of October if you look at how short the market is and limited Russian flows,"" Refinitiv analyst Wayne Bryan said.
State-owned Gazprom (GAZP.MM), which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, says it is meeting all its long-term contracts. European companies contacted by Reuters confirmed contractual obligations had been met.
But supplies to the spot market, which many domestic gas providers rely on for their supplies, remain low.
Refinitiv Eikon data shows daily flows were barely changed in September, October and so far in November from a year ago via the three main routes from Russia to Europe, namely the Yamal route, Nord Stream 1 which runs directly to Germany, and the pipeline network crossing Ukraine.

Volumes are slightly higher than the average for November 2020, when economic shutdowns due to the pandemic limited demand, and are 40% lower than the average for November 2019.
Renewables, such as wind and solar which account for a growing portion of European power supplies, are not guaranteed to be able to fill the gap in supplies of electricity in order to ease demand on gas-fired generation.
""If flows don't pick up and there is a cold snap, or low wind speeds, we could see crazy prices again. We are living hand to mouth,"" a gas trader said.
The suspension of the certification for Nord Stream 2 adds to market jitters as demand rises during Europe's main heating season, running from Oct. 1 until the end of March.  read more 
Once German certification is secured, the European Commission still has to sign off on the project. It will have two more months to do this.
That could mean the project is unlikely to start commercial gas flows before the third quarter, said Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski.
""It raises issues about peak supply, meaning we could see very high prices and disruptions of gas supply to industry, particularly if there are a number of cold spells making the winter colder than normal,"" he said.
Europe gas stocks remain well below average. Storage sites in northwest Europe controlled by Gazprom held about 41 terrawatt hours (TWh) on Nov. 17, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The average figure was 113 TWh for the same day in 2017-2020.  read more 
""Since Nov. 9 injections at Gazprom-controlled storage within Europe have averaged only 5 million cubic metres/day, which is quite insignificant,"" said James Huckstepp, manager  EMEA gas analytics at S&P Global Platts.
Asian countries have sucked in supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG), driving up prices for LNG shipments and adding to Europe's challenge in rebuilding stocks.  read more 
""The JKM (Japan-Korea-Marker Asian benchmark) has continued to price at sufficient premiums to maintain LNG flows into that area at the expense of Europe,"" Sikorski said
""A colder than normal winter – likely given La Nina weather patterns – will likely mean that little incremental LNG will be available,"" he said.",0
774,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency startup MoonPay has raised fresh capital from investors led by Tiger Global Management and hedge fund Coatue at a valuation of $3.4 billion, becoming the latest venture to capitalize on sky-high investor demand for rapidly growing companies in the sector.
The company said on Monday it had raised $555 million in a Series A funding round that also saw participation from Blossom Capital, Thrive Capital, Paradigm and NEA.
MoonPay's valuation comes as bitcoin, the largest and most popular cryptocurrency, is trading close to $60,000 per unit even though digital asset classes like it have come under global regulatory scrutiny for their potential use in money laundering.
Several other companies in this space have also caught the fancy of investors this year. Crypto startup Gemini, led by internet entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, fetched a valuation of $7.1 billion last week. FTX Trading, a platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, was valued at $25 billion after a funding round last month.
MoonPay, which is profitable, says it helps businesses transact digital assets quickly and smoothly. It also claims it had helped Bitcoin.com, a blockchain technology company, boost its revenue more than six-fold.
The company said its technology for non-fungible tokens, unique crypto tokens that cannot be replicated, has also been used by NFT marketplace OpenSea.",0
775,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's pick of Jerome Powell to continue as Federal Reserve chair reassured investors who said it gave some predictability as the central bank prepares to start hiking rates and slows the pace of bond buying.
Many investors had hoped that Powell, who was nominated as chair by President Donald Trump in 2017, would be renominated by Biden for another four-year stint. On Monday, Biden nominated Powell for a second four-year term, with Lael Brainard, the Federal Reserve board member who was the other top candidate for the job, as vice chair.
Biden also has three Fed seats to fill, including the vice chair for supervision, and intends to pick those in early December.  read more 
Powell's current term, which is due to run out in February 2022, has proven positive for risk assets, with the S&P gaining 69.7% since his appointment on Feb. 5, 2018, and hitting a series of new records in part helped by emergency measures the Fed launched in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
“My reaction is one of relief,"" said Peter Tuz, president, Chase Investment Counsel, Charlottesville, Virginia. ""He was a steady hand, I think people liked in general the policies that he enacted since (COVID-19) first became an issue.""
While Tuz said that Powell was ""liked by both parties, he has been a pretty stable force.”
Powell had always been the favorite, but he was seen as less of a slam-dunk after his odds in betting markets fell following sharp criticism of his performance by progressive Democrats and a trading scandal among Federal Reserve officials. L1N2R020J
Online betting website PredictIt gave Powell a 79% chance of being confirmed by the U.S. Senate as of Monday morning, down from a 90% chance on Sept. 12, while the odds that Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard would be nominated had increased to 23% from a low of 6% in September.
While the leadership of the U.S. central bank is always important to markets, Biden's decision takes on heightened significance this year as the Federal Reserve starts tapering its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.
At the same time, the Fed is confronting an historic surge of inflation as global supply chains remain disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed earlier in November released its asset purchase schedule as it begins to slow purchases. 
""The markets are going to take this as a sign of relief,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management.
Pavlik said that Brainard taking the vice chair role ""at least puts some kind of pressure on Powell to not to move too quickly with raising rates.""
Brainard, who was nominated to the Fed board by former President Barack Obama in 2014, is widely seen as more dovish than Powell in part because of her push to retain super-easy monetary policy until there is more progress on job recovery.
Ahead of the announcement, markets had priced in some risk of Brainard being elevated, and the news of Powell caused fixed income markets to price in ""a bit more Fed tightening"" while bank stocks gained, ""with Brainard being viewed as more dovish on monetary policy,"" wrote analysts at TD Securities.
U.S. government bond yields, which move inversely to prices, rose on the news, with those on two- and five-year Treasuries hitting their highest levels since early 2020.  The dollar extended gains against a basket of currencies and the S&P 500 gained but then reversed by the end of the day.
Futures on the federal funds rate, which track short-term interest rate expectations , have fully priced in a quarter-point tightening by next June, up from more than 90% before Biden's announcement.
Analysts at NatWest said that while in a high inflation environment the difference between Powell and Brainard would be ""basically nil"", they said ""it is possible one can argue a taper acceleration"" is more likely in December under Powell.",0
776,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Militiamen killed about 20 people during an attack on displaced civilians in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the government said on Monday.
Fighters from the CODECO militia raided the village of Drodro on Sunday night, Jules Ngongo, a spokesperson for Ituri's military government, told Reuters.
He said they killed 12 civilians, six of them children. Patrick Muyaya, the spokesperson for the national government, later said on Twitter that the death toll stood at around 20.
Repeated attacks by CODECO have killed hundreds of civilians in Ituri province's Djugu territory since 2017 and forced thousands to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.
CODECO's fighters are drawn mainly from the Lendu farming community, which has long been in conflict with Hema herders.
""Their objective was to attack the population that was displaced in Drodro,"" Ngongo said.
Others said the death toll was higher.
Ngabu Lidja Chrysante, a priest and coordinator for the Catholic charity Caritas in Ituri, said his colleagues on the ground had seen the bodies of 35 people killed in the attack, which also targeted the local church.
Kivu Security Tracker, which maps violence in Congo, said it had confirmed 29 deaths. It had earlier reported 107 deaths but said that information turned out to be erroneous.
Mathias Gilman, the spokesperson for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo, said at least 16,000 people fleeing the attacks had taken shelter at a nearby site protected by peacekeepers.
CODECO spokesperson Patrick Basa denied the group had killed civilians. He told Reuters its fighters had clashed in Drodro with a Hema militia but said the civilians had already fled the area.
Conflict between Lendu and Hema from 1999 to 2007 resulted in an estimated 50,000 deaths in one of the bloodiest chapters of a civil war in eastern Congo.
Ituri and neighbouring North Kivu province have been run by military officers since May when the government declared a state of siege in response to rampant violence, but the killings have not shown any sign of abating since then.",0
777,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Formula One race director Michael Masi personally referred Red Bull team boss Christian Horner to Qatar Grand Prix stewards for television comments about a 'rogue marshal', the Australian said after Sunday's race.
Horner apologised, was given an official warning and agreed to take part in an international stewards' programme next February. 
""It was a race director referral to the stewards,"" Masi told reporters. ""I don't have time to go and search social media in the lead up to a race but I was advised of them (the comments) and referred Christian.
""Christian was very apologetic for his comments and as part of that obviously the stewards' decision was straightforward.""
Masi said nobody should be criticised for acting in the interests of safety and pointed out that marshals were unpaid volunteers and the sport relied upon them.
""All of them give up a huge amount of time, and without them it won't happen,"" he said.
""That's the part that a lot of people miss, and I'll defend every volunteer official and every official around every racetrack around the world that that (criticism) is not accepted.""
Local marshals decide on flag issues while safety car and red flags are called by race control.
Horner said he had spoken out in frustration more at a situation than any individual after his championship leader Max Verstappen was handed a five-place grid penalty ahead of Sunday's race.
The Dutch driver was punished after not slowing for waved yellow flags at the end of Saturday's qualifying when Pierre Gasly's AlphaTauri had stopped on track with a puncture and broken wing.
Verstappen finished second in the floodlit night race, won by Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton, with his overall lead trimmed to eight points, with two races remaining in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.",0

779,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly rose in October, reaching their highest level in nine months, though higher prices amid tight supply continued to sideline first-time buyers from the market.
The report from the National Association of Realtors on Monday also showed an increase in the share of investors buying homes last month, likely reflecting growing demand for rental accommodation as the economy reverts to normal, thanks to vaccinations against COVID-19.
""Home sales remain resilient given the extremely tight supply of homes for sale,"" said Shannon Brobst, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Potential home buyers will continue to find it challenging to find a home that meets their budget.""
Existing home sales rose 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.34 million units last month. The second straight monthly increase lifted sales to their highest level since January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling to a rate of 6.20 million units.
Sales rose in the most affordable Midwest region and the densely populated South, but fell in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West, which is the most expensive region.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, dropped 5.8% on a year-on-year basis. The annual decline was, however, distorted by the surge in sales in October 2020.
Last month's sales pace was well above the 5.64 million units sold in 2020 and 5.34 million units in 2019.
First-time buyers accounted for 29% of sales, up from 28% in September and down from 32% a year ago. Individual investors or second-home buyers made up 17% of transactions. That compared to 13% in September and 14% a year ago.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting record highs after President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lead the U.S. central bank for a second term. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
EXPENSIVE HOMES
Sales soared over the summer of last year amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling during the pandemic.
With vaccinations allowing workers to return to offices and schools to reopen for in-person learning, the pandemic tailwind has subsided. Sales have declined from a peak 6.73 million unit-pace in October 2020, but demand for housing remains strong and continues to run against modest supply.
The median existing house price increased 13.1% from a year earlier to $353,900 in October. Sales were concentrated in the $250,000-$500,000 price range.
""While competition for homes has eased somewhat since the mania months earlier this year, competition is still fierce and prices are still rising at double-digit rates,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The problem is especially acute for lower-income buyers given prices and home availability are still skewed toward higher-priced homes.""
There were 1.25 million previously owned homes on the market in October, down 12% from a year ago. Last month, properties typically stayed on the market for 18 days. That compared to 17 days in September and 21 days a year ago. Eighty-two percent of homes sold in October were on the market for less than a month.
Government data last week showed a sharp decline in single-family homebuilding in October and the largest backlog of houses yet to be constructed in 15 years because of shortages of materials and labor. That could boost housing inventory when the supply constraints ease.  read more 
At October's sales pace, it would take 2.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.5 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.",0
780,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - “Plenitude” sounds a bit like what might happen if you combined Eni (ENI.MI) with platitudes. As with most corporate rebrands, the $50 billion Italian oil group’s new name for its green arm, which means “abundance”, is indeed slightly trite. But the wider initial public offering may influence investor attitudes to how oil companies decarbonise.
In aiming to sell 30% of a portfolio that includes 10 million retail customers and over six gigawatts of renewable energy power by 2025, Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi is taking a different route to the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L),  and SSE (SSE.L). They think legacy fossil fuel assets should fund decarbonisation. Shell and SSE activists Dan Loeb and Elliott Management reckon separated green businesses could trade at higher multiples  read more .
By retaining a majority stake in the green business Descalzi will be somewhere in between. Either way, Breakingviews’ 9 billion euro valuation of Plenitude assumes a multiple of 10 times likely 2024 EBITDA , a discount to wind energy behemoth Orsted (ORSTED.CO). If the unit’s listing next year shows investors are inclined to be more generous, Eni’s rivals may themselves plan renewable energy IPOs. (By George Hay)

781,"NEW YORK, Nov 22  (Reuters) - The dollar set a 16-month high against the euro on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was nominated for a second four-year term by President Joe Biden, while the single currency was also hurt by an increase in COVID-19 cases in the region.
Lael Brainard, the Federal Reserve board member who was the other top candidate for the job, will be vice chair, the White House said.  read more 
""With Powell being renominated for a second term, that suggests a less dovish outlook for monetary policy than under a potential Brainard leadership,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analysts at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
""It looks like there’s greater scope for U.S. rate hikes under Powell with Powell remaining on as the Fed Chair, and that has been broadly positive for the dollar.”
The dollar index against a basket of currencies  rose 0.27% on the day to 96.29, the highest since July 2020. The euro  dipped 0.46% to $1.1248, also the weakest since July 2020.
The single currency was dragged lower earlier on Monday as concerns grew over new COVID-19 restrictions in Europe, with Austria entering another full lockdown and Germany considering following suit.  read more 
“It’s kind of been a one-two-punch for the euro. One has been a rise in cases across the bloc, and what that is doing is reinforcing the decidedly dovish outlook for (European Central Bank) policy and that stands in stark contrast to the Fed, where pressure is building for the U.S. central bank to adopt a quicker pace of normalization,” Manimbo said.
The Fed will release minutes from its Nov. 2-3 meeting on Wednesday, which will be evaluated for any new indications that Fed officials are becoming more concerned about stubbornly high inflation.
Fed officials Richard Clarida and Christopher Waller on Friday suggested a faster pace of stimulus tapering may be appropriate amid a quickening recovery and heated inflation.  read more

782,"COPENHAGEN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Greenland said on Monday it has stripped a Chinese mining company of its licence to an iron ore deposit near the capital Nuuk, dealing a blow to attempts by Chinese companies to gain a foothold on the resource-rich Arctic island.
General Nice, a Chinese coal and iron ore importer, took control of the Isua mine project in 2015, replacing previous owner London Mining, which went bankrupt.
It was the first Chinese firm to have the right to exploit minerals in Greenland, which has attracted international interest as climate change has opened up waterways and access to the vast Arctic island's mineral resources.
The licence was withdrawn because of inactivity at the site, the government said in a statement, adding it will be offered to new interested companies once it has formally been handed back.
The company also failed to make the agreed guarantee payments, it said.
""We cannot accept that a licence-holder repeatedly fails to meet agreed deadlines,"" Greenland's Resources Minister Naaja Nathanielsen said.
The government requested that all geological data is returned, remaining payments of 1.5 million Danish crowns are deposited, and the mining area is cleaned up.
London Mining, which obtained the exploitation licence in 2013, had initially planned to hire some 2,000 Chinese workers to construct the project and aimed to supply China with around 15 million metric tonnes of iron ore a year.
However, it failed to secure sufficient financing.
Greenland's government, elected in April, has said it supports environmentally responsible mining.
This year it banned uranium mining, effectively halting development of the Kuannersuit mine, one of the world's biggest rare earth deposits, which is partly-owned by a Chinese company.
General Nice also attempted in 2016 to buy an abandoned naval station in Greenland from Denmark, but Copenhagen vetoed the offer because of security concerns, sources told Reuters at the time.
General Nice could not be reached for comment.
In 2018, Greenland rejected an offer from a Chinese state bank and a state-owned construction company to finance and build two airports in Greenland.",0

784,"TAIPEI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Taiwan firms operating in China need to draw a line between themselves and independence supporters, China's government said on Monday after punishing a major Taiwanese firm ostensibly for business violations.
China, which claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, has heaped pressure on the island to accept Beijing's rule. It said earlier this month it would hold those who support the island's formal independence, including companies, criminally liable.
China's official Xinhua news agency said early on Monday that law enforcement agencies across China had punished Taiwan's Far Eastern Group, which has interests ranging from hotels to petrochemicals, for a series of problems, from tax to fire safety, and that the investigation was continuing.
In a statement late on  Monday answering a question on whether the move was linked to the government's targeting of ""stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence"" forces, China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not draw a direct link, repeating Xinhua's accusations against the company.
But it added in a separate sentence that those who support Taiwan independence threatened peace and stability and harmed the interests of the Chinese people.
""They and their connected companies and financiers must be punished in accordance with the law,"" it said.
China welcomes Taiwanese companies, but does not allow those who support Taiwan independence to earn money in China, the office added.
""The majority of Taiwanese businessmen and enterprises must distinguish right from wrong, stand firm, draw a clear line with the Taiwan independence separatist forces, and take practical actions to maintain the peaceful development of cross-strait relations,"" it said.
While the Far Eastern Group has not responded to requests for comment, one of its listed units, Far Eastern New Century Corp (1402.TW), said its textile operations in China had been inspected by law enforcement in the second quarter, who did find problems over tax, fire safety and environmental protection.
It added it had made almost all the changes that had been required, having been fined 36.5 million yuan ($5.72 million).

786,"JERUSALEM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared in court on Monday to face a key prosecution witness in his corruption trial.
Netanyahu, who served as prime minister for 12 years until June, has pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud in cases that centre on alleged regulatory favours he awarded to media tycoons in return for positive press coverage and receipt of gifts, including cigars and champagne.
Netanyahu, now opposition leader, smiled under his black face mask as he walked into the Jerusalem District courtroom to hear the testimony of his former spokesman and close adviser Nir Hefetz, one of a small group of ex-aides to turn state's witness against the country's first premier to be criminally charged while still in office.
""Netanyahu spends at least as much as his time on media as he spends on security matters, including on matters an outsider would consider nonsense,"" Hefetz told the court.
Netanyahu, 72, is not required to attend the trial hearings and he has made few court appearances. He made no comment to reporters as slogans shouted outside in the street by a cluster of his supporters wafted into the courtroom who faced off with a small group of anti-Netanyahu protesters.
Netanyahu's trial has been a polarising issue for Israelis. His loyal supporters bemoan it as a left-wing witch-hunt that targeted a popular right-wing leader, while his staunch critics hail it as the triumph of law over grave government corruption that had plunged Israel into two years of political turmoil.

787,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday he proposed a plan last week to boost investment in North America to reduce reliance on foreign imports in his talks with U.S. President Joe Biden and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
During the summit in Washington, Lopez Obrador said if North America did not move to strengthen its economy, the region risked being left behind by China, and suggested Canada and the United States should make more use of migrant labor.
""I made a proposal to promote a program of productive investments in North America for the substitution of imports,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters at a news conference, citing a shortage of semi-conductors as an example.
Lopez Obrador said he had also explored with Trudeau possible cooperation between Canadian and Mexican public sector energy companies in upgrading hydro-electric plants in Mexico.
He said pending mining issues with Canadian firms had gradually been resolved, and that he had explained to Trudeau why Mexico was seeking to bolster state control over the electricity market, a plan that has sparked U.S. concerns.
Noting Trudeau had been ""very receptive"" to his words, Lopez Obrador repeated his argument that private investors in renewable energy had ""plundered"" Mexico, and that concessions for oil production had been abused for ""financial speculation.""
With Biden, Lopez Obrador said he had discussed economic support for Central America aimed at curbing mass migration, and that investment was being planned for Honduras under a scheme known as 'sembrando oportunidades' ('planting opportunities') he added, likening it to a Mexican reforestation scheme.
""U.S. Vice President (Kamala) Harris also confirmed it,"" said Lopez Obrador, who also met her in Washington.

789,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Lael Brainard, who has been nominated as vice chair of the Federal Reserve, has been a mainstay in Democratic policy circles since joining the administration of former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, including stints running a global economics program at the Brookings Institution and as former President Barack Obama's top Treasury liaison for international affairs.
But it is as a Federal Reserve governor the last seven years that she has come into her own as a policymaker, with broad influence over central bank affairs from monetary policy to financial regulation, climate change and the Fed's relationship with less well-off communities.
Brainard, 59, is now going to expand that influence with her appointment as vice chair, the No. 2 role at the Fed, although it means she has been passed over for promotion to the top slot, in a sign President Joe Biden valued continuity in reappointing Jerome Powell, a Republican, over the desires of his progressive wing.
If she is confirmed and serves at least the full four-year term, she'd have the longest unbroken stint on the Fed board since Alan Greenspan's nearly 18.5 years as Fed chair.
That longevity has already left an imprint.
Appointed to the Fed in 2014, she brought not only a Harvard economics PhD to the job but a deep set of global contacts as well. Yet she at first held her counsel, waiting a full year before giving a speech on monetary policy.
When she did it marked a turning point in what was then an intense Fed debate over when to raise interest rates for the first time since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis and recession. The Fed seemed poised to act, but Brainard's inaugural policy speech in June 2015 crystallized the case for waiting as global economic data weakened and, she argued, posed risks for the United States as well.
That first rate hike didn't happen until the Fed's December  2015 meeting. While Brainard went along with it, transcripts of that session show her making arguments that would eventually gain broad acceptance as the central bank reconciled it was living in a low interest rate world that likely needed a new approach.
She pushed for that as the Fed steered toward a new framework that put more emphasis on jobs, at one point acknowledging that some of the rate increases she voted for under then Chair Janet Yellen were probably ill-advised.
She has not always won. In recent years, with Republican-appointee Randal Quarles as vice chair for financial regulation, she dissented 23 times on regulatory and supervisory issues she felt would make the financial system less safe or less resilient to outside shocks.
But her persistence through those years has paid off. Appointed to a full 14-year term that extends to 2028 - Fed governors often only serve partial terms because they fill spots made open by resignations - she was the rare Obama appointee who outlasted President Donald Trump, and now takes on an even more prominent role under Biden.",0

791,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jerome Powell’s renomination as chair of the Federal Reserve sets him up for a thankless task  read more . If he moves quickly on raising rates, as traditional inflation measures suggest he ought to, he could cut off job creation, going against his word. If he moves too slowly, prices could keep going up. The only consolation is that given this unenviable job, Powell is still the safest bet .
The Fed’s biggest conundrum is what to do about inflation, a long-absent central-bank foe that has revived thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic . The consumer price index rose 6.2% in October year-over-year, the biggest jump since 1990. Supply-chain bottlenecks due to Covid-19 coupled with a jump in demand for goods have created economic imbalances.
Powell has said he would be patient on rate hikes, and the nomination of dovish Lael Brainard as his vice chair suggests the Fed will stick to that path. Both want to give the labor market more time to heal so that women and minorities benefit  read more . The unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in October but the labor participation rate for Black workers and job seekers fell from September by 0.2 percentage points to 61.1%.
These groups, though, are at the sharp end of whatever course the Fed takes. If near-zero rates cause consumer prices to jump higher, more vulnerable populations will be hit hardest. Inequality is also likely to rise as asset prices do. Yet if employers respond to higher rates by slowing the pace of hiring, many non-working Americans won’t get the chance to enter the labor market.
To make things worse, the pandemic has also spurred unusual economic behavior. Additional unemployment benefits expired in September. Yet that same month, a record 4.4 million people quit their jobs. Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest level since 2011 in November, but retail sales surged more than 16% in October year-over-year.
In such uncharted territory, Powell is at least the best person for the job, assuming the Senate is prepared to confirm him. He has already steered the Fed’s aggressive response to the pandemic and is honest about the fallibility of central bank assumptions. The rise in the S&P 500 Index on Monday reflects that Powell is at least a known quantity, in an economy where known quantities are hard to come by.

793,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on Monday after President Joe Biden announced he would nominate Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term while elevating Fed Governor Lael Brainard to vice chair.
Powell, who was widely expected to be tapped for a second term, will helm the U.S. central bank as it begins to pull back its emergency-level support of the economy and tame inflation, which recently hit its highest levels since 1990.
The two-year  U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 8.5 basis points at 0.590%, its highest since early March 2020 - before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared - following a weak auction of $58 billion in notes, said Lou Brien, an analyst at DRW Trading.
The Treasury also auctioned $59 billion in five-year notes in a sale that Brien characterized as ""less than good,"" with primary dealers taking the largest percentage of the sale since February. Five-year Treasury yields rose to 1.32%, their highest level since February 2020.
The rising of short-term yields suggests that the market is anticipating a more aggressive tapering move by the Fed in 2022, said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. Rates Strategy at BMO Capital Markets.
Powell's nomination ""certainly puts an earlier lift-off on the table,"" Lyngen added.
Futures on the federal funds rate , which track short-term interest rate expectations, on Monday priced in a 100% chance of a quarter-point tightening by the Federal Reserve by June next year. The probability was at more than 90% before Biden's announcement.
Powell's nomination ""provides a little bit more legitimacy to market pricing in terms of Fed tightening next year,"" said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes  was up 8.9 basis points to 1.625%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond  was up 6.6 basis points to 1.973%.
The yield curve flattened, with spreads between 5- and 30-year Treasuries tightening to their lowest levels since March 2020, while the spread between 5- and 10-year Treasuries reached to their lowest since July 2020.

794,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who presided over a historic run-up in stocks during his tenure, will likely begin his second term amid worries over how rising inflation and looming monetary policy tightening will affect asset prices.
Powell replaced Janet Yellen as Fed Chair in February 2018 and has had to steer the economy through its worst crisis since World War Two, as the COVID-19 pandemic battered U.S. growth last year.
The S&P 500 has risen around 70% under Powell, fueled in-part by extraordinary measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic. The index increased by 59% under Yellen's four-year tenure and rose 39% during Ben Bernanke's eight-year term through January 2014.
Among investors' most immediate concerns are whether a recent inflationary surge will prove more sustained than the Fed had expected, pushing the central bank to accelerate the unwinding of its $120 billion-per-month bond buying program and raise rates earlier than anticipated.
The Fed's policymakers are publicly debating whether to withdraw support for the U.S. economy more quickly to deal with inflation, with one official signaling on Friday that the idea will be discussed at the central bank's upcoming meeting.  read more 
Inflation expectations in the U.S. bond market have climbed in recent weeks, bolstering the view that the Fed may need to act more aggressively.
The difference between yields on 5-year and 10-year Treasury inflation protected securities and those on typical Treasuries stand near record highs.
The pace at which the Fed unwinds its roughly $8.6 trillion balance sheet and moves on to a series of expected interest rate hikes can also be a key driver of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. currency rose by around 20% between mid-2014 and early 2015, when it became evident that the Fed would be far more aggressive than other central banks in normalizing monetary policy.
The greenback is up around 7% under Powell, and its gains have accelerated in recent weeks as some investors bet U.S. monetary policy will take a more hawkish course.  read more 
With inflation rising at its fastest pace in decades, investors increasingly believe the Fed will need to raise rates faster than suggested in its so-called dot plot, released in September. The Fed's next meeting is December 14-15.
One key metric the Fed is watching as it fine tunes its monetary policy is unemployment. Powell said on Nov. 3 that the economy is not yet at maximum employment, meaning it is not yet time to raise interest rates.
But he added that the labor market could reach full employment by the second half of 2022 if it continues to improve at the same pace seen over the last year.",0
795,"BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Chinese outbound tourism numbers are set to jump by more than 25% this year from 2020 but remain ""basically at a standstill"" compared to pre-pandemic levels, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday, citing official projections.
The dramatic drop in travellers from China, the world's most populous nation, since the rapid spread of coronavirus early last year, has left a $255 billion annual spending hole in the global tourism market.
A total of 25.62 million Chinese tourist trips overseas are expected to be made in 2021, CCTV said, citing an annual report on outbound tourism from the China Tourism Academy, part of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
That is up from 20.334 million in 2020, which was itself an 86.9% plunge from a year earlier as the coronavirus outbreak led to severe restrictions on global travel.
This year's projection, which includes trips to special administrative regions of China such as the gambling hub of Macau, will still be well below annual numbers of over 100 million before the pandemic hit, CCTV noted.
Macau, a former Portuguese colony, has become a ""bright spot"" for outbound tourism from mainland China due to effective virus prevention and control measures, CCTV said.
The pace of recovery in 2022 will depend on how other destinations handle tourism, it added.

Ofgem said any funds that current and former domestic customers of the suppliers had paid into their accounts would be protected, where they are in credit. Domestic customers will also be protected by the energy price cap with their new supplier.

Peng, a former doubles world number one, had a video call on Sunday with IOC president Thomas Bach and told him she was safe and well after Western governments and the global tennis community expressed mounting concern for her wellbeing.
The 35-year-old had not been seen for nearly three weeks since alleging on social media that former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.
Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on Peng's allegations.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to an email request on Monday for comment on the Amnesty statement.
""The IOC is entering dangerous waters. They should be extremely careful not to participate in any whitewash of possible human rights violations,"" said Amnesty's China researcher Alkan Akad.
""In the past we have seen various similar cases where people had no option but to say what they had been told to,"" he said.
Akad said the video call was barely convincing and did little to alleviate fears over the player's wellbeing, echoing the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) earlier on Monday.
""The Chinese government has a track record, especially the state run media outlets of fabricating statements or making people give forced and sometimes televised testimonies shortly after people go missing,"" said Akad.

COMMENTS:
JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER OF TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY
“It is stability which is good. The market doesn't like changes and volatility. However, some people think that Powell has let inflation get out of control and hasn't really made a move for fear of political or other reasons. Now that could be a bad thing because that person who's now in-charge is going to continue to potentially go too slow. And that’s the main thing, no one really knows if he is going too fast or too slow or if the inflation is really transitory.”
MICHAEL BROWN, SENIOR ANALYST, CAXTON, LONDON
""Knee-jerk rally in the dollar looks to be driven more by a position unwind of those short expecting Brainard than anything else. Maintaining the status quo of Powell shouldn’t change the outlook materially.""
PETER TUZ, PRESIDENT, CHASE INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA
“My reaction is one of relief. He was a steady hand, I think people liked in general the policies that he enacted since Covid first became an issue. Some valid criticism on whether he has been as forthright on inflation and the need for corrective action to keep it from getting out of control. That is kind of valid criticism. But all in all he is liked by both parties, he has been a pretty stable force.”
“I thought the world could adjust to Lael Brainard ok. This is in the market that she might be nominated. So I thought that wouldn’t have been a big negative.""
JUAN PEREZ, FX TRADER AND STRATEGIST, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON
""At the moment, it seems the buck is welcoming news of Powell's continuation, and we believe it is fair since he has steered the ship that is monetary policy relatively well throughout unprecedented times. Naturally, Lael Brainard, the more dovish potential candidate,  not getting the nod is a break for those who strongly believed she would match the dovishness of ECB's Christine Lagarde. We think this combo of China stimulus, Japan stimulus, and hesitation from central banks on the other side of the Atlantic plays well for the buck and only impressive indicators can change that tune.""
MAZEN ISSA, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“What I think it does do is that because there was a non-trivial chance - that betting markets had Brainard at about 30% taking the Fed chair - it does leave a bit of a hawkish feel from a markets’ perspective, just as the market needs to price out some of that expectation that Brainard had a chance of getting nominated.”
“It’s a little bit more supportive for the dollar on the margins. Certainly now, Powell does not need to pay lip service to the prevailing narrative at the Fed in terms of inflation and all of that, so I suspect that, especially as the mid-terms come around and the renomination process comes up, I’m sure you’re probably see a lot more context about inflation and I think he can be a little bit more transparent in that regard.”
“It also helps solidify the notion that you may have a little bit more of a pragmatic Fed. Whereas Brainard is viewed as an unambiguous dove, having her as a vice-chair I think creates some balance in terms of top line messaging, but there are still a number of vacancies on the Federal Reserve committee and there is a good chance that you may see some dovish names that get put in place.”
BRAD McMILLAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER,  COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL NETWORK, WALTHAM, MA
“It’s a vote for continuity, it’s a vote for confidence and the path the Fed has been on. It’s a nod to the fact that markets might not have been as happy about Brainard. Markets are interpreting it correctly as the Biden administration saying we are not going to go down towards the (modern monetary theory) path, we are going to stay the steady course. It is a vote to not change things as much as perhaps some of the legislation moving through Congress would suggest is being changed.”
RICK MECKLER, PARTNER AT CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS IN NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY
“It's certainly being viewed in a positive light by investors, who like to see continuity in policy because it makes it easier to make investment choices. From a banking stock perspective, there was a lot of fear that if he wasn't chosen, and she was chosen, there'd be much more scrutiny and problems for the banking sector.”
JOHN DOYLE, VICE PRESIDENT OF DEALING AND TRADING, TEMPUS INC., WASHINGTON
“The decision was mostly expected.  I think the knee jerk reaction is one of relief for markets because Powell is a known entity and we know what to expect from him.  I would not call him the hawkish pick but he is less dovish than Brainard. The dollar is gaining as interest rate hike expectations begin to firm for next year.”
JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CRESSET CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO
""The market will take it as welcome news, just because Chairman Powell was a known quantity. I think the doves were hoping for Lael Brainard, who I think is even more dovish than Powell. I can't say it was widely expected, but it was certainly one of the outcomes that was expected.""
""The oversight role is still a risk for the banks. And so that's something we're going to pay attention to.""
GREGORY DACO, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, NEW YORK
""It's probably the best of all outcomes. You maintain a dynamic duo at the helm of the Fed, you ensure continuity from a policy perspective, and you essentially have two of the most apt candidates both as Fed chair and Fed vice chair for the near future. I think it's a sound decision. It's one that will ensure that the Fed has the right type of personnel to guide us through the second part of this recovery phase, which will be a tricky one with high inflation and questions as to whether the Fed needs to tighten monetary policy or not.""
""I would expect confirmation in the Senate to be certainly straight forward given that Powell has strong bipartisan support. Even if he loses a couple of votes on the Democratic side, he should get through Senate confirmation.""
RANDY FREDERICK, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS
""Markets like predictability and so they are reacting positively. They don't like uncertainty and while Brainard may have been a fine choice, the markets would not know what to expect from her even though the general consensus was that it meant lower rates for longer, but we don't know that for certain.""
ROBERT PAVLIK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT DAKOTA WEALTH MANAGEMENT
""The markets are going to take this as a sign of relief.""
""You're going to see some strength in financials today, as that relief comes to fruition, and the fact that Brainard is going to be vice chair at least puts some kind of pressure on Powell to not to move too quickly with raising rates.""
""What I think the message is that we're on a course to reduce tapering and we're headed towards higher interest rates, which will most likely going to be raised in the middle of next year, and I think Wall Street has already digested most of that.""
""This is sort of a another confirmation that the Fed has a plan.""
DENNIS DICK, PROPRIETARY TRADER, BRIGHT TRADING LLC, LAS VEGAS
""The market likes certainty and we know what we get that with Powell. We know he is going to be accommodating. Obviously we've got an inflation issue and we know that with Powell that's not his primary concern. His primary concern has been to keep the economy going strong and that hopefully inflation would take care of itself.”
“Potentially with Powell coming back in there could be more inflation trade because that's not his priority.”
“The markets are flying this morning for the simple reason that they know what they get with Powell. I would go as far as to say Powell is one of the most accommodating Fed chair this market has ever seen.”
“But the question is what does that mean for inflation as it gets hotter and hotter? I'd be somewhat skeptical that it's all good news.""
JOE MANIMBO, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, WESTERN UNION BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, WASHINGTON
“We’re seeing a knee-jerk move higher for the dollar now that we’ve finally got clarity on the Fed post. With Powell being renominated for a second term, that suggests a less dovish outlook for monetary policy than under a potential Brainard leadership. So, it looks like there’s greater scope for U.S. rate hikes under Powell with Powell remaining on as the Fed Chair and that has been broadly positive for the dollar.”",0
801,"TEGUCIGALPA, Nov 22(Reuters) - The top two contenders to be the next president of Honduras held boisterous final rallies over the weekend, one week ahead of an election that could end diplomatic support for Taiwan in the Central American country if the leftist candidate wins.
On Monday, a visiting U.S. diplomat called for ""free, fair and transparent elections"" following a meeting with Honduran electoral authority CNE, in a fresh sign of American interest in the Nov. 28 vote.
Should poll leader Xiomara Castro, of the leftist opposition Libre Party, beat the ruling National Party's Nasry Asfura and put an end to its dozen-year run in power, she would also become the first woman to be president in Honduras.
""We're going to take out the dictatorship,"" she thundered on Sunday, before thousands of supporters in downtown Tegucigalpa, in a nod to the bitterly disputed re-election of outgoing President Juan Orlando Hernandez in 2017.
Castro is running on an anti-corruption platform, while also favoring a partial legalization of abortion and a diplomatic opening to China, which would mark a major shift from country's current embrace of Taiwan over Beijing.
""As a united opposition, we say enough to so much thieving, so much corruption and drug trafficking,"" said Castro, who has also pointed to the conviction of Hernandez's younger brother on drug charges in the United States earlier this year.
In a visible reminder of the united opposition backing her, Castro's crowd was also peppered with the flags of the party of her running mate, television host Salvador Nasralla, the 2017 runner-up who describes his views as center-right.
Brian Nichols, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, arrived in Honduras on Sunday and met with a local elections watchdog prior to holding talks with CNE officials on Monday, according to posts on social media.
""I underscored U.S. support for free, fair, transparent and peaceful elections in Honduras,"" Nichols wrote on Twitter.
Castro, 62, is the wife of former President Manuel Zelaya, who was deposed in a 2009 coup, after business and military leaders allied against him.
Presidential hopeful Asfura, a 63-year-old two-term mayor of the capital, held his own final rally on Sunday at a baseball stadium, projecting confidence despite trailing in a recent poll.
""We're going to create jobs and opportunity,"" he said. ""We're going to work hard on social programs that bring progress and development to the entire country.""
Both candidates also held final rallies with supporters on Saturday in Honduras' second biggest city and industrial hub, San Pedro Sula.
Unlike Castro, Asfura has not offered a detailed campaign platform.
A poll earlier this month showed Castro with a 17 point lead, but some analysts still expect a tight race.",0
802,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury could be able to fund government operations into the first half of January without a debt ceiling increase, according to a new estimate by money market research firm Wrightson ICAP on Monday.
Wrightson said in a note to clients that based on the Treasury's debt issuance plans, the department should be able to go well past a new Dec. 15 deadline set last week by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. She said that ""under certain scenarios"" the Treasury would lack sufficient resources and risk default after Dec. 15 after making a $118 billion transfer to the Highway Trust Fund.
Yellen again urged Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit as soon as possible, but a longer deadline would provide Democrats more room for maneuvering as they struggle to pass a sweeping, $1.75 trillion social and climate spending bill without Republican votes.
""Our own updated base case is that the Treasury will have enough resources to meet its obligations until the first half of January,"" Wrightson wrote. ""There is some risk that it might run into trouble in the final couple of days of December, but there is also some chance that the drop-dead date might not arrive until after the mid-January non-withheld individual income tax deadline.""
Wrightson said the Treasury was hoping the debt ceiling issue would be resolved well before mid-January, but it had begun to fine-tune its bill issuance in case it was ""still on a short leash"" in the second half of December.
It said a 35-day cash management bill due to be sold on Tuesday would come due on Dec. 31, which would help the Treasury accommodate the settlement of end-December note and bond auctions.
The firm said it expected a string of ""off-cycle"" cash management bill issuances in coming weeks.

Powell, 68, will need to be confirmed by the Senate, currently controlled by Biden's Democratic party but closely divided.

804,"TURIN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Juventus face an important test in the battle for top spot in Champions League Group H against Chelsea, Massimiliano Allegri said on Monday, but the head coach admitted his side are still struggling for goals since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.
The Italians head to London having already qualified for the last-16 with a perfect record after four games, sitting three points ahead of the English Premier League side.
But Chelsea, who suffered a 1-0 defeat to Juve in Turin in September, are aiming to knock Allegri's side off top spot and could have record signing Romelu Lukaku back from injury to help their cause.
""Tomorrow we face off for first place against a team that's on top of the Premier League and won the Champions League last season,"" Allegri told a news conference.
""With Lukaku they play in a different way. Without him they have fewer reference points and more counter-attacking players. It'll be an important test for us.""
Juve have struggled domestically this season, winning six of their 13 matches, including a 2-0 victory over Lazio in Rome on Saturday, to sit eighth in Serie A.
Their top scorer this season is Paulo Dybala, with six goals across all competitions, but Allegri said that the Argentina international's involvement is doubtful as he continues his recovery from injury.
The coach demanded more from his team in attack as they continue to struggle for goals since last season's Serie A top-scorer Ronaldo left for Manchester United in the off-season.
""We must improve our finishing. We're creating good chances and making mistakes with the final ball,"" Allegri said.
""In Rome we ran risks by not finishing our chances and then allowing counter-attacks. We've scored 18 goals and conceded 15 (in Serie A), we need to find more goals as a team.""
He added: ""Everywhere Cristiano has gone, he's always been the top scorer. We have a lot of players who can score goals, but at the moment we aren't finding them.""",0

S&P 500 (.SPX) companies have made record quarterly share repurchases in Q3 2021, amounting to $225 billion, topping the previous record of $223 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.
Given the annual record of $806 billion set in 2019, a December quarter buyback as well as the remaining unreported Q3 of $204 billion in repurchases would set a new annual record, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note on Saturday. The 12-month high is $823 billion, set in the 12-months ending in March, 2019.
""At this point, I've penciled in a new annual record, with a new 12-month record being in the works,"" Silverblatt said.
Buybacks have roared back this year after bottoming out at $89 billion in the second quarter of last year as the U.S. economy shutdown due to the pandemic.

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT)
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.
Meanwhile, the IXIC ended at an all-time high on Friday. That makes 46 record closes so far in 2021 vs 55 for all of last year.
However, one measure of the Composite's internal strength has once again broken down:
After hitting a high of 75.7% earlier this month, which was well shy of its 2021 peaks, the Nasdaq New High/New Low (NH/NL) index fell to 53.3% on Friday. That was its weakest reading, with the IXIC at a record close, since Aug. 30. Back then, five trading days later, the Composite topped and then slid as much as 8% into its October trough.
Of note, just since early 2020, there have been five sharp IXIC declines from record high-territory, averaging about 15%, all of which were preceded by multi-week/multi-month NH/NL index divergence.
Unless this measure can at least reclaim its descending 10-day moving average, the risk is that it continues to trend down to test the 2020 trough, which was at 1.2%.
Additionally of note, last week saw three Hindenburg Omens triggered on the Nasdaq, and two on the NYSE Composite (.NYA). 
These clusters can highlight an especially fractured market, vulnerable to instability.

806,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was nominated for a second four-year term by President Joe Biden on Monday, extending a tenure that began somewhat by chance, survived blistering criticism from former President Donald Trump, and now positions the ex-investment banker to finish the most consequential revamp of monetary policy since the 1970s.
Below is the full statement from the Write House:
Today, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Jerome Powell for a second term as Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and to nominate Dr. Lael Brainard to serve as Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
While our country still faces challenges as we emerge from the pandemic, we have made enormous progress in bringing our economy back to life and getting Americans back to work. Since the President took office, the economy has created over 5.6 million jobs, unemployment has fallen to 4.6% – two years faster than projected – and the pace of our economy’s growth outstrips the rest of the developed world.
That outcome is a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track. Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve.
During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.
Powell and Brainard share the Administration’s focus on ensuring that economic growth broadly benefits all workers. That’s why they oversaw a landmark re-evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives to refocus its mission on the needs of workers of all backgrounds. And they’ve advanced key priorities that the President shares, like addressing the financial risks posed by climate change, and staying ahead of emerging risks to our financial system.
America needs steady, independent, and effective leadership at the Federal Reserve so it can advance its dual goals of keeping inflation low and prices stable, as well as creating a strong labor market that broadly benefits workers with better jobs and higher wages. President Biden has full confidence in Powell and Brainard’s experience, judgment, and integrity to continue delivering on those mandates and to help build our economy back better for working families.
President Biden still has three vacant seats on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to fill, including the important position of Vice Chair for Supervision.  The President intends to make those appointments beginning in early December, and is committed to improving the diversity in the Board’s composition.
Statement from President Biden
“While there’s still more to be done, we’ve made remarkable progress over the last 10 months in getting Americans back to work and getting our economy moving again. That success is a testament to the economic agenda I’ve pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken under Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard to help steer us through the worst downturn in modern American history and put us on the path to recovery. As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before. Together, they also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system. Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs.”
Jerome Powell for Chair
Jerome Powell took office as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in February 2018, for a four-year term ending in February 2022. His term as a member of the Board of Governors will expire January 31, 2028.
Powell was born in Washington, D.C. He received a bachelor’s degree in politics from Princeton University in 1975 and earned a law degree from Georgetown University in 1979. While at Georgetown, he was editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Law Journal.
Powell served as an assistant secretary and as undersecretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. There, he was responsible for policy on financial institutions, the Treasury debt market, and related areas. In 2011, Powell was nominated by President Obama to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, where he served as a Governor until his confirmation as Chairman in 2018. Before public service, he worked as a lawyer and investment banker in New York City.
Dr. Lael Brainard for Vice Chair
Lael Brainard took office as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in June 2014 to fill an unexpired term ending January 31, 2026.
Prior to her appointment to the Board, Dr. Brainard served as undersecretary of the US Department of Treasury from 2010 to 2013 and counselor to the secretary of the Treasury in 2009. From 2001 to 2008, she was vice president and the founding director of the Global Economy and Development Program at the Brookings Institution. Dr. Brainard also previously served as deputy national economic adviser for President Clinton. From 1990 to 1996, she was assistant and associate professor of applied economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
Dr. Brainard received a BA with university honors from Wesleyan University in 1983. She received an MS and a PhD in economics in 1989 from Harvard University, where she was awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship. She is also the recipient of a White House Fellowship.",0
807,"MANILA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Relatives of people killed in the Philippines' war on drugs have accused the government of attempting to evade accountability by asking the International Criminal Court (ICC) to defer its investigation.
The ICC, which in September approved an investigation into President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs in which thousands of people have died, on Saturday temporarily suspended the probe at Manila's request.
""I am gripped by anger. I almost threw my cellphone when I read the news,"" said Normita Lopez, 57, whose son died in the anti-drugs campaign, her voice cracking with emotion.
""They are obviously scared of being investigated"" she said.
The government, which previously refused to cooperate with the ICC, told the court on Nov. 10, that its legal system was more than capable of addressing suspected rights abuses.
""The Court may only exercise jurisdiction where national legal systems fail to do so, which is certainly not the case in the Philippines,"" its letter to the ICC said.
Governments can ask the ICC to defer a case if they are implementing their own investigations. A few weeks after ICC judges approved its probe, the Philippines said it had reviewed  50 cases that indicated foul play.
Still, Kristina Conti, who represents Lopez and other relatives of victims, expects the ICC to resume its probe.
""Our bet is that the ICC will determine the investigation is not genuine,"" Conti told Reuters.
Philippine Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said he had encouraged the victims' families to file complaints directly with the ministry and make use of a witness protection programme.
The release of details of the 50 drug war deaths marked a rare admission by the state that abuses may have taken place.
""Why is the government only doing this now? Is it because they were rattled by the ICC?,"" asked Llore Pasco, 67, whose two sons were killed in the crackdown. ""They should have started investigating soon as the killings began in 2016.""
Since Duterte unleashed his drugs war, security forces say more than 6,000 suspected drug dealers have been killed because they fought back violently. Rights groups say authorities summarily executed them.
Among those killed was high-school student Kian delos Santos, whose death in 2017 led to the first convictions of police officers in the drug war, and featured in a report by a former ICC prosecutor.
""The families look at the ICC as a source of hope,"" said delos Santos' uncle, Randy.",0

809,"MANCHESTER, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Manchester United captain Harry Maguire said the players must share a ""big responsibility"" for manager Ole Gunnar Solskajer's sacking following a dreadful run of results.
The Norwegian parted company with the club on Sunday after nearly three years as permanent manager -- a shambolic 4-1 Premier League defeat at Watford proving the final straw.
Solskjaer's former assistant Michel Carrick has been put in temporary charge while an interim manager is chosen.
Speaking ahead of Tuesday's crucial Champions League clash away to Spanish club Villarreal, Maguire said Solskjaer's dismissal had been an emotional day for the squad.
""It has been a very hard time as players. The amount of respect we had for the boss. We've been on a journey together,"" Maguire, who was sent off in the defeat at Watford that left United eighth in the Premier League, told reporters.
""The players need to take a big responsibility. Ultimately the manager has paid the price, we're all so disappointed by that. We know we haven't been good enough. We've spoken about that. The lads want to succeed.""
After a bright start to the season, following the arrival of signings such as Jadon Sancho and Cristiano Ronaldo, United have slumped alarmingly and have lost four of their last five league games, shipping 15 goals in the process.
""It hasn't been good enough, not delivering individually or collectively. It snowballed from one thing to another,"" Maguire said. ""We have to find something within ourselves to find that focus and mentality.
""The manager came in and spoke to us (yesterday), it was an emotional day. He was a legend, he'll remain one.""
Carrick, who worked with Solskjaer for three years, also said it had been an emotional farewell to the former striker but added his priority now was gaining the win against Villarreal that could all but seal United's place in the last 16.
Giving little away about the club's plans to replace Solskjaer, former midfielder Carrick said he would give his best whether it is one game, two games or a stretch longer in charge.
""It's not the time to look back now, I know what I could have done in my own mind better,"" he said.
""It's easy to look elsewhere, as a player I was exactly the same. For me what's next is a flight to Spain and preparing for tomorrow. All I've been thinking about is the game.
""We have a big game on the weekend (against Chelsea) but we will address that whenever we need to. As long as club want me I will give my best.""
United lost to Villarreal on penalties in last season's Europa League final but avenged that with a 2-1 home victory in September - when Ronaldo scored a stoppage-time winner.
Group F is extremely tight though with United and Villarreal both on seven points from four games and Italian club Atalanta on five points and Young Boys of Switzerland on three.",0

811,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Cybersecurity startup Arctic Wolf, which recently raised funding at a valuation of over $4 billion, is seeking to hire financial advisors for a stock market listing early next year in the United States, a top executive told Reuters.
Arctic Wolf has started interviewing investment banks and is expected to finalize advisors for its initial public offering (IPO) in the coming months.
The company raised $150 million from investors including Viking Global Investors and Owl Rock in a private funding round in July that valued the startup at $4.3 billion.
During the pandemic, Arctic Wolf benefited from higher investments in security solutions, as remote working arrangements forced companies to spend more on software tools that counter security threats.
The Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based startup is aiming to go public in the second half of 2022, according to Chief Executive Nick Schneider.
""The acceleration in our growth is in part due to the impact of COVID on businesses and that's both around digital transformation...and people starting to work from anywhere who need protections on their internal network,"" said Schneider.
Schneider, who took over as CEO in August, has been spearheading Arctic Wolf's efforts to expand internationally, as it attempts to put a governance structure in place before it goes public.
Founded in 2012, Arctic Wolf provides security software tools and services to detect and help companies recover from cybersecurity threats. Its services are used by enterprises across several industries, including healthcare, financial services and manufacturing.
Arctic Wolf generates revenue through a subscription model, which has grown by over 100% in the past year, it said.

812,"JERUSALEM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel held its benchmark interest rate (ILINR=ECI) at 0.1% for a 13th straight policy meeting on Monday, citing uncertainty regarding economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic while inflation remained under control.
""Recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity,"" the central bank said. ""The (monetary) committee will therefore continue to conduct an accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time.""
The central bank also said that while it had completed a $30 billion foreign currency purchase programme to curb the shekel's  gains, ""the committee emphasizes that this is not an upper bound for intervention, and that the bank continues to act taking into account the state of the economy.""
The shekel last week reached a 26-year high versus the dollar and 20-year peak against the euro. The bank's government bond buying programme will end in December, it said.
All 16 economists polled by Reuters expected the monetary policy committee to keep rates steady after doing so ever since cutting them from 0.25% at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  read more  The next rates move is widely expected to be a rate increase in 2022 or 2023.
JPMorgan has calculated that markets are pricing in a 28 bps hike for Israel in the next 12 months, and for interest rates to rise by a total of 72 bps in the next 24 months.
The central bank said that while Israel was enjoying an economic expansion it remained concerned about the medium term, in particular the labour market, due to a view of ""risk of further morbidity cycles in Israel and abroad.""
The economy grew an annualised 2.4% in the third quarter from the prior three months after growth of 13.7% in the second quarter. Growth has come amid a COVID-19 vaccination roll-out in which 44% of Israelis have received a booster shot and the country largely free of virus-related restrictions.
That has helped lower the jobless rate to 7%.
At the same time, Israel's inflation rate dipped to 2.3% in October from an eight-year peak of 2.5% in September, remaining above the midpoint of a 1%-3% annual target range.
Policymakers noted that Israel's inflation environment differs from Europe, where some countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have hiked rates to rein in inflation.
""To date, the only interest rate increases worldwide have been in countries where inflation deviated markedly from their targets, while inflation expectations in Israel are within our target range,"" the Bank of Israel said.
It added that its own forecasts and by forecasters show the inflation rate is expected to be lower in 12 months.",0

NASDAQ COMPOSITE: FLYING ON FUMES? (0845 EST/1345 GMT
The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) is currently on pace to rise around 25% this year. That puts its rolling three-year rise on track to be 142%. That would be its biggest such rise since the three-year period ending Dec. 31, 1999, just prior to the bursting of the tech bubble.

814,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, 68, renominated by President Joe Biden for a second four-year term as leader of the world's most powerful central bank, has been on a rollercoaster ride since he joined the institution almost a decade ago. Here are some of the highlights of his time at the Fed:
2012 -- APPOINTED AS PART OF AN OBAMA DEAL
Powell, a Republican former Wall Street investment banker and private equity executive, is nominated to the Fed's Board of Governors by President Barack Obama as part of a deal alongside Jeremy Stein, a Democrat, as a way to break a stalemate over Obama's appointments in the Republican-controlled Senate.
2013 -- ADVOCATE FOR WITHDRAWING STIMULUS
In his early days at the Fed, Powell argues forcefully for the central bank to start reducing its massive bond purchases undertaken to support the economy's recovery from the financial crisis, which had added $4 trillion to the Fed’s balance sheet. He wants the process to begin regardless of whether there is substantial improvement in the unemployment rate. Pressure from him and a two others on the Board forces Chair Ben Bernanke's hand into telling lawmakers the Fed would reduce its pace of purchases in coming meetings, which leads to months of market turbulence known as the ""taper tantrum.""
2017 -- POWELL BECOMES FED CHAIR
President Donald Trump jettisons bipartisan tradition and decides not to renominate Janet Yellen, a Democrat, as chair. Influenced by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, he elevates  Powell, who is now viewed as a centrist at the Fed and enjoys good relations among both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, to replace her. ""He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,”  Trump says. The U.S. Senate votes to confirm him 84-13.
2018 -- TRUMP INSULTS BEGIN... AND NEVER END
In his first year as chair, Powell's Fed raises interest rates four times amid a strong economy and low unemployment. But in another departure from previous presidents, Trump frequently demands the central bank, which is self-funded and independent from the White House, change course and cut rates to zero or even introduce negative interest rates. As Powell reiterates the Fed's independence, Trump publicly calls those at the Fed ""boneheads,"" and ""pathetic"" and threatens to fire Powell. In 2019, in the midst of a trade row with China, he compares Powell to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. ""My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?"" Trump asks. Powell responds that he will not resign if Trump requests him to.
2019 -- POWELL'S ROCKY YEAR AMID BALANCE SHEET WOES
At the end of 2018, Powell sends markets tumbling when he implies the Fed's bond-shedding program is on auto pilot, a message he hastily walks back in January amid concerns the Fed is ignoring signs of a worsening economy. The Fed cuts interest rates three times in 2019 to forestall a slowdown fueled largely by the U.S.-China trade war.
The Fed's balance sheet policy comes under further scrutiny after a liquidity shortage in the $2.2 trillion repo market, which underpins much of the U.S. financial system, causes a surge in short-term borrowing costs in September. The Fed is forced to pump money in on an ongoing basis in its first major market intervention since the financial crisis.
2020 -- FED TO THE RESCUE AS COVID-19 PANDEMIC HITS
When the coronavirus pandemic hits, Powell acts swiftly, cutting interest rates to near zero and enacting a slew of emergency programs to prop up a cratering U.S. economy. He pledges open-ended Fed support and argues for unfettered fiscal spending. The Fed begins a $120 billion a month bond-buying program and stretches its remit further, offering open-ended credit to financial markets, first-ever purchases of corporate bonds, and loans to individual businesses. ""We crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before,"" Powell says in May, adding he has no regrets.
2020 -- FED CHANGES FRAMEWORK TO PRIORITIZE JOBS
In August, the Fed completes a two-year review of its framework, designed to promote maximum employment and financial stability. Under Powell, it reshapes its approach to monetary policy to emphasize employment growth, and a greater tolerance for higher inflation without raising interest rates. Powell also enshrines the concept of its employment goal as being broad-based and inclusive, in line with Powell's own view of ""the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.""
2021 - ETHICS SCANDAL ROCKS THE CENTRAL BANK
The usually staid institution experiences tumult with the departure of two regional Fed Bank presidents amid controversy over trades they made the previous year at a time when the central bank was heavily influencing the economy to try and nurse it through the pandemic, and senior officials were internally advised to adhere to a 'trading blackout' for several months. Critics cite the uproar as evidence of Powell's unsuitability for a second term. Six weeks after the scandal breaks, Powell announces the Fed will ban individual stock purchases by its senior ranks and unveils a broad set of other restrictions on their investing activities.
2021 - WHAT NEXT FOR FED'S MONETARY AND REGULATORY POLICIES?
In December 2020, Powell's Fed sets a bar of ""substantial further progress"" toward its full employment and 2% average inflation goals before reducing its bond-buying program, a goal it met by early November this year. The Fed has now begun the bond-buying taper, its first major move in bringing crisis-era policies to an end.
Elsewhere, the Fed's shift toward a more jobs-focused monetary policy is already competing with the persistence of higher-than-expected inflation, with investors now betting on an interest rate liftoff from near zero as soon as mid-2022.
As Powell looks to his next four years, the Fed will also have to grapple with other issues, such as determining if there is a need for tougher financial regulation, whether to issue its own digital currency and how to mitigate climate change risks as part of its supervisory role.  read more ",0
815,"ROME, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The mayor of the Italian island of Vulcano, off the northern coast of Sicily, has ordered a partial night evacuation of an area close to the harbour due to worries over potentially dangerous gases from volcanic activity.
The order, effective from Monday and valid for the next month, means some 300 residents will not be allowed to sleep in their homes between 11 p.m. (2200 GMT) and 6 a.m.
Tourism will also be banned on the island, which is part of the Aeolian archipelago.
""The unconsciousness of sleep would not allow them to detect the risks,"" mayor Marco Giorgianni told Reuters, adding that evacuees would be accommodated elsewhere on the island.
In a report last week, Italy's National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the level of carbon dioxide was ""abnormally high"" around the crater of the volcano, which last erupted from 1888 to 1890.
Local media reported several families had already left their houses late in October due to the gases, after the civil protection agency issued an alert on ""significant"" alterations in volcanic parameters.
The municipality will provide grants to help those forced to find another place to stay, but life on the island will carry on as usual during the day, Giorgianni said.
Angela Borgia, who runs a restaurant in the harbour area, said that while islanders were concerned about the gases, it would be difficult to move the elderly and sick for the night.

Nutresa shares opened up 27.64% at 27,750 Colombian pesos ($7.07), moderating to 27,310 pesos by around 1500 GMT.
Trading was suspended on Nov. 11 after Nutresa received a public acquisition offer from Nugil SAS, controlled by financial conglomerate Grupo Gilinski, to buy between 50.1% and 62.62% of the shares in circulation.
The acquisition, which has initial authorization from Colombia's financial regulator, would take place between Nov. 29 and Dec. 17 at a share price of $7.71, raising a total of between $1.77 billion and $2.2 billion.
Nugil SAS published an advisory of the acquisition offer over the weekend.
Late on Sunday major shareholders Grupo Argos (ARG.CN) and Grupo SURA (SIS.CN) said not enough information had been made available about the possible takeover because Nugil did not present offer documents with details of the transaction before the regulator or the Colombian stock exchange.
""The lack of complete information in relation to the public acquisition creates uncertainty for the market and makes impossible a comprehensive analysis of the offer by shareholders in Grupo Nutresa SAS,"" Grupo Argos said in a statement.
Colombia's stock exchange said it received complete documentation early on Monday and the information is now on its website.
Grupo Gilinski said all documentation complies with the law.
Nutresa operates around Latin America, as well as in the United States and Malaysia. It makes processed meat, cookies, chocolate, coffee, pasta and ice cream and has a line of restaurants and ice cream shops.

819,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures dropped over 5% to a near 11-week low on Monday on forecasts for milder than normal weather and lower demand over the next two weeks than previously expected.
Traders said prices also slumped on near record U.S. output, healthy U.S. stockpiles and a decline in European gas futures .
Front-month gas futures  fell 27.6 cents, or 5.4%, to settle at $4.789 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest close since Sept. 7.
Traders noted the front-month briefly dipped below its 100-day moving average on Monday for the first time since April.
Before the latest price drop, speculators boosted their net long positions on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges last week for the first time since September as liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports jumped to record highs with soaring global gas prices keeping demand for U.S. LNG strong. 
Global gas prices had hit record highs as utilities around the world scrambled for LNG cargoes to replenish extremely low stockpiles in Europe and meet insatiable demand in Asia, where energy shortfalls have caused power blackouts in China.
Following those global gas prices, U.S. futures jumped to a 12-year high in early October, but have pulled back since because the United States has plenty of gas in storage and ample production for the winter. Overseas prices continue to trade about six times higher than U.S. futures.
Analysts have said European inventories were about 17% below normal for this time of year, compared with just 2% below normal in the United States.
Data provider Refinitiv said output in the U.S. Lower 48 states averaged 96.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in November, up from 94.1 bcfd in October and a monthly record of 95.4 bcfd in November 2019.
Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise to 114.1 bcfd next week from 111.4 bcfd this week as the weather turns seasonally colder and homes and businesses crank up their heaters. The forecast for next week, however, was lower than Refinitiv's forecast on Friday.
The amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants averaged 11.2 bcfd so far in November, up from 10.5 bcfd in October as the sixth train at Cheniere Energy Inc's (LNG.A) Sabine Pass plant in Louisiana started producing LNG in test mode. That compares with a monthly record of 11.5 bcfd in April.  read more 
With gas prices around $27 per mmBtu in Europe  and $34 in Asia , compared with about $5 in the United States, traders said buyers around the world will keep purchasing all the LNG the United States can produce.
But no matter how high global gas prices rise, the United States only has the capacity to turn about 11.1 bcfd of gas into LNG. The rest of the gas flowing to the export plants is used to fuel equipment that produces the LNG.
Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more when Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana starts producing LNG in test mode.  read more ",0
820,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was briefly left lost for words on Monday when he lost his place in notes during a speech before regaling business leaders with an anecdote about his recent visit to a Peppa Pig theme park.
Searching through his notes, Johnson sighed, said ""blast it"" and repeatedly muttered ""forgive me"" as he briefly interrupted his speech to the Confederation of British Industry in Port of Tyne, northern England.
He recovered, talking about technology ""unicorns"" and then a visit to Peppa Pig World, a park based on the children's animated TV show about an exuberant pink pig and her friends and family.
""Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World,"" Johnson told the business executives. ""I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place: it has very safe streets, discipline in schools.""
Johnson asked the audience of business executives who had been to the theme park in Hampshire, southern England, which says it is the world's largest Peppa Pig World and ""perfect for toddlers"".
""I am surprised you haven't been there,"" Johnson said to those executives who had not visited the park, which includes various rides for young fans of Peppa.
""Who would have believed that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly a Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC, would now be exported to 180 countries with theme parks both in America and China?""
In the speech, Johnson, who also performed an impression of a car, told business leaders about what he terms the green industrial revolution. He also said the job of government should sometimes be to ""get out of your hair"" and ensure less regulation and taxation.
Johnson was unabashed when reporters asked him about the speech and said he had made the points he had wanted.
""I think that people got the vast majority of the points I wanted to make,"" Johnson said. ""I thought it went over well.""
Johnson has had a difficult couple of weeks, being criticised for his handling of a ""sleaze"" crisis over lawmakers (MPs) being paid for second jobs outside parliament, and accused of policy reversals on high-speed rail and social care plans.  read more

821,"ATHENS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Greece will hand out one-off grants to low-income pensioners and medical staff ahead of Christmas to shield them from higher energy and food prices, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Monday.
Consumer inflation hit a multi-year high of 3.4% in   October with costs in the housing sector rising by an annual 7.8%, mainly due to rising electricity, heating oil and natural gas prices. 
The government has already spent about 700 million euros ($790 million)on subsidies for the majority of Greek households to make energy costs more affordable. It also lowered VAT for farmers and animal breeders.
Mitsotakis said 800,000 pensioners on low incomes and 173,000 disabled people would each get a one-off handout of 250 euros before the end of the year.
""We are responding to the short-term rise in prices without putting the fiscal balance at risk,"" Mitsotakis said during a parliamentary debate on recent price increases.
He said inflation should start to decline from the first quarter of 2022.
A Finance Ministry official told Reuters that the total cost of the new measures will be about 300 million euros, easily covered by the budget.
Greece expects its economy to grow 4.5% in 2022 after a jump of 6.9% this year, due to higher tourist intake and pent-up demand.  read more 
Mitsotakis said about 100.000 medical staff in the public sector will get a bonus of half a month's salary, or about 900 euros on average.
Greece joined several other European countries last week in imposing more restrictions on those unvaccinated against COVID-19 following a surge in infections.

823,"ABIDJAN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Rainfall was at or below five-year averages in most of Ivory Coast’s cocoa-growing regions last week, but the soil's high moisture content should keep hopes alive for strong main-crop output, farmers said on Monday.
Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, is entering the dry season in which downpours are poor or scarce from about mid-November to March.
The main crop will be in its final stage from February to March. Farmers hope uncharacteristically heavy rains that lasted until last week will keep plants adequately hydrated until then.
Some farmers told Reuters that a steady supply of well-dried and quality beans are expected as the harvest begins to pick up. The volume of beans will be important to monitor through the coming months, they said.
In the western region of Soubre and the eastern region of Abengourou, where rains were average and slightly above average respectivly, farmers said rainfall was sufficient to maintain development of next year's harvest.
“There will be no problem with harvesting until late January. Plenty of big pods are almost ripe,” said Denis Tokpa, who farms near Soubre, where 17.3 millimetres (mm) of rain fell last week, in line with the five-year average.
In the southern regions of Agboville and Divo, where rains were below average, farmers said growing conditions were good and buyers were happy with the quality of beans.
Rains were below average in the centre-western region of Daloa and in the central regions of Bongouanou and Yamoussoukro, but farmers said the soil moisture content was adequate.
Light rains through December would strengthen their expectations for a strong main-crop finish, but the looming Harmattan season, when dust sweeps down from the Sahara desert from December to March, could lead to excessive dryness.
Average temperatures ranged from 27.3 to 30.3 Celsius degrees in Ivory Coast last week.",0
824,"LISBON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Portugal shut down its last remaining coal plant over the weekend, ending the use of the polluting material for electricity generation and becoming the fourth country in the European Union to do so.
Environmental group Zero said in a statement the Pego plant in central Portugal had been the country's second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, adding that ""freeing ourselves from the biggest source of greenhouse gases was a momentous day for Portugal"".
The move comes nine years before Portugal's targeted end of the use of the fossil fuel by 2030.
Belgium, Austria and Sweden are the other three European countries to have already stopped using coal for power generation.
Although a hefty 60%-70% of its electricity comes from renewable sources, Portugal still relies heavily on imported fossil fuels to meet overall energy needs.
There are concerns the Pego plant, run by the privately held group Tejo Energia, might now be converted to burn wood pellets.
""The challenge now is to ensure utilities do not make the mistake of replacing coal with fossil gas, or unsustainable biomass,"" said Kathrin Gutmann, campaign director at Europe Beyond Coal.
""Ditching coal only to switch to the next worst fuel is clearly not an answer,"" said Zero's president Francisco Ferreira. ""Instead, the focus should be on rapidly upscaling our renewable energy capacity in wind and solar.""
A draft document seen by Reuters in June showed the EU was considering tightening rules on whether wood-burning energy could be classified as renewable.  read more ",0
825,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Petroleum futures and options were hit by heavy profit-taking last week as speculation about a potential release of strategic oil reserves and intensifying concerns about the state of the global economy hit sentiment.
Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 57 million barrels in the six most important petroleum-related futures and options contracts in the week to Nov. 16.
Last week's sales were the highest for more than three months, according to position records from ICE Futures Europe and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (https://tmsnrt.rs/30Os1n7).
The heaviest selling was concentrated in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-34 million barrels) and Brent (-18 million), consistent with the possibility of a strategic stocks release led by the United States.
Among the other contracts, sales of U.S. diesel (-2 million barrels) and European gas oil (-12 million) were largely offset by purchases of U.S. gasoline (+9 million).
Across the six major contracts, portfolio managers have been sellers in five out of the last six weeks, reducing their positions by an aggregate 134 million barrels since Oct. 5.
The combined position has fallen to 736 million barrels (66th percentile for all weeks since 2013) down from 871 million barrels (79th percentile) at the start of October.
The adjustment has come mostly from the liquidation of previous bullish long positions (-115 million barrels) rather than the creation of new bearish shorts (+19 million), consistent with profit-taking after a big rally.
As a result, the combined position has become less lopsided, with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of 5.3:1 (71st percentile) down from 7.0:1 (87th percentile) in mid-October.
The transformation has been especially noticeable in Brent crude, where fund managers have cut their position by 111 million barrels in the last six weeks.
Brent positions have fallen from 333 million barrels (68th percentile) to just 222 million barrels (41st percentile) while the long-short ratio has tumbled from 6.3:1 (68th percentile) to just 3.4:1 (31st percentile).
By the start of October, speculation in the oil market had become overheated, with most investors anticipating further big gains in prices, even as prices were touching their highest level for three years.
Since then, concerns about the sustainability of the global economic expansion and the resurgence of coronavirus cases in Europe and North America have taken some of the heat out of oil prices.
The futures market is moving into the seasonally weaker half of the year, with talk about a coordinated release of strategic stocks adding to downward risks, prompting fund managers to realise some profits from the earlier rally.

The talks took place amid intensified concerns about tensions over Ukraine that Russia on Monday compared to the build-up to a 2008 war in which Russian forces crushed those of neighbouring Georgia.  read more 
Putin told Draghi that Ukraine was not fulfilling its obligations under the Minsk and Normandy settlement agreements, the Kremlin said in a statement.
""Of particular concern are provocative steps by the Ukrainian side to deliberately exacerbate the situation in Donbass, including the use of weapons prohibited by the Minsk package of measures,"" Putin told Draghi, referring to a swathe of eastern Ukraine seized by Russia-backed separatists.
The United States and fellow NATO member Turkey have supplied Ukraine respectively with Javelin anti-tank missiles and attack drones, while Britain is supporting the Ukrainian navy.
Ukraine says it is upgrading its combat capabilities to defend itself against possible Russian aggression. The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of provocation, saying it was being supplied with a significant amount of arms, including high-tech weapons.
Putin also told Draghi that Russia stood ready to ensure a flawless supply of natural gas to Europe, including via the Nord Stream 2 project.
Last week, Germany temporarily halted the certification process for the new pipeline that will carry Russian gas into Europe, throwing up a new roadblock to the contentious project and driving up regional gas prices.  read more ",0

830,"JERUSALEM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - An Israeli state inquiry into a crush that killed 45 people, including Americans and Canadians, at a Jewish pilgrimage site in April recommended on Monday that future admissions be capped and ceremonies streamlined in order to prevent overcrowding.
The panel, headed by a former Supreme Court chief justice, submitted interim findings designed to help authorities better plan for the next festival at Meron, the Galilee tomb of second-century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, on May 18-19.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual commemorations could draw as many as 200,000 worshippers for all-night prayer, mystical songs, picnics and dance around bonfires.
Tens of thousands came on April 30 to the hilltop pilgrimage site, which covers about 5.6 acres. When a crowd surged into a narrow tunnel, 45 men and boys were asphyxiated or trampled to death. Six victims were Americans, two were Canadian.
""The material brought before the commission and testimonies heard by it indicate that the maximal number of people that could be safely contained at the area at the same time is approximately 20,000,"" the panel said in a 16-page report.
While not recommending a target number, it said more space could be freed up by banning tents and pirate vendors at the site and by holding one central bonfire ceremony.
Pilgrims could be encouraged to rotate by bussing them in and out on tickets valid for specific hours, the panel said. It advised against allowing in food to ""reduce the duration of stay (and) the danger of falling and slipping on garbage"".
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's government signalled it would implement the findings.
""The 2022 observances at Meron will be entirely different from the observances held heretofore, and will take place according to other safety standards,"" Religious Affairs Minister Matan Kahana said in a statement.

831,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Eddie Jones's vision of a ""New England"" has moved a little into sharper focus via a hat-trick of November victories but the project remains very much a work in progress and all geared towards the 2023 World Cup, the coach said on Monday.
After beating Tonga and Australia, England signed off with a dramatic 27-26 victory over world champions South Africa on Saturday, scoring three superb backline tries in the process.
Conceding 18 penalties - England have averaged 13 over their last 10 games - was a downside as they struggled to deal with South Africa's dominance for long periods but, coming off a fifth-placed finish in the Six Nations, it was undoubtedly a positive month.
""We set out at the start of the autumn to create a New England which evolved around changing selection, bringing some younger players in and being more aggressive without attack as the game required,"" Jones told a news conference.
""While we've had good results, there's a lot of improvement in us, but the great thing is that we've got four campaigns until the World Cup in 2023 so the Six Nations is a great opportunity for us to keep improving.""
After the kick and chase approach that England followed last year, their willingness to get the ball into the hands of their talented backs has been one of the most uplifting aspects of the autumn.
Jones, however, said that was less to do with a change of approach from him and more to do with adapting to a shift in emphasis by World Rugby and match officials.
""It's a direct reflection of the way the game is being refereed. The speed of the ruck ball dictates how you can play rugby - always has and always will,"" he said.
Jones did, however, give credit to ""absolutely outstanding"" new attack coach Martin Gleeson.
""His eye for detail, his understanding of the game is first-class and him and Anthony Seibold in that attack/defence area have really made a good impression on the team and they'll continue to add value as we go along.""
Jones, who said he had capped 23 new players this year, was also pleased with how he has deepened his squad, on the back of summer games against Canada and the United States.
""We've had our challenges in terms of COVID and injuries, where maybe some young guys we thought weren't ready to play at that level of game have been given their opportunity and acquitted themselves really well,"" he said.
""So, we've added to the depth, we've added to the competition and we've also added to the hunger of the side, which is really important, because with the development of some of the younger players it puts enormous competitive strains on getting selected, which is a good position to be in.""
Jones picked out hooker Nic Dolly as a great example of how quickly things can change.
""He was going back to play for Coventry, he got a call up from Leicester and played four or five games for them and finds himself in the England squad, coming up against the best pack in the world and making his debut in front of 82,000 people at Twickenham,"" Jones said.
""What a story in terms of resilience, in terms of just keep doing your work and when the opportunity comes – take it.""",0
832,"JERUSALEM/DUBAI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Israel and Jordan have signed a declaration of intent for a water-for-energy deal, Israel's Energy Ministry said on Monday, in the first such deal between the two countries.
The project would see Jordan build 600 megawatts of solar generating capacity which would be exported to Israel, contingent upon Israel providing water-scarce Jordan with 200 million cubic metres of desalinated water.
Feasibility studies would start in 2022, said a statement from Israel's diplomatic mission in the United Arab Emirates, where the deal was signed.
It has not been decided over how long the agreement would be carried out.
The deal was signed by the UAE's climate change minister,     Jordan's minister of water and irrigation and Israel's energy minister at the Expo 2020 world fair currently being hosted by Dubai.
The UAE, which became the first Gulf state to normalise relations with Israel last year, said it was pleased to play a role in bringing the two countries together in demonstrating the benefits of establishing diplomatic relations.
""All residents of the Middle East will benefit from this memorandum of understanding, not just Jordan and Israel. This is a message to the world on how countries can act together to fight the climate crisis,"" said Israel's Energy Minister Karine Elharrar.
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with neighbour Israel in 1994, said on Monday the deal was not ""legally or technically"" binding and the kingdom would only proceed if it secured these quantities of water, Water and Irrigation Ministry Spokesman Omar Salamah said.
Israel, which already sells Jordan some freshwater supplies, had long sought to sell desalinated water to its neighbour, but the kingdom had resisted.
""Climate change and the influx of refugees have further exacerbated Jordan’s water challenges, however, there are many opportunities for regional cooperation to help increase sustainability in the sector,"" Jordan’s Minister of Water and Irrigation Mohammad Al-Najjar said.",0

836,"MOSCOW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign intelligence agency on Monday compared current tensions over Ukraine with the build-up to a 2008 war in which Russia's forces crushed those of neighbouring Georgia.
In a statement on its website, the SVR said Georgia's then-president Mikheil Saakashvili had ""paid a high price"" in that conflict.
The Russian rouble  fell on the comment, which comes amid concern by Ukraine, the United States and NATO over Russian troop movements near Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed reports that it might be poised to attack Ukraine as inflammatory.
Russia comprehensively defeated Georgia in their five-day war and around one-fifth of Georgia's territory remains outside Tbilisi's control, defended by Russian troops.
A U.S. Congressional source familiar with U.S. intelligence reporting said Russia now had somewhere between 90,000 and 100,000 troops deployed near its border with Ukraine.
U.S. officials say the Russian military activity along Ukraine's border creates a worrying set of options for Moscow but that it remained unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin has a made decision to invade Ukraine. None of the U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters expected an imminent attack against Ukraine, yet they said the Russian movements point toward a building crisis.
Washington hopes to avert conflict by building international consensus about the threat, the U.S. officials said, perhaps to set the stage for potential sanctions should Moscow decide to act.
Earlier, the Kremlin said U.S. media outlets that have suggested Russia is poised to attack Ukraine were being used in a disinformation campaign.
The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Kyrylo Budanov said such an attack would probably involve air strikes, artillery and armoured attacks followed by airborne assaults in the east, amphibious assaults in Odessa and Mariupol, and a smaller incursion through Belarus.  read more 
Similar warnings, often sourced to unnamed people familiar with the matter, have appeared in some U.S. media, and the United States, NATO and Ukraine have raised concerns about Russian troop movements near Ukraine in recent weeks.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the idea of a Russian attack.
'AGGRESSIVE DREAMS'
""This is whipping up tension and is another attempt to present Russia as the one threatening the process of settling the situation (in eastern Ukraine),"" he told reporters.
""And of course we cannot rule out that this is cover for aggressive dreams that Kyiv may have. I mean aggressive dreams about a possible desire to solve the problem in the southeast by force.""
Ukraine's ties with Russia collapsed in 2014 after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and backed separatists who seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine sometimes known as the Donbass - territory that Kyiv says it wants back.
But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed Peskov's comments.
""We see a surge in Russian disinfo, including false accusations of Ukraine plotting a military attack in the Donbass,"" Kuleba said in an English-language tweet.
""Let me state it officially: Ukraine does not plan a military offensive in the Donbass.""
Peskov accused Ukraine of provocation, and said it was ""being supplied with a significant amount of weapons, including modern high-tech weapons"".
""And we are observing this with great alarm,"" he said, ""knowing the significant influence of extreme-minded politicians in Ukraine.""
Ukraine says it is upgrading its combat capabilities to defend itself against possible Russian aggression.
Moscow has long opposed the idea of Ukraine joining the NATO Western military alliance, and has been increasingly emphatic in opposing NATO's expanding ties with Ukraine.
""Of course, the number of provocations is growing and growing significantly,"" Peskov said. ""These provocations are being carried out with weapons supplied by NATO countries.""
The United States and fellow NATO member Turkey have supplied Ukraine respectively with Javelin anti-tank missiles and attack drones, while Britain is supporting the Ukrainian navy.",0
837,"DUBAI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala (MUDEV.UL), which manages $243 billion in assets, expects no change in its investment strategy and themes in 2022, group chief executive Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak said on Monday.
Areas such as renewables, technology and life sciences will continue to remain themes for the state investor, Al Mubarak said at a conference.
""Thematically there is no shift in terms of our strategy,"" Al Mubarak said. ""From a short-term perspective, yes there are challenges ahead. I think inflation is creeping in many places.""
With the world coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic there is strong liquidity globally, though potential increases to interest rates would have implications, he added.

838,"BANGKOK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Thailand aims to join talks on membership of a trans-Pacific free-trade agreement, a government official said on Monday, despite opposition from some politicians and business groups over fears the pact could harm farm and healthcare businesses.
The Southeast Asian country has long expressed interest in joining the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), seeing it as way of boosting the economy, and making sectors such as electronics and agriculture more competitive against rivals such as Vietnam and Malaysia, both CPTPP members.
The government had listened to public opinion and recommendations by the lower house and would prepare counter measures for those who could be affected by membership, deputy government spokeswoman Rachada Dhnadirek said in a statement.
The CPTPP had both benefits and negative aspects that required careful consideration, she said, noting that some terms could be negotiated before joining.
""The prime minister reiterated that participating in the talks is in the best interest of Thai people, and it does not mean an agreement to join the pact immediately,"" she added.
""The plan will definitely be proposed to the cabinet to get Thailand to join the negotiations,"" Rachada told Reuters.
Opposition parties and some business groups warn tariff-free access to other CPTPP member countries could lead to a flood of agricultural and pharmaceutical imports from some of those countries and harm the industries.
China said in September that it had filed an application to join the CPTPP, which was signed by 11 countries including Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and New Zealand in 2018.",0
839,"HAMBURG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's supervisory board executive committee will meet on Tuesday to discuss the future of Chief Executive Herbert Diess, who is likely to remain at the helm of the carmaker despite tensions over his management style, sources said on Monday.
It was not clear whether any decision would be made at Tuesday's meeting, to be attended among others by works council head Daniela Cavallo and representatives of the majority shareholder families, Hans Michel Piech and Wolfgang Porsche, the sources with knowledge of the negotiations said.
But any decision would come before a Dec. 9 supervisory board meeting to discuss Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) five-year spending plan, they added, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Volkswagen and top shareholder Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE) declined to comment. German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung first reported plans for an executive committee meeting on Tuesday.
Diess and union representatives have clashed in recent weeks over his management style and electrification strategy, after the CEO warned at a previous supervisory board meeting that 30,000 jobs could be lost if the process was not managed well.
The goal of current negotiations is to announce a series of new board members alongside details on job prospects for employees and investment plans for the group as a package, the sources said.
""It looks as though the threads are coming together,"" one of the people said.
A solution will likely include the appointment of Ralf Brandstaetter, CEO of Volkswagen's namesake brand, to the management board, the people said, where he would take over responsibility for the mass-market brand group from Diess.
Diess last year ceded responsibility for the Volkswagen brand to Brandstaetter after weeks of squabbling between the company's powerful labour leaders and managers over the pace and scale of cost cutting plans.",0
840,"NAIROBI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A Kenyan government directive that residents must show proof of COVID-19 vaccination by Dec. 21 to access services was welcomed by some businesses on Monday but criticized by others, who said low vaccination rates made it unrealistic.
Only 8.8% of people are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in Kenya so far.
Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe made the announcement on Sunday. Public services affected include schools, transport services, immigration and other state offices, and hotels, bars, restaurants, national parks and wildlife reserves.
The government will start a 10-day mass vaccination campaign on Friday, Kagwe said.
Directives about vaccines have split public opinion globally. Some politicians and citizens say measures infringe on personal choice and others say they protect the public.
Carol Kariuki, chief executive of the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), which claims more than half a million members, told Reuters the group encouraged all Kenyans to get inoculated.
""This is not only good for business continuity and the economy but also to protect others,"" she said.
But some local business owners said the directive were not practical.
""Who is going to implement it?"" said Franklin Odhiambo, a restaurant owner in Nairobi. ""Some of us may want to be compliant, others may not. So, it will create some unfair competition.""
The edict comes just a month after the government lifted a curfew in place since March 2020.
Rights group Amnesty International said Kenya would not be able to vaccinate the majority of its population by the deadline, so many people might be unable to earn a living, access transport or go to school.
Irungu Houghton, executive director of Amnesty International's Kenya office, said the government directive was unrealistic and flawed.
""These regulations will deprive millions of people of their ability to earn a livelihood, to have access to security, health and transportation services back and forth from home to work or school,"" he told Reuters.
""That’s not how we will win the war against COVID-19,"" he said, calling on the government to work harder to address vaccine hesitancy.
""It turns what the WHO (World Health Organization) would argue is an important voluntary exercise into a coercive exercise.""
Shoe-shiner Winnie Buong agreed.
""They ought to have done a more aggressive vaccination campaign before lifting the lockdown,"" Buong said. ""I don’t understand why they want to make our lives more difficult.”
Though low compared to Western nations, Kenya's rate of fully vaccinated citizens is higher than the African average of under 5%. The WHO says Africa lags in COVID-19 vaccination rates due to global inequities in vaccine supplies, not because Africans do not want to be vaccinated.
Kenya has reported about 255,000 coronavirus infections and 5,300 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a Reuters tracker.",0
841,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The White House confirmed on Monday that more than 90% of the 3.5 million federal employees covered by a presidential COVID-19 vaccine mandate had received at least one dose ahead of a Monday deadline.
In total, the administration has deemed that 95% of federal workers have complied with its requirements in that they have either been vaccinated, are completing vaccinations or have a pending religious or medical exemption request, the White House said.
Officials declined to disclose the total number of fully vaccinated federal employees, but said the ""vast majority"" of the 90% had received both doses.
White House officials on Monday confirmed the figures first reported by Reuters.
The figures suggest relatively high vaccination rates for federal employees compared with the U.S. population as a whole, and underscore the Biden administration's effort to get every American inoculated in a drive to bring COVID-19 under control.
Officials said the final numbers would change as employees continue to submit documentation until the deadline later on Monday, and as all employee submissions may not yet have been processed. The figures suggest that potentially 175,000 federal employees may not be vaccinated and are not yet in compliance with the rules.
The administration has repeatedly said that it will not immediately seek to suspend or fire unvaccinated employees. Officials said the fact that thousands of employees had not yet complied would not affect holiday travel or government services.
""Already 95% of (U.S. government) employees are in compliance with the president’s vax requirement. There are no disruptions related to the requirement,"" White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said on Twitter.
White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said 99% of employees at the Federal Aviation Administration, nearly 98% of Customs and Border Protection and 93% of Transportation Security Administration employees are in compliance with the vaccine and exemption requirements.
""Looking at the federal workforce vaccination data makes one thing obvious: Vaccination requirements work,"" Zients said.
Zients added that 99% of employees at the FBI, 98% at the Internal Revenue Service and 99% of employees in the White House Executive Office of the President are in compliance.
On Nov. 1, the Pentagon said 97% of the active-duty force  had received at least one COVID-19 dose.
'EDUCATION AND COUNSELING'
The vaccine mandate imposed by President Joe Biden in September does not cover federal employees in the judicial and legislative branches or the U.S. Postal Service.
The White House has told agencies that for federal employees not in compliance, agencies should begin ""a brief period of education and counseling"" to last five days. If employees do not ""demonstrate progress toward becoming fully vaccinated,"" that ""should be followed by a short suspension"" of no more than 14 days. If an employee gets a first shot, agencies are directed to halt any disciplinary action.
Officials are confident that as the disciplinary process begins, a rising number of federal employees will get vaccinated.
On Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget will release agency-by-agency data on vaccinated employeesand those in compliance with the rules from 24 major federal agencies like the Defense Department, Transportation Department, Health and Human Services and others. More granular data will be released in the following week.
Employees who have an exemption request denied have two weeks to get their first shot and a further six weeks to get their second.",0
842,"KHARTOUM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said on Monday that maintaining the economic gains from the past two years was among the reasons he had decided to return to his post, under a deal with the military nearly a month after he was removed in a coup.
In an interview with Reuters at the Khartoum residence where he had been held under house arrest following the Oct. 25 military takeover, Hamdok said he believed a technocratic government he is expected to appoint would have a chance to improve living standards.
Prominent political parties and Sudan's powerful protest movement have opposed Hamdok's decision to sign the agreement with the military on Sunday, with some calling it a betrayal or saying it provided political cover for the coup.
""Among the reasons for my return is preserving the economic gains and the economic opening to the world,"" Hamdok said.
Since Hamdok was first appointed prime minister in 2019 under a power sharing deal following the overthrow of Omar al-Bashir, Sudan has carried out economic reforms including the lifting of fuel subsidies and a managed float of its currency.
The reforms, monitored by the International Monetary Fund, won Sudan approval for forgiveness on much of its more than $50 billion in foreign debt -- a deal that was thrown into doubt by the coup. 
The World Bank and some bilateral donors paused badly needed economic assistance after the military takeover.
""We will continue our contacts with international financial institutions, and the new budget that will begin in January will proceed on the path of economic reform and open the door to investment in Sudan,"" Hamdok said.
PEACE DEAL
The civilian coalition that had been sharing power with the military before the coup and its former ministers said they rejected the agreement, citing a violent crackdown on anti-military protests over the past month.
But Hamdok said a new, technocratic government could help improve Sudan's economy, which has suffered a prolonged crisis involving one of the world's highest rates of inflation and shortages of basic goods.
It could also work towards completing a peace deal signed with some rebel groups last year to end years of internal conflict, Hamdok said.
""Implementing the Juba agreement and completing the peace processes with groups that did not sign the Juba agreement are at the top of the new government's agenda,"" he said.
After the deal between the military and Hamdok was announced on Sunday, protesters who had previously championed Hamdok began shouting slogans against him. Hamdok said he signed it to prevent further bloodshed.
""We are committed to the democratic path, freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and greater opening to the world,"" he said on Monday.",0

844,"BUDAPEST, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The United Nations' top expert on freedom of opinion and expression expressed concerns about a ""distorted media environment"" in Hungary, saying on Monday that reporting around elections due next year must be fair and impartial.
U.N. Special Rapporteur Irene Khan also told reporters during a visit to Budapest that the ""freedom of expression which political candidates have should not be abused to create a toxic environment of violence (and) hatred"".
Allies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party control large parts of Hungary's private media, while the public media largely serves as a government mouthpiece. Dozens of newspapers and broadcasters that had criticised Orban have changed hands in recent years.
His government has repeatedly denied undermining press freedom. It did not respond to emailed Reuters questions on Monday.
""I see a distorted media environment in Hungary where pluralism, diversity and independence of media is being questioned,"" Khan said.
""Therefore it is important to ensure that in the context of the elections, there is fair reporting, there is access to all the candidates on a fair and equal basis, and that public service media ... maintains an impartial approach to the different parties and candidates.""
Next year's election will be the first in which Orban has faced real competition since sweeping to power in 2010.
His nationalist party has increasingly appealed to conservative voters by rejecting western liberalism and multiculturalism, and Orban has ramped up his rhetoric this year regarding LGBT people and immigrants.
U.N. rapporteur Khan also echoed European Commission concerns that state advertising is being channelled to pro-government outlets, leading to indirect political influence over the media.
The highly skewed distribution of state funds for advertising has ""major consequences, not only for the health of the media sector but also for democratic freedoms that independent media nurture"", she said in a statement on Monday.",0

AWC would also continue its five-year investment plan of 100 billion baht ($3.04 billion), Chief Executive Wallapa Traisorat said in an interview, while noting some smaller projects had been pushed back.
Wallapa announced on Monday plans for a 3.4 billion baht ""wellness resort"" in Bangkok covering 1.28 hectares (3.16 acres) of riverfront, including hotels, branded residences and spas.
In November, AWC opened its 19th property in time to receive arrivals under Thailand’s reopening plan for vaccinated tourists.
Foreign arrivals in the past two years to Thailand plummeted to a fraction of the nearly 40 million visitors in 2019, with tourism losing $50 billion in annual revenue, an 82% plunge.
The government expects 200,000 arrivals this year and five million in 2022.
""40 million is large base with many segments ... we're targeting the luxury segment,"" Wallapa said.
""Tourist behaviour is changing - there are longer stays with a focus on well-being ... not only bringing back good memories but also feeling refreshed and healthy.""
In April last year, occupancy slumped to 1%, though it has recovered to 20% thanks to domestic demand, she said.
The company has a strategy of securing prime locations and then partnering with brands for management.
AWC is owned by tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi of Thai Beverage Pcl (TBEV.SI), one of Southeast Asia’s biggest drinks makers.

847,"JOHANNESBURG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Spiralling shipping costs and COVID-19 supply chain disruptions are accelerating a shift by South African retailers to end their heavy reliance on Asia and move to source products locally.
More than 50% of South Africa's clothing textiles, shoes, and leather products are imported, mostly from China, putting Africa's leading economy and its retailers at the mercy of forces beyond their control such as Chinese power shortages.
While the government launched a programme in 2019 offering tax incentives to source goods locally, the recent spate of problems arising out of Asia has added urgency to what had been a slow shift, four top retailers in South Africa told Reuters.
""Most furniture in South Africa is currently imported, we are looking at various options to manufacture more here, particularly at the moment when shipping costs are up 400%. So it's even more of a reason if you needed one,"" TFG (TFGJ.J) Chief Executive Anthony Thunström said in an interview.
TFG, which sources 72% of its clothes locally, said earlier this month it wants to locally manufacture 30 million pieces a year within four years, up from 11.5 million currently, and is adding furniture and jewellery to its growing local list.  read more 
Thunström said a lot of TFG's jewellery is already made in South Africa, but he wants to further increase local sourcing.
The owner of British women's wear brands Hobbs and Whistles and South Africa's @Home homeware brand wants these products to be manufactured on a quick turnaround basis to improve lead times and be competitive against global chains such as Zara, owned by Inditex (ITX.MC) and Swedish rival H&M (HMb.ST).
TFG said on Nov.11 it will spend a further 575 million rand ($37 million) over the next three to five years to build local manufacturing capability.
South African retailers are not alone in looking local as constraints expose the vulnerability of globe-spanning supply chains and low-cost manufacturing hubs which have led to an over-dependence on imports, particularly from Asia.
Italy's Benetton and Hugo Boss, have already indicated they are sourcing clothes closer to home. read more 
POWER CUT IMPACT
Norman Drieselmann, CEO of South Africa's Retailability, which owns the Edgars department store chain, said that China's power cuts have added a two week delay to clothing on top of four weeks due to COVID, ahead of the critical festive season.
Woolworths (WHLJ.J) told Reuters it expects the power cuts will impact its orders for March next year. The retailer, which sources about 30% of its fashion, beauty and home products from China, said it is making arrangements to buy more locally.
Retailers who spoke to Reuters did not share potentially competitive information about who would be producing goods for them in South Africa or exactly where in the country.
But budget clothing and electronics retailer Pepkor (PPHJ.J) did say it wants to work with existing and strategic suppliers to manufacture easy to make clothing like t-shirts and shorts and provide financial capital to buy machinery.
""We've now identified some vendors that we want to work with, now the next thing is to develop the further capacity for them,"" Pepkor CEO Leon Lourens told Reuters.
However, South Africa will not provide all the answers.
Industry has suffered in a country itself long blighted by power shortages and prone in some sectors to labour disputes, while raw materials such as fabrics are sourced by South African suppliers from Asia.
Retailability's Drieselmann said that while it is looking to grow its local vendor base by placing more orders from local manufacturers instead of abroad, it is also shifting sourcing from China to other existing offshore suppliers.
The company has ""started to engage more actively with India as an alternative, particularly from a fabric sourcing perspective,"" Drieselmann added.

848,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Tanya Primiani will host 12 people around a long Thanksgiving table in her Silver Spring, Maryland home on Thursday, a boisterous scene she looks forward to welcoming after the COVID-19 pandemic limited the size of last year's gathering.
Her parents are coming from Montreal, driving across the recently reopened U.S.-Canada border. Her sons, ages 7 and 10, have gotten their first round of COVID-19 vaccinations, and all the other guests are fully vaccinated against the virus.
""I love the craziness of cooking for a bunch of people and having all the hustle and bustle around the table and everything that goes along with that,"" said Primiani, whose holiday menu will include cornbread stuffing and butternut squash soup. ""There will be so much gratitude this year.""
Many American families are excited to bring multiple generations together again for Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas now that widely available COVID-19 vaccines have reduced the worry and risk that curtailed last year's festivities.
Approximately 59% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated against the deadly virus. Children ages 5 to 11 were approved for the vaccine earlier this month, and as of last week 2.6 million kids - or nearly 10% of those eligible - had gotten their first of two shots, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said.
Even so, the return to pre-pandemic traditions is proving complicated for some whose loved ones are choosing not to get vaccinated or do not consider COVID-19 to be a serious health threat.
Connie Perkins, her husband and their three children are skipping their usual Thanksgiving meal with relatives and taking a week-long road trip to campgrounds far from their home in Galveston County, Texas, to avoid any confrontation over vaccination status.
Everyone on her husband's side of the family is vaccinated against COVID-19, Perkins said, but none of her five-member family is because they do not believe the shots are safe.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the vaccines are safe and continue to get intensive monitoring.
""We’re not going to present the opportunity for that to even come up and make anyone uncomfortable,"" Perkins said.
Public health officials say families can gather safely indoors if all members are vaccinated. However, with COVID-19 cases still high in some places and young children either not yet eligible for the shots or fully vaccinated, they suggest precautions such as celebrating outdoors and getting rapid tests to rule out sickness ahead of the gatherings.
Children ages 4 and younger who cannot get vaccinated yet are best protected if they are surrounded by vaccinated people, top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci has said.
Joseph Kyle, a public school history teacher, said he's requiring his vaccinated extended family members to take COVID-19 tests before attending the Thanksgiving meal at his home in Maplewood, New Jersey, because his 10-year-old daughter Penelope doesn't get her second shot until the next day.
""To be extra cautious, we will insist that everyone be tested in advance of the holiday dinner,"" Kyle said.
Penelope said she is excited to once again listen to the sometimes heated political discussions over meals with her relatives, calling last year's Thanksgiving with just her four-person family ""boring.""
""It’s more fun, more happy when there’s more people there,"" she said.
In neighboring South Orange, New Jersey, Robin Cutlip said she would attend a large family Thanksgiving gathering known for its sumptuous feast and board games even though her 10-year-old daughter has only gotten one shot so far and two nieces, ages 12 and 7, are not vaccinated.
In her view, if American life is ever to return to ""normal,"" families shouldn't exclude anyone from their holiday traditions over whether they are vaccinated or not.
""I’m of the mindset that this is here to stay,"" Cutlip said. ""We have to not be reckless, but we also have to get back to living our lives. There are always going to be people who aren’t going to get vaxxed.""",0

852,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Borrowing costs for U.S. dollars in currency derivatives markets rose on Monday to their highest levels in nearly a year, driven up by the year-end dollar funding rush and the euro's steady slide against the greenback.
Spreads on three-month euro-dollar  cross-currency basis swaps were at the widest since since December 2020 at around minus 27 basis points, implying that non-U.S. borrowers are prepared to pay that much premium to access dollar funding.
A cross-currency basis swap (CCBS) sees parties exchange interest rate payments in two different currencies and is often used by traders swapping liabilities to the desired currency.
Corporates and asset management firms generally step up dollar buying as the end of the year approaches, with portfolio rebalancing and fund transfers requiring currencies like the euro and sterling to be converted to the U.S. currency.
Spreads on yen-dollar swaps also were the widest since last December  though sterling-dollar spreads were more resilient at minus 16.5 bps, a two-week high .
""Typically we see demand for dollar funding increase towards year end, especially amongst Asian borrowers who have sizeable  dollar-denominated liabilities,"" Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX research at Credit Agricole said noting similar pressures last year and in 2019.
The dollar has strengthened of late, on back of economic data pointing to the U.S. Federal Reserve possibly tightening policy earlier and stepping up the pace of stimulus unwind.
The greenback is trading just off 16-month highs  against a basket of its rivals. Against the euro alone, it is up nearly 2.5% so far this month .
The euro's decline over the past few days may also be driving the widening spreads, one trader said.
The European Central Bank has pushed back against markets pricing a rate rise next year and those expectations have been dialled down further by the resurgence of COVID-19 cases across the continent.
Last week the ECB also increased the upper limit of cash as collateral for the euro securities lending programme to 150 billion euros from 75 billion euros, easing the demand for cash euros.
Stephen Gallo, chief European FX strategist at BMO Capital Markets, also pointed to year-end flows but cautioned that any widening of credit spreads for European borrowers in the coming month could boost dollar funding costs for banks.
""We have that as a potential scenario for the euro next year,"" Gallo said though he described that outcome as an ""outlier"".",0
853,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Britain's Bulb expects to appoint administrators shortly, it said on Monday, as it became the biggest UK energy supplier to be driven into financial difficulty by a surge in wholesale gas and electricity prices.
More than 20 energy suppliers have collapsed since the beginning of September because the regulator Ofgem's price cap prevented them passing on rising costs to customers.
London-based Bulb, which has around 1,000 employees and more than 1.7 million customers, or around 5%-6% of the market, had been in talks with multiple parties but failed to secure funding.
""The rising energy crisis ... has concerned investors who can’t go ahead while wholesale prices are so high and the price cap - designed to protect customers - currently means suppliers provide energy at a significant loss,"" Bulb said in a statement on its website.
Analysts have said the difference between what companies can charge a customer under the cap and the current cost of supplying them with power from the wholesale markets is around 400 pounds ($538) over a year.
Britain's domestic price cap rose 12%-13% from Oct. 1 but wholesale prices have risen far higher since that cap was set in August.  read more 
Bulb said its international businesses in France, Spain and Texas were separate from the UK business and would continue to trade.
Britain's government said on Monday it has agreed with Ofgem that the regulator could use its Special Administrator Regime (SAR) to ensure customers' supplies will not be disrupted and credit balances protected. 
The government could also provide grants or loans to keep the company running while a solution is found.
""The level of debt held by the company could mean it is effectively part-nationalised for a period, so the taxpayer is getting involved in the currently unrewarding business of energy supply,"" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown.
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was too early to say whether the company could remain a going concern.
""We will obviously seek to appoint the administrators who will effectively run it and provide energy through that system, but at this stage it is too early to say what the future of that provider will be going forward,"" the spokesman said.
The SAR scheme was set up for when an energy company that goes bust is too big for Ofgem to be able to find a new home for its customers using its usual processes.
The other suppliers to collapse this year, with a total of around 2 million customers combined, had fewer customers than Bulb.

Players on the ATP and women's WTA tours have regularly been accused of using bathroom breaks as tactical weapons at crucial junctures in matches.
Stefanos Tsitsipas was accused of cheating at this year's U.S. Open by Andy Murray after the Greek disappeared off court at various times during their marathon first-round match.
The third seed had a lengthy toilet break at the end of the second set, a medical time-out after the third and a near eight-minute break at the conclusion of the fourth set.
In his next match, Tsitsipas went to the locker room for more than seven minutes after losing the third set, and was jeered by the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd on his return.
Tsitsipas argued that he was not breaking any rules, which is why the ATP has decided to act, although some may feel the new guidelines still do not go far enough.
Although toilet breaks will be limited to three minutes, players will also be allowed two minutes to change their clothing.
Players will be limited to one toilet break per match and they will only be permitted at the end of a set.
Should a player spend too long in the bathroom he will be liable to time violations.
The ATP is also looking at new rules for medical timeouts by which players will only be allowed one three-minute time out per match to be taken during a changeover or a set break only.",0

856,"STOCKHOLM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Swedish medical equipment supplier Getinge (GETIb.ST) on Monday raised its financial targets for 2022-2025 as positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are felt across its business.
Getinge Chief Executive Mattias Perjos said hospitals taking on surgeries postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, infection control becoming increasingly important, and the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out would help drive sales, as well as underlying demand growth seen already before the pandemic.
""We have tried to see through all the moving parts and dust that the pandemic has stirred up and form an opinion on our end-markets,"" Perjos told Reuters.
""On average we see that growth is accelerating and our entire portfolio is gravitating towards higher-growth markets such as ECMO, sterile transfer and biopharmaceutical research and production,"" he added.
Getinge said in a statement ahead of investor presentations that it aimed to grow adjusted earnings per share by 10% annually on the back of a widening of its operating profit before amortisation margin to 21% or more by the end of the period, and annual like-for-like sales growth of 4-6%.
Getinge's previous targets were for a 10% rise in earnings per share and organic sales growth of 2-4%. In the 2018–2020 period, organic sales were up 9.9%, while earnings grew 22.4%.
In 2020, Getinge's organic sales jumped 14% due to strong demand for advanced intensive care unit ventilators and products such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines - a kind of artificial lung used in the treatment of COVID patients.
Its earnings per share roughly doubled to 14.43 crowns, while the margin increased to 19.2% from 12.5%.

Cutrale, which supplies Coca-Cola (KO.N) orange juice brands such as Minute Maid and Simply Orange, is looking to export from Mexico, the paper said, citing unnamed sources.
Cutrale, which usually ships about half its Brazilian orange juice exports to the United States, declined to comment on the report.
Ibiapaba Netto, director at industry group Citrus BR, said the group is trying to revert the new tax on orange juice imports, created in 2019 by an internal discussion within Brazil's internal revenue service.

860,"STOCKHOLM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Sweden's parliament will vote on Wednesday on approving Social Democrat leader Magdalena Andersson as the country's first woman prime minister, the Riksdag speaker said on Monday, amid uncertainty over whether she can cobble together enough support.
Andersson, currently finance minister, has been locked in negotiations with the Left Party to secure their backing to take over from Stefan Lofven, who handed in his resignation as prime minister earlier this month.  read more 
""Unfortunately, we have not straightened out all the details, and we have not reached a deal,"" Andersson told reporters. ""Therefore, it is not clear yet that I will be passed by the Riksdag, but the Speaker has decided to put me forward as a candidate in a prime ministerial vote.""
Andersson said negotiations with the Left Party, which wants a say in policy in return for its support, had been constructive.
""I am still hopeful that we can reach a deal,"" she said.
From 2014, Lofven led a fragile, minority coalition government with the Greens that relied on support from the Centre and Left Parties. Andersson replaced Lofven as leader of the Social Democrats earlier this month.
The Centre Party has said it will not block Andersson.  read more 
If Andersson does not get parliament's backing to become prime minister, it is unclear who can lead the country.
The head of the Moderates, the biggest opposition party, has said he does not see a way to form a centre-right government given the current political deadlock.
That could force the speaker to call a snap election, just 10 months before the country is due to hold a scheduled vote.
Without a deal with the Left it is also unclear whether the government can pass its budget, which lawmakers vote on later on Wednesday.
Parliament will vote on whether to confirm Andersson as prime minister at 0800 GMT on Wednesday. Lofven is leading a caretaker government until a new prime minister is appointed.",0
861,"MANILA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Philippine Nobel Prize winning journalist Maria Ressa ruled out on Monday going into exile over legal challenges she faces, and her lawyers urged the government of President Rodrigo Duterte to drop all charges against her.
Ressa, the first Nobel laureate from the Philippines, shared the Peace Prize with Russian investigative journalist Dmitry Muratov, a move widely seen as intended as an endorsement of free speech rights under fire worldwide.
Ressa's news site, Rappler, had its licence suspended and she has faced legal action for various reasons, motivated, supporters say, by her scrutiny of government policies, including a bloody war on drugs launched by Duterte.
""Exile is not an option,"" Ressa told a streamed news conference with her legal team, adding that she felt a climate of violence and fear under Duterte's term was easing before 2022 elections.
Free on bail as she appeals against a six-year prison sentence handed down last year for a libel conviction, Ressa is facing five tax evasion charges and a corporate case with the regulator.
""You don't know what freedom feels like until you almost lose it,"" Ressa said from the U.S. city of Boston, where she is on an academic visit.
The Philippines saw its ranking in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index drop two notches to 138 out of 180 countries, and the Committee to Protect Journalists ranks the Philippines seventh in the world in its impunity index, which tracks deaths of media members whose killers go free.
The government denies hounding media and says any problems organisations face are legal, not political. It says it believes in free speech.
Asked about Ressa's situation, the justice minister said the Philippines valued democracy, liberty and human rights.
""All the cases being faced by Maria Ressa in our country have gone through the appropriate legal processes, and Ressa has always been afforded, and will continue to be afforded, all the rights under our law to defend herself and prove her innocence in a fair and impartial trial,"" Menardo Guevarra told Reuters.
Amal Clooney, a human rights lawyer representing Ressa, told the news conference the government needed to decide whether to ""double down on its persecution of this lone journalist"" or show that it did not fear criticism and ""once again is a beacon for liberty and democracy around the world"".
Ressa has requested government approval to travel to Norway to receive the Nobel Peace Prize on Dec. 10.",0

863,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - FTAC Emerald Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by banking and fintech entrepreneur Betsy Cohen, said on Monday it plans to raise up to $220 million through an initial public offering in the United States.
The blank-check company, known earlier as Emerald ESG Acquisition Corp, is offering 22 million units at $10 each, it said in a filing.
Cohen-backed SPACs have clinched several deals to take companies public over the past few years, including ones with boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners (PWP.O) and payments provider Payoneer (PAYO.O).
Since SPACs became Wall Street's hottest investment trend over the past 18 months, Cohen has emerged as one of the biggest names in the business of blank-check deals, alongside the likes of Chamath Palihapitiya and Michael Klein.
She will chair FTAC Emerald's board, according to Monday's filing. Cohen also has a similar role in nine other blank-check firms, five of which have completed their mergers and two have announced their deals.
Emerald ESG Sponsor, a firm managed by Cohen and a backer of FTAC Emerald, has committed to buy 890,000 units at $10 each in a private placement, the SPAC said in the filing.
SPACs are publicly traded shell companies with a pool of capital that merge with unlisted companies to take them public.
FTAC Emerald said it would target companies in sectors such as renewable energy, water sustainability, agricultural technology, shared economy software or next-generation mobility.

865,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Miner and commodity trader Glencore (GLEN.L) will put its zinc sulphide operation in Portovesme, Italy, on care and maintenance until there is ""a meaningful change in power market prices"", the company said on Monday.
The plant, which has capacity of 100,000 tonnes a year, will enter care and maintenance by the end of December at the latest.
European power prices have soared this year, mainly because of the rising price of natural gas used for power generation and heating, low renewable energy output and higher carbon prices.
""This decision has been taken due to high power prices experienced in Italy and the rest of Europe,"" Glencore said.
""As an electro-intensive industry, Portovesme is highly dependent on competitive and stable electricity prices.""
The decision, which affects about 400 direct employees, will continue to be reviewed against the backdrop of the European energy market, Glencore said.
Glencore's zinc recyling and lead production facilities at Portovesme will continue as normal.
The company produced 787,200 tonnes of zinc in Europe last year.
Global zinc production is estimated at about 14 million tonnes this year, with about half of that expected to come from China, the world's largest producer.",0
866,"MOSCOW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Russia has sent Lebanon the satellite images it has for Beirut's port before and after a huge explosion rocked it last year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said after talks with his Lebanese counterpart in Moscow on Monday.

867,"MILAN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Investors in Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) on Monday cheered a proposal by U.S. fund KKR (KKR.N) to buy Italy's debt-laden former phone monopoly for 33 billion euros ($37 billion) in what would be Europe's biggest ever private equity buyout.
The move comes as a boardroom war rages at Telecom Italia (TIM), which has been mired in crisis for years but is crucial to government efforts to expand broadband connectivity because it owns the country's main network.
KKR's offer, which is conditional on the government's backing and the outcome of a four-week analysis, values TIM at 10.8 billion euros excluding net debt of 22.5 billion - or 45.7% above Friday's closing price for ordinary shares.  read more 
The shares were 32% higher in afternoon trade at 0.4585 euros each, versus the offer's ""indicative"" price of 0.505 euros, with more than 8% of TIM's capital changing hands.  read more 
However, yields on TIM's bonds, which on Friday S&P cut further below the investment grade, spiked higher, with investors fretting about a possible further increase in debt.
Successive deals have inflated TIM's debt to a gross 30.5 billion euros, crippling a company that was a crown jewel of government assets before its ill-fated 1997 privatisation.
Private equity-backed M&A deals have reached $1 trillion globally in 2021, 53% above the all-time yearly record of $663 billion of 2007, Refinitiv data show.
KKR's offer, which the New York-based fund has described to TIM as ""friendly"", would expose the company's top investor Vivendi (VIV.PA) to a steep loss on its 24% stake, for which it spent on average 1.07 euros per share.
A person close to the French media group said Vivendi believed KKR's offer did not adequately value TIM. KKR is targetting a 51% acceptance threshold so the offer does not need Vivendi's backing.
TIM's board did not give a view on the proposal.
Vivendi has been pushing to replace TIM CEO Luigi Gubitosi, who has failed to stem a revenue haemorrhage, leading to two profit warnings in three months and an almost 40% fall in the group's market value during his three-year tenure.  read more 
Italy has special powers to block foreign bids for strategic assets, and it has said it would decide whether to use them depending on plans for TIM's fixed line business.
""The path towards a formal offer may not be certain, nor fast - but we think the offer is articulate and credible,"" HSBC said.
BROADBAND ROLLOUT
As well as protecting the jobs of 42,500 local staff, Rome wants to ensure plans for the network are in line with efforts to deploy billions of euros of European Union recovery funds to rollout ultra-fast broadband across Italy - an EU digital connectivity laggard.
KKR wants to take TIM private, which analysts say would make a restructuring easier. Its offer targets both ordinary and savings shares.
""An experienced private capital provider such as KKR might prove a better fit to support TIM's turnaround,"" UBS said.
KKR, which is working with Citi, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley on the deal, has a long track record in the sector.
In April, it set up wholesale fibre firm Open Dutch Fiber,  while in 2020 it acquired with rivals Cinven and Providence Spain's fourth-largest phone group MasMovil.
KKR would carve out TIM's fixed-line business to be run as a government-regulated asset along the model of power grid Terna (TRN.MI) or gas grid Snam (SRG.MI), sources have said.
KKR already holds a 37.5% stake in FiberCop, the unit holding TIM's last-mile network running from the street to people's homes.
Gubitosi has been trying to revive a project to merge TIM's network assets with those of rival Open Fiber, a competitor in which state investor CDP is set to gain control. CDP is also the second-biggest investor in TIM, with a 10% stake.
The single network plan has run aground under Prime Minister Mario Draghi, though a source close to the matter said the Treasury was still studying a possible merger of TIM's fixed network with Open Fiber's under CDP's control.

870,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - China's magnesium exports in October rose almost 44% from September to their highest level in 19 months, customs data showed, soothing fears of tight supply of the metal as production recovers.
China supplies around 85% of the world's magnesium - a key element in aluminium alloys used to make auto parts.
Its production, which is heavily concentrated in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, fell sharply in September amid curbs on power use by energy-intensive industries. That sent prices to record highs and led to warnings of looming shortages in Europe. 
Exports of high-purity unwrought magnesium from China totalled 24,329 tonnes last month, data released by the General Administration of Customs on Sunday showed.
That was up from an 11-month low of 16,921 tonnes in September and marked the highest monthly total since 38,319 tonnes was exported in March 2020, when China was clearing a backlog of commodity shipments after the coronavirus outbreak.
The biggest export destinations for Chinese magnesium in October were the Netherlands on 8,652 tonnes and Japan on 2,892 tonnes, a breakdown of the customs data showed.
Spot magnesium prices in China, as assessed by Asian Metal , are currently at 36,000 yuan ($5,642) per tonne, having fallen almost 43% from a record high of 63,000 yuan per tonne in late September as the power crunched began to ease and production was restored.

Uber Eats will list cannabis retailer Tokyo Smoke on its marketplace on Monday, following which customers can place orders from the Uber Eats app and then pick it up at their nearest Tokyo Smoke store, the spokesperson said.
Uber, which already delivers liquor through its Eats unit, has had its sights set on the burgeoning cannabis market for some time now. Its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told media in April the company will consider delivering cannabis when the legal coast is clear in the United States.
With more than three years into Canada's legalisation of recreational cannabis, the country is trying to fix its ailing pot market, where illegal producers still control a large share of total annual sales.
The partnership will help Canadian adults purchase safe, legal cannabis, helping combat the underground illegal market which still accounts for over 40% of all non-medical cannabis sales nationally, Uber said on Monday.

872,"GENEVA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation (WHO) must be strengthened with more funding and greater ability to investigate pandemics through a new treaty, an independent panel said on Monday, ahead of a conference of health ministers next week.
Efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic have been uneven and fragmented, marked by limited access to vaccines in low-income countries while the ""healthy and wealthy"" in rich countries get boosters, the high-level experts said in their latest review.
The panel co-chairs, former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, reiterated a call for urgent reforms. These included new financing of at least $10 billion a year for pandemic preparedness, and negotiations on a global pandemic treaty.
In May, the panel evaluated how the WHO and member countries had handled the pandemic, and said a new global response system should be set up to ensure that no future virus can cause a pandemic as devastating.  read more 
""There is progress, but it is not fast or cohesive enough to bring this pandemic to an end across the globe in the near term, or to prevent another,"" the panel said in the report.

Health ministers from WHO's 194 member states open a three-day World Health Assembly on Nov. 29 to consider negotiating a treaty aimed at preventing future pandemics. It would be only the second global public health treaty, after a 2003 accord to control tobacco use.
""Strengthening the authority and independence of the WHO and developing new legal instruments are pivotal to the package of reforms required,"" the panel said. ""WHO requires more funding and greater ability to investigate and report potential pandemics more quickly and independently.
Clark, speaking at an event organised by Chatham House in London, said it had taken just five months to negotiate two new conventions on nuclear safety after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine in 1986.
""A key message to member states meeting at WHO next week is please act. We are still in the middle of a pandemic, we can't shrug it off ... Please get on with the negotiations for the treaty,"" she said.

873,"CHICAGO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Thanksgiving feasters are paying premium prices for turkeys this year, after more farmers were cautious with production, figuring a second pandemic holiday could slash demand.
The price of frozen whole uncooked turkeys in the four weeks before Nov. 6 rose 15.6% from the same period in 2020, according to data from research firm NielsenIQ.
Fewer turkeys were produced this year, so turkey meat prices have soared at a time consumers are already grappling with rising inflation with the global supply chain stumbling into the holiday shopping season.
Last year, food companies and farmers predicted many consumers would downsize Thanksgiving because of the pandemic. This year, vaccinations eased worries for some while the fast-spreading Delta variant kept others cautious.
Turkey farmers begin considering the size of their flocks for Thanksgiving up to a year ahead of time. Since then, they have confronted skyrocketing costs of grains and soybeans eaten by the birds.
Diestel Family Ranch, which produces turkeys in Sonora, California, raised birds of about the same size for 2021 as it did for 2020, farmer Heidi Diestel said, avoiding guesses on how the pandemic would change demand. The ranch added a few extra petite birds that weigh six to 10 pounds, she said, because they can be eaten year round if not sold for the holidays.
""Trying to predict this crazy world seemed like we should leave that to others,"" Diestel said. ""We didn't really want to go there.""
Butterball, the largest U.S. turkey producer, normally surveys consumers once a year to gauge Thanksgiving plans. This year, however, it peppered customers with questions again,  after the Delta variant started spreading.
By September, it found consumers turning more cautious about larger gatherings, after showing enthusiasm in June for celebrations with extended family and friends, said Al Jansen, an executive vice president.
After about two months of declining infections, the United States has reported daily increases for the past two weeks as temperatures drop and people spend more time indoors.
""Everybody still wants to celebrate Thanksgiving,"" Jansen said. ""What altered was the type of celebration.""
Frozen inventories of hen turkeys, female birds that are normally smaller in size, and turkey breasts fell to record lows this year and were down 19% and 51% from last year by the end of September, respectively, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.
The agency said wholesale hen turkey prices in September reached about $1.44 per pound, the highest level since recordkeeping began in 2005. Supplies of bigger tom turkeys in cold storage facilities are up, according to official data.
""Smaller sizes may not be as plentiful as previous years because of all the collateral damage from the pandemic,"" Butterball's Jansen said.
U.S. farmers had already been cutting turkey production before the pandemic due to declining profits, economists said. They raised 214 million turkeys in 2021, down 4% from 2020 and down 13% from 2018.
Last year, consumers swapped out orders for whole birds for smaller turkey breasts heading into Thanksgiving amid surging COVID-19 cases. 
This year, higher food prices may also be encouraging a preference for smaller birds, said Spencer Shute, senior consultant for consultancy Proxima in Boston.
A Farm Bureau survey from Oct. 26 to Nov. 8 showed Thanksgiving dinner will cost U.S. consumers an average of 14% more this year, the biggest annual increase in 31 years.  read more

874,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - England manager Gareth Southgate has ended any speculation about his future by signing a new contract through to the end of 2024, the Football Association (FA) announced on Monday.
Since being handed the job on a full-time basis in 2016, the former England international has revitalised the nation's fortunes, taking them to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and the final of European Championship this year.
Southgate's future had been the source of some uncertainty with his much-admired work with the national team making him a candidate for some of the top club jobs.
But the new deal means he and his assistant Steve Holland will lead England to next year's 2022 World Cup finals before taking them through qualifying for Euro 2024.
""I am delighted that Steve and I have been able to extend our stay in our respective roles,"" Southgate said.
""We have a great opportunity in front of us and I know they and the fans are all excited about what this squad could achieve in future.""
Former Crystal Palace and Aston Villa player Southgate began his managerial career at Middlesbrough in 2006, having ended his playing career with them, before taking charge of England's under-21 side in 2013.
He was seen as a safe pair of hands when Sam Allardyce left his post after only 67 days, and after impressing the FA hierarchy during a short spell as interim manager, he was handed a four-year contract at the end of 2016.
From the humiliation of being knocked out by Iceland at Euro 2016 under Roy Hodgson, Southgate has since moulded England into one of the world's best teams, winning praise for his work on and off the field.
He has shown a willingness to fast-track youngsters such as Marcus Rashford, Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham into the squad while remaining fiercely loyal to players who may have struggled for form at club level.
Southgate, famed for his smart waistcoats, united the nation behind the England team at the Russia World Cup in 2018, taking them to the semi-finals where they were beaten by Croatia.
He went even closer to ending England's interminable wait for a major title this year when his side reached the delayed Euro 2020 final, losing to Italy in heartbreaking fashion on penalties after the game had finished 1-1 at Wembley.
Southgate showed great poise after the defeat following the social media racial abuse received by some of his players.
Last week Southgate's team qualified as group winners for next year's World Cup in Qatar with a 10-0 away victory against San Marino and will be one of the favourites to become world champions for the first time since 1966.",0

More than 100 people were arrested during three nights of violence, which saw police open fire at rioters in Rotterdam on Friday.  read more 
""This was pure violence disguised as protest,"" Rutte said in response to the worst disturbances since a full lockdown led to widespread disorder in January.
""There is a lot of unrest in society because we have been dealing with the misery of corona for so long. But I will never accept idiots using pure violence just because they are unhappy.""
Around 30 people were arrested on Sunday, following dozens of arrests on the previous two days, as mobs of youths set fires and threw rocks.
Black-clad groups pelted police vans with stones, and in The Hague a rock was thrown through the windshield of an ambulance trying to take a patient to hospital.
Violence began in Rotterdam on Friday night, as a protest against government plans to ban most people who have not been vaccinated from public places quickly turned violent.

Dutch health authorities on Monday reported more than 23,000 new coronavirus infections in 24 hours, the second highest number since the start of the pandemic.
Health minister Hugo de Jonge stressed the country was ""far removed"" from the worst-case scenario, where hospitals would not have enough intensive care beds for every patient that needed one.

De Agostini said it appreciated the current management of Generali and expressed esteem for Chief Executive Philippe Donnet, saying he ""stood out for his strategic vision, technical expertise and managerial thoroughness"".
Donnet, at the helm of the insurer since 2016, has come under fire from two shareholders - Italian businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio - who have criticised his M&A strategy as too timid and want Generali to grow further.
The two investors have recently upped their stakes in Generali, with Caltagirone holding almost 7.2% of the insurer and Del Vecchio just over 5.72%. A shareholder pact putting the two together with banking foundation Fondazione CRT overall holds just above 14% of Generali's shares.
But CEO Donnet can count on the support of the majority of the board and on Generali's largest shareholder, Mediobanca (MDBI.MI), with 17.2% of voting rights.
The insurer is set to hold a meeting in April next year, when Donnet's term expires and shareholders are due to vote on a new board.
De Agostini said in the statement that the first step in the disposal of its stake in Generali was the sale of over 2.2 million shares, or 0.14% of the insurer, through a derivative instrument.
It added that it would use the funds from the sale ""to pursue new investment opportunities in the near future"".",0
879,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Britain will review its COVID travel rules in January and is looking at reforming its airport slots system as part of a wider new aviation strategy, minister Robert Courts said on Monday.
Britain has lagged other European countries in lifting pandemic travel restrictions with airlines complaining that the need for day-2 coronavirus tests and complicated passenger locator forms have deterred people from travelling to and from the United Kingdom.
""We will be reviewing the policy in January. We'll be looking to see what we can do at that stage,"" Courts told the Airlines UK conference.
He said reforming the country's airport slots system remained a priority for the government and it will feature in its new aviation strategy.
Under normal rules, airlines must use 80% of their take-off and landing rights at busy airports or cede slots to competitors but the so-called ""use it or lose it"" rule was waived early in the pandemic when the crisis grounded most flights.
""Slots reform remains a priority for the government,"" Courts said. ""We are carefully considering the role of the slot system as part of our future aviation strategy.""",0

""We left with only the clothes on our backs...in a small truck like animals, like cattle,"" he said, describing the journey his and eight other families made in the vehicle from a suburb south of Hodeidah to a hastily erected camp of white tents around 80 km (50 miles) south down the Red Sea coast.

881,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Max Verstappen will have his first shot at clinching the Formula One title in Saudi Arabia in two weeks' time but Red Bull's championship leader could also see his advantage disappear entirely.
The 2021 title battle remains too close to call, with Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton closing the gap to eight points with another dominant win in Qatar on Sunday.
With two races remaining, the prospect of a winner-takes-all shootout in the final round at Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina is very much alive.
For Verstappen to clinch the title at the inaugural Saudi Grand Prix in Jeddah on Dec. 5, he must finish at least second.
But if Hamilton wins that race with a bonus point for fastest lap, and Verstappen is second, the pair will leave level on points and the Red Bull driver ahead 9-8 on race wins.
In that scenario, the title will be won by whoever finishes ahead of the other in the final race, unless they take each other out.
Should Hamilton win in Jeddah and Verstappen finish lower than second, it will be the Mercedes driver leading into the final race.
Other current title permutations all involve Verstappen finishing second in Jeddah, with or without fastest lap, but Hamilton failing to win.
A retirement for the Briton would still require Verstappen to score 18 points, a second place, to end the contest.
If Hamilton is 10th, Verstappen would need to be second with fastest lap.
Should Verstappen win, with fastest lap, it will be all over if Hamilton is no higher than sixth. Without fastest lap, Hamilton would have to be seventh or lower.
There have been plenty of ups and downs in this rollercoaster season, but the most probable outcome -- based on form to date -- is for the title race to go down to the wire.

884,"LUCKNOW, India, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Flushed with victory after Prime Minister Narendra Modi caved into demands for agricultural reform laws to be repealed, Indian farmers held a mass rally on Monday to demand minimum support prices be extended to all produce, not just rice and wheat.
The protest movement launched by farmers more than a year ago became the most serious political challenge to the government, and resulted in Modi making a surprise commitment on Friday to roll back the reforms.  read more 
Thousands gathered for the latest rally in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, where Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party will seek to hold onto power in state elections due early next year. They turned their attention to minimum support prices (MSP), which were a side issue in the agricultural reform laws.
""Our battle is only half won,"" Joginder Singh Ugrahan, a prominent farmers' leader, said in an address to about 5,000 farmers waving flags of various farmer and labour organisations.
""Ensuring that the government makes a law MSP is a big issue for all of us,"" he said. ""Our protests will end once the government passes the law on MSP.""
Currently, the government mainly buys rice and wheat at minimum support prices or guaranteed prices, but the safety net benefits barely 6% of India's millions of farmers.
In a letter addressed to Modi on Sunday, the main farmers' body said: ""Minimum Support Price, based on the comprehensive cost of production, should be made a legal entitlement of all farmers (and) for all agricultural produce . . .""
Farmers also asked in the letter for the federal government to withdraw a draft electricity bill, which they fear would lead to state governments withdrawing their right to free or subsidised power, used mainly for irrigation.
Farmers have also asked the government to drop fines and other penalties for burning their fields after harvesting to remove stalk and chaff. The smoke has become a major source of air pollution in Delhi and satellite towns bordering the crop growing northern states.",0

The election has split voters between those seeking a shake-up of its free-market model and those demanding a harder line against crime and immigration, after two years of sometimes- violent protests demanding improvements to living standards.
Chileans also voted to fill 155 lower house seats and 27 of the 50 upper house seats. Hard-right and conservative lawmakers looked set to finish with 23 seats in the Senate, and center-left and hard-left lawmakers were on course for 22 seats, with the rest going to independents.

888,"TOKYO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Japan must encourage climate-transition financing by investors as many small and medium-sized companies must reshape their business operations before becoming completely green, former Bank of Japan deputy governor Hiroshi Nakaso said on Monday.
Transition financing aims to offer funds to high-emitting companies to shift toward greener operations. A lack of consensus around the terminology has spurred criticism it could encourage high-emissions companies to continue as they are.
""I'm a little bit concerned that corporate efforts in the transition phase may not be fully appreciated, if not outright neglected in the (global) taxonomy debate"" over defining which companies are 'green' or 'brown,' said Nakaso, who chairs a body to promote Tokyo as a global financial hub.
High carbon-emitting industries, such as petroleum and chemical industries, are described as 'brown' and face pressure from investors to transition towards greener business models.
Talks over green financing have tended to take a ""binary approach between green or brown,"" without enough consideration for those in between, which, with enough funds to make the transition, can shift towards more environment-friendly business operations, he added.
""Transition finance ... must be an integral part of Tokyo's green financing initiative,"" Nakaso told an online seminar.
Japan, which aims to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050, wants to promote transition finance, given its economy's heavy reliance on high-emitting industries like shipping, chemicals and steel.
The government created guidelines on transition finance in May and is expected to provide a roadmap by March 2022 for shifting toward greener operations for industries such as steel, chemicals and utilities.",0

891,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Five members of Congress called for federal consumer-privacy legislation after a Reuters report published Friday revealed how Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has led an under-the-radar campaign to gut privacy protections in 25 states while amassing a valuable trove of personal data on American consumers.
""Amazon shamefully launched a campaign to squash privacy legislation while its devices listen to and watch our lives,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who has been involved in bipartisan negotiations on privacy legislation, wrote Friday on Twitter. ""This is now the classic Big Tech move: deploy money and armies of lobbyists to fight meaningful reforms in the shadows but claim to support them publicly.""
The revelations underscored the need for bipartisan action on stronger privacy protections, he wrote. No major federal privacy legislation has passed Congress in years because members have been deadlocked on the issue.
U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has introduced several privacy bills in recent years, said in a statement that the Reuters story showed how companies including Amazon are ""spending millions to weaken state laws,"" and hoping Congress will also water down federal legislation ""until it's worthless.""
""Congress needs to prove Amazon wrong, and pass legislation that finally stops massive corporations from abusing and exploiting our personal data,"" Wyden said.
Asked for comment, Amazon did not directly address the lawmaker criticisms of its lobbying campaign against privacy protections. The company reiterated its statement for the previous Reuters report, saying it prefers federal privacy legislation to a ""patchwork"" of state regulations. The company said it wants one federal privacy law that ""requires transparency about data practices, prohibits the sale of personal data without consent, and ensures that consumers have the right to request access to and deletion of their personal information.""
U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who chairs a key House consumer protection subcommittee that deals with privacy issues, said the Reuters revelations show how Amazon is working to block consumer privacy legislation while ""claiming to support"" such regulations.
""What they mean is that they support privacy legislation that protects their profits and their right to mine consumers' data, including voice recordings and facial scans,"" she said in a statement. ""Congress is not convinced nor are we intimidated.""
Two other lawmakers who represent areas with a significant Amazon presence - U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, and U.S. Representative Suzan DelBene, a Washington state Democrat - also said Reuters' findings showed the need for federal action to protect consumers.
""Congress will protect consumers' privacy to stop big tech companies from stealing Americans' personal information, whether these companies like it or not,"" Blackburn said in a statement.",0

893,"BUCHAREST, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Romania's centrist Liberals and the leftist Social Democrats finalised their grand coalition on Monday and the country's president nominated retired army general Nicolae Ciuca as prime minister, hoping to end a two-month long political stalemate.
Romania, one of the European Union's poorest members, has been in political paralysis since a centrist coalition government splintered in September, threatening economic recovery and efforts to cut large budget and trade deficits.
""We've been working to create this solid coalition, and this government that is able to ensure Romania's stability ... Romanians are waiting for solutions to fight the impact of pandemic and the energy crisis,"" Ciuca told reporters.
Ciuca, 54, a Liberal currently serving as caretaker defence minister, served in U.S.-led military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is expected to easily win a parliamentary vote of confidence as his coalition controls 65% of seats.
The Liberals and their junior partners, the ethnic Hungarian UDMR, and the Social Democrats (PSD) had said they would install a cabinet on Nov. 25, to fight the deadliest COVID-19 wave since the start of the pandemic.
The coalition will rotate premiers every one and a half years, with the PSD holding the powerful finance, farming, defence and transport ministries and the Liberals at the helm of key departments such as justice, energy, home and foreign affairs departments.
Coalition parties jointly control two thirds of parliament. Analysts, however, have said a political setup of centrists and leftists could find itself on a bumpy road in the months ahead, potentially due to different views on reforming the judiciary.
""The social package is the most important for us,"" PSD spokesman Radu Oprea told reporters, noting it allowed for an increase in pensions, allowances and the minimum wage.
The coalition agreed to raise pensions by 10% next year along with other measures, including hiking child benefits, which will cost an overall 13.6 billion lei ($3.1 billion).

896,"SINGAPORE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Asia's cash premiums for jet fuel edged higher on Monday, lifted by stronger buying interest in the physical market.
Cash premiums for jet fuel  rose by a cent to 12 cents per barrel to Singapore quotes, while the Dec/Jan time spread for the aviation fuel in Singapore  widened its backwardation to trade at 21 cents a barrel on Monday.
""Flight numbers in Asia outside of China have risen by almost 20% from the start of November, as Thailand and Cambodia join the growing list of countries opening their borders for vaccinated travellers, with many more targeting the year-end holidays as a chance to slowly bring back capacity,"" Energy Aspects said in a note.
""Asian flight numbers are now one-third of pre-virus levels ... giving plenty of room for further demand increases as long as case counts remain under control,"" the consultancy added.
Refining margins or cracks for jet fuel , however, slipped to $9.55 per barrel over Dubai crude during Asian trading hours on Monday, their lowest since Sept. 29. They were at $9.83 per barrel on Friday.
Although several countries have announced various degrees of reopening in recent weeks, a majority of international flights still await further easing for border restrictions to swing back to normal operations.
Traders said a steady increase in cross-border long-haul flights would be a key driver to firm up jet fuel demand in coming months.  read more

897,"FRANKFURT, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The German economy is taking ""a breather"" as a lack of goods and labour as well as new restrictions designed to fight the coronavirus pandemic put an end to its recent boom, the country's central bank said on Monday.
The Bundesbank also warned that inflation in Europe's largest economy was likely to stay well above 3% for some time and upcoming wage negotiations should deliver large increases.
Germany's economy boomed in the first half of the year as services reopened for business. But it has since slowed as its industry was hit by supply disruptions and builders found it  increasingly hard to find workers, the Bundesbank said.
This could be an ominous sign for the global economy given Germany's crucial position in global supply chains and its role as Europe's growth engine.
""The economic recovery will likely take a breather,"" the Bundesbank said in its monthly report. ""From today's standpoint, GDP could tread water in the autumn quarter of 2021.""
The Bundesbank added inflation in Germany could come in just below 6% this month before easing next year as a 2020 VAT cut and other temporary factors fall out of the calculation.
Still, the German central bank saw consumer prices growing by well more than 3% for a long time, with core inflation -- which strips out energy and food -- substantially above 2%.
While wage talks yielded only small increases in the summer, actual earnings rose as workers who had seen their hours reduced due to the pandemic could increase them again.
New contracts also came with higher salaries.
""Macroeconomic conditions also point to stronger wage increases for collective bargaining agreements to be renewed in the near future,"" the Bundesbank said.
The ECB has said that the current surge in inflation is temporary and should not be met with a tightening of its ultra-loose monetary policy, which includes a sub-zero interest rate on bank deposits and massive bond purchases.
But the Bundesbank's outgoing President Jens Weidmann contradicted the ECB' official line on Friday, warning of higher inflation expectations and wage growth.  read more ",0
898,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed while, prosecutors say, the 25-year-old Black man was on a Sunday run in a mostly white neighborhood near coastal Brunswick, Georgia, on Feb. 23, 2020.
Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35, who shot Arbery with a shotgun; and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to nine charges, including murder.
They told police they thought Arbery was running from a crime and they wanted to make a citizen's arrest. Arbery's family and their supporters say he was targeted because he was Black.
All three men are charged with the same nine counts: one count of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, one count of false imprisonment and one count of criminal intent to commit a felony.
Malice murder (one count each)
Malice murder is when a person unlawfully and with malice aforethought causes the death of another person. The decision to commit malice murder can come in a spilt second or be planned long before.
A malice murder conviction carries a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. In this case, the prosecution is not seeking the death penalty.
Felony murder (four counts each)
Felony murder occurs when someone commits a serious or inherently dangerous felony and someone else dies during the crime, even if that murder wasn't planned.
The classic example is when two people rob a bank and a teller is shot dead. Even if only one person actually shot the teller, all those involved in the crime, even if unarmed, are considered equally guilty.
It is punished in Georgia by either life in prison with parole or without parole or the death penalty.
Aggravated assault (two counts each)
Aggravated assault in Georgia is defined as being an assault with the intent to commit another crime such as murder, robbery or rape and a weapon is used. It can be punished by one year in prison to a maximum of 20 years for each count.
False imprisonment (one count each)
A person commits the offense of false imprisonment when he or she violates the personal liberty of another, illegally arrests, confines, or detains such person without legal authority. False imprisonment is punished by one to 10 years in prison.
Criminal attempt to commit a felony (one count each)
It is a substantial effort to commit a specific felony crime. It is punished by one year in prison or up to half of the maximum period of time for which he or she could have been sentenced if the crime was successful.",0
899,"VIENNA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Austria powered down public life on Monday as its fourth national COVID-19 lockdown began, making it the first western European country to reimpose the drastic and unpopular measure this autumn in the face of surging coronavirus infections.
The lockdown is the first introduced since vaccines became widely available. Most places people gather, like restaurants and bars, cannot open their doors for 10 days initially and maybe as many as 20, the government says.
Christmas markets, a big draw for tourists that had only just begun to open, also shut but, in a last-minute change, ski lifts remained open to the vaccinated. Hotels, however, closed to tourists not already staying there when the lockdown began.
""I'm really tired of these lockdowns. I've just had enough,"" a 42-year-old lawyer who gave her name only as Irena said on her way to work in central Vienna.
Asked whether a lockdown could have been avoided, she said: ""If you look at other countries, I think so... The political leadership definitely failed on all levels.""
Vienna's streets were quieter than usual on a chilly, overcast Monday as many shops stayed shut but people went to work. The government is urging people to work from home where possible.
Around 40,000 people, many of them supporters of the far-right Freedom Party, protested in the city against coronavirus restrictions on Saturday. The protests were largely peaceful and the police made six arrests, in contrast to weekend clashes in Brussels and across the Netherlands.
As the working week resumed, the mood was more resigned than defiant.
""It's like a luxury prison. It's definitely limited freedom and for me it's not great psychologically,"" said Sascha Iamkovyi, a 43-year-old entrepreneur in the food sector.
""People were promised (by the government) that if they got vaccinated they would be able to lead a normal life but now that's not true.""
SLEDGEHAMMER
Roughly 66% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe. Many Austrians are sceptical about vaccinations, a view encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third-biggest in parliament.The government imposed a lockdown on the unvaccinated last week but daily infections kept rising far above the previous peak reached a year ago and intensive care beds are running short.
On Friday, the conservative-led government said it was reimposing a full lockdown and would make it compulsory to get vaccinated as of Feb. 1, a step few countries have taken.
""It is a situation where we have to react now,"" Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein told ORF TV on Sunday night.
""A lockdown, a relatively tough method, a sledgehammer, is the only option to reduce the numbers (of infections) here.""

901,"MOSCOW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday it was alarmed by a U.S.-backed push to supply Ukraine with sophisticated weapons, but said U.S. media outlets that have suggested Russia is poised to attack Ukraine are being used in a disinformation campaign.
The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Kyrylo Budanov said such an attack would probably involve air strikes, artillery and armoured attacks followed by airborne assaults in the east, amphibious assaults in Odessa and Mariupol, and a smaller incursion through Belarus.  read more 
Similar warnings, often sourced to unnamed people familiar with the matter, have appeared in some U.S. media and the United States, NATO and Ukraine have raised concerns about Russian troops movements near Ukraine in recent weeks.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the idea of a possible Russian attack and said that Moscow itself was being targeted in a disinformation campaign.
""This is whipping up tension and is another attempt to present Russia as the one threatening the process of settling the situation (in eastern Ukraine)."" said Peskov.
""And of course we cannot rule out that this is cover for aggressive dreams that Kyiv may have. I mean aggressive dreams about a possible desire to solve the problem in the south-east by force.""
Ukraine's ties with Russia collapsed in 2014 after Moscow backed separatists who seized a swath of eastern Ukraine, territory that Kyiv says it wants back. Russia also annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula that same year.
Peskov accused Ukraine of what he said were provocative actions.
""Kyiv is itself building up its forces, Kyiv is being helped to build up its forces, Kyiv is being supplied with a significant amount of weapons, including modern high-tech weapons,"" Peskov told reporters.
""And we are observing this with great alarm, knowing the significant influence of extreme-minded politicians in Ukraine,"" he said.
Ukraine says it is upgrading its combat capabilities to defend itself against new possible Russian aggression.
Moscow has long opposed the idea of Ukraine joining the NATO alliance and has recently voiced increasingly emphatic concerns over the Western military alliance's expanding ties with Ukraine.
""Of course, the number of provocations is growing and growing significantly. What's more these provocations are being carried out with weapons being supplied by NATO countries,"" said Peskov.",0
902,"ADDIS ABABA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - After a century and a half hidden in private collections, 13 stolen Ethiopian artefacts have finally returned home following months of negotiations.
""Our country's ancient civilization's history, artefacts, fingerprints of indigenous knowledge, culture ... have been looted in war and smuggled out illegally,"" said Ethiopia's tourism minister, Nasise Challa.
The items, which include an intricately latticed processional cross, a richly coloured triptych depicting Jesus' crucifixion, and an ornate red and brass imperial shield, are part of the largest act of restitution in Ethiopia's history, officials said.
These artefacts were taken in 1868 after the battle of Maqdala between the British and Ethiopian empires. Some of the objects had been offered in an auction in Britain in June by a private seller descended from a British soldier who fought in Maqdala.
""There are many artefacts that were looted from Maqdala,"" said Teferi Meles, Ethiopia's ambassador to the United Kingdom, where many of the treasures were. ""We couldn’t manage to bring back all of them, but this is the first time in the country’s history to bring back looted artefacts in this quantity.""
Several of the objects were acquired by The Scheherazade Foundation, a cultural nonprofit, and handed to the Ethiopian embassy in September. They were returned to Addis Ababa this weekend and will go on display in Ethiopian museums. But the work is far from over, officials said.
""We have started negotiations with the British Museum to bring back 12 tabots,"" said Teferi.
Tabots are replicas of the Ark of the Covenant that are sacred in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, one of the world's oldest churches. The tabots were also taken after the Battle of Maqdala.
""We believe we will be successful in bringing them back and the negotiations will continue, with other artefacts abroad,"" Teferi said.
The British Museum said it held ""cordial discussions"" with an Ethiopian delegation in September and noted ""The Museum has long-standing and friendly relations with the National Museum in Addis Ababa and with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in London and in Ethiopia.""
British museums have long resisted campaigns for the return of artworks, often citing legislation that bans them from disposing of their collections.
But the debate has heated up and British Museum said last year it would loan some works from Nigeria to a new museum there due to open in 2023.
""At this moment, it is clear that our treasures are being destroyed; it is obvious our treasures are being looted and smuggled out of the country illegally,"" said Teferi, without offering detail.
Ethiopia has been mired in conflict for over a year, with the federal government fighting the Tigray People's Liberation Front and cultural artefacts are believed to have been damaged in the fighting.
""If there is no treasure, it means there is no history; if there is no history, there is no nation,"" Teferi said.",0

BUYING THE COVID DIP? (1043 GMT)
Looking at price action this morning, it seems like dip buyers are already at work scouting for stocks that may have been excessively penalised by the COVID-19 scare that rocked markets last week.
So while the euro , European debt and travel stocks (.SXTP) are still under pressure, signalling that concerns over a winter wave of infections have not entirely dissipated, other sectors like banks and energy are trying to shake off those worries.
Indeed, some stay-at-home names like Deliveroo are heading south after Friday's bounce, indicating perhaps that COVID-19 risks fuelled gains may be overexaggerated.
""A number of Western European countries have recently tightened mobility restrictions and it is likely that we will be getting more news on this front over the coming weeks,"" say strategists at JP Morgan.

According to strategists at the U.S. bank, people mobility fell 40-50% last year, while this time it is down just 6% from highs. And vaccines have significantly reduced hospitalizations.
JP Morgan is keeping its constructive stance on stocks, ""looking to use any dips to add"".

CROWD BEHAVIOUR (0950 GMT)
The most popular hedge fund trades have suffered a record streak of underperformance this year compared to the broader market, according to an Goldman Sachs analysis of 799 hedge funds holding $2.9 trillion of gross equity positions at the start of the fourth quarter.
The U.S. investment bank's Hedge Fund VIP list of the most popular hedge fund long positions has lagged the S&P 500 (.SPX) by 16 percentage points as weakness of China ADRs weighed on long portfolios earlier in 2021 while several popular growth stocks underperformed.
The underperformance has forced hedge funds to reshuffle their positions with Microsoft now ranking as the top stock in its VIP list, unseating Facebook while at a factor level, funds are more tilted towards value relative to growth.
U.S. equity hedge funds have returned 13% YTD but just 3% during the past 6 months, according to Goldman Sachs.
The underperformance comes at a time when short interest for the median S&P 500 stock declined from 2.2% of market capitalisation at the start of 2020 to 1.5% at the start of 2021 and has remained roughly stable since.
This matches the degree of short interest during the Tech Bubble in 2000 as the lowest in at least 25 years. Short interest in every sector ranks below the 25-year average.

LOCKDOWN TRADING (0740 GMT)
Markets have suddenly woken up to COVID-19 risks, and after Austria imposed 10-days of nationwide restrictions to fight the winter virus wave, investors swiftly shifted to lockdown trading mode.
Oil hit 7-week lows in Asia hours, and equities in Europe look set for a muted start after clocking on Friday their first weekly decline in seven weeks, as bond yields and banking stocks tanked. The euro is also under pressure at 16-month lows.
Concerns are that Germany and other countries could follow suit, forcing million of people to stay at home, hitting tourism-dependent economies and outdoor businesses just before key Christmas holidays and spending.
Little wonder then that Italian and Spanish stocks look particularly vulnerable at this stage, while Big Tech and online economy names are once again in favour, sending Nasdaq futures to new record highs overnight.
Shares in vaccine makers meantime could also benefit.    German politicians are debating making COVID-19 vaccinations compulsory, and other countries are also pondering what to do with  the unvaccinated.
On the corporate front, eyes are on Telecom Italia after KKR made a $12 billion approach to take the Italian phone group private. Ericsson is also on the watch-list after the equipment maker agreed to buy cloud communications firm Vonage for $6.2 billion.

905,"HONG KONG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Even as they chase a record fourth continental title, Pohang Steelers go into Tuesday's Asian Champions League final against Al Hilal as underdogs, leaving defender Alex Grant relishing being written off once more.
The South Korean side have already overcome the odds and disappointing domestic form to reach the decider, where they face an Al Hilal side heavily favoured to win a fourth title of their own.
Former Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim leads a team packed with Saudi Arabia internationals and which features talent of the calibre of Bafetimbi Gomis, Andre Carillo and Matheus Pereira.
Playing the final at home in front of a 60,000 crowd at the King Fahd International Stadium will give the Saudis a boost as they look to add the trophy to their Asian titles won in 1991, 2000 and 2019.
But, rather than be overawed, Grant is looking forward to the task that lies ahead.
""We'll lap it up,"" says the England-born defender. ""What an experience.
""If we win we'll deserve it - but to sweep it from under their grasp would be great. I can't wait, just to play in front of a packed stadium.""
The pandemic has had a major impact on the competition as organisers altered the format, forcing many matches to be played in centralised venues and behind closed doors.
Pohang, though, have shown a resilience that helped them squeeze into the knockout rounds as one of the best second-placed teams from the group phase before they handed Japan's Cerezo Osaka a defeat in the last 16.
They eliminated another Japanese side, Nagoya Grampus, before Grant's late header took their semi-final against holders and fellow South Koreans Ulsan Hyundai into extra-time.
Pohang won that game on penalties and stand one game away from securing a fourth title after successes in 1997, 1998 and 2009.
""We've probably been underestimated, I'd say, by the other teams and have gone into every round as the underdogs, beginning with Cerezo Osaka,"" Grant says.
""And that's played into our hands massively. Nagoya beat us in the group stage and there was probably a slight lack of respect from them.
""Ulsan probably looked at our position in the league and our form going into the game and underestimated us slightly. But if you look at the performance we put in, it was immense.
""The boys played really good football and we deserve to be in the final the way we've played and the way we've held ourselves.""",0

907,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - KKR (KKR.N) is offering weary investors an exit from the Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) soap opera. The U.S. buyout group wants to take the phone operator private for 10.8 billion euros, ending years of wrangling between investors, board members and politicians. Though its opening bid is opportunistically below Telecom Italia’s pre-pandemic value, the 47% premium to last Friday’s closing price should appeal to all but top investor Vivendi (VIV.PA). The board should at least take KKR’s call.
The buyout firm’s provisional offer for the former state monopoly is just the latest example of private equity barons raiding Europe’s depressed telecoms sector. KKR led a successful 3 billion euro assault on Spain’s MasMovil 18 months ago. Telecom Italia is on a different scale, though. Factoring in 26 billion euros of net debt, KKR is valuing the enterprise at nearly 37 billion euros.
That debt, equivalent to roughly 4 times the EBITDA analysts expect the company to generate next year, means KKR can’t use the typical ploy of adding leverage. A more plausible plan would be to unlock value via a breakup. The buyout firm last year bought 37.5% of FiberCop, which operates Telecom Italia’s broadband network, in a deal that valued the business at 7.7 billion euros. Offloading Telecom Italia’s 30% stake in 10 billion euro tower operator Inwit (INWT.MI) would help reduce debt, as would flogging its domestic telecoms services business.
KKR must first convince Chair Salvatore Rossi and the rest of Telecom Italia’s board that the offer is worth considering. Its bid of 50.5 euro cents per share in cash is slightly below where the shares were trading in mid-February last year, before Covid-19 struck. A valuation of 5.7 times next year’s EBITDA is also less than the 8 times that KKR paid for MasMovil.
Vivendi’s lack of enthusiasm is understandable: the French media group paid around 1.07 euros per share for its 24% stake. Telecom Italia shares were trading 12% below KKR’s bid on Monday morning, suggesting scepticism about the offer going ahead.
But the Italian government, which has the power to block an unwanted takeover, is making encouraging noises. With the board divided over strategy, the future for other shareholders looks dismal. Accepting KKR’s opening offer would be a mistake. Rejecting it out of hand would be an even bigger one.

The past 10 months have been the toughest of Zango's nearly 50-year career as his city of 800,000 struggles without power from the national grid.
""Every aspect of life - everything - has changed in Maiduguri,"" Zango, 66, said. ""If we were getting 10 naira profit (per unit before), profits have now fallen to 2 or 3 naira.""
Maiduguri is the capital of Borno state, the epicentre of Nigeria's 12-year battle against Islamist militants who in January bombed transmission lines, cutting the city's power and stifling efforts to rebuild its economy.
""You have a city that is trying to recover...This has now thrown a spanner in the works,"" Institute for Security Studies researcher Teniola Tayo said.
EXPLOSIVE AND EXPENSIVE
Electricity access is a problem across Nigeria due to poor infrastructure despite the oil wealth that makes it Africa's biggest energy producer, but virtually all cities have at least intermittent grid power. Maiduguri residents told Reuters they had never gone without it for so long until now.
Workers immediately fixed the transmission lines, but militants destroyed them within 48 hours. In February, a repair vehicle hit an improvised explosive device, killing one soldier and injuring three workers.
The destruction left residents sweltering indoors and reliant on expensive, polluting diesel generators to do business.
Zango said grid power cost around 30,000 naira ($73.09) a month, while diesel costs 9,000 naira every day.
Borno state police commissioner Abdu Umar said officers had removed explosive devices from roads to help improve security, which would enable repairs. ""There is nothing that will deter us from securing lives and properties,"" he said.
Nigerian oil company NNPC pledged in August to build a 50 megawatt, gas-fired power plant in Maiduguri to cut its reliance on transmission lines. But the timeline for both the plant and transmission line repairs remains unclear.
BROADER ECONOMY SUFFERING
Even where demand thrives, some businesses flounder.
Ice seller Ahmed Yusuf can only run four of his 40 freezers and had to cut his 300 employees to 50 amid a near-doubling in diesel costs. ""We have collapsed financially,"" he said.
The problem is stifling Maiduguri's economy, which itself is key to the broader economy surrounding Lake Chad, which straddles the Nigerian-Chadian border.
Tayo warned that citizens who cannot make a living legitimately are more easily lured into selling information or supporting militants who roam just outside Maiduguri.
""If there are not sufficient ways to earn an income, those kinds of actions will be more attractive,"" she said.
At his printing press, Zango is determined to continue. But with rising fuel prices, it's getting tougher. ""A lot of my money goes to fuel,"" he said. ""It can't continue.""

The Robert Koch Institute reported on Monday that the 7-day infection count rose to 386.5 per 100,000 citizens, or 30,643 in total over 24 hours, 7,000 more than a week ago. More than 60 people died of the virus in the past 24 hours.
Germany's 16 states, whose remit includes public health, are trying to break the wave by rolling out booster shots, appealing to the unvaccinated to take the shot, and imposing a patch-work of restrictions.
The eastern state of Saxony and the southern state of Bavaria have cancelled Christmas markets which were set to open this week. Across Germany, most businesses remain open to those who are either vaccinated or recovered as authorities try to break resistance to getting a shot in a country where the vaccination rate stands at 68%, compared to almost 80% in Spain.
Spahn said that booster shots would take at least two weeks to start flattening the curve of infections and said only contact restrictions could help in the shorter term.
Spahn sought to allay concerns of vaccine shortages as Germany has a combined 50 million doses from BioNTech and Moderna available until the end of the year, enough for first and second shots as well as boosters.",0
911,"SOFIA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The United States has expressed deep concern over comments by Bulgarian President Rumen Radev that the Crimean Peninsula  annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 is ""Russian"", the U.S. embassy in Sofia said on Monday.
Radev, who won a second presidential term in a runoff in the European Union country on Sunday, has pledged to keep close ties with Bulgaria's NATO allies, but has also called for a pragmatic relationship with Russia.
In a presidential debate prior to his re-election, Radev  referred to Crimea as ""currently Russian"" and called on Brussels to restore dialogue with Russia, arguing that Western sanctions against Moscow were not working.
""The United States is deeply concerned by the recent statements of Bulgarian President Rumen Radev in which he referred to Crimea as ""Russian,"" the embassy said in a statement.
""The United States, G7, European Union, and NATO have all been clear and united in our position that, despite Russia's attempted annexation and ongoing occupation, Crimea is Ukraine"".
Radev's comments on Crimea have prompted protests from Ukraine and strong criticism from his opponents at home.
Russian-backed separatists seized a swath of eastern Ukraine in 2014, the same year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula.
Tensions between Kyiv and Moscow are high following warnings from Kyiv and Washington of what they say is unusual Russian military activity near the Russia-Ukraine border. Saying such suggestions are inflammatory, Moscow has complained of increasing activity in the region by the NATO alliance.
Radev's supporters have said that the president, who has also said that Crimea's annexation was in breach of international laws, only meant to appease Russophile voters in the Balkan country ahead of the presidential election.
Bulgaria was one of the closest allies of the Soviet Union during the Communist era. It maintains close cultural, historical and economic ties with Russia, which remains the country's main energy partner.",0
912,"SANGLI, India, Nov 22 (Reuters) - For eight straight days, household goods salesman Vipresh Shah has failed to sell a single pack of Dettol soap to the storekeepers who have been buying from him ever since he took over his family business as a teenager, 14 years ago.
Shah is an official distributor for Britain's Reckitt Benckiser in Vita, near Sangli city, around 200 miles south of Mumbai. But he said once-loyal customers now point to an app - JioMart Partner - on their smartphones showing prices up to 15% lower, instead of placing orders.
""As Reckitt's distributor, I used to be like a prince in the market,"" said Shah. ""Now the buyer tells me, 'See how much you've been ripping us off!'""
The 31-year-old said he lost $2,000 of his own money as he discounted products to match prices on JioMart, the app rolled out by Reliance Industries billionaire Mukesh Ambani in his drive to revolutionise retail distribution in India.
Up and down India in places like small town Vita, the mom-and-pop stores that account for four-fifths of a near-$900 billion retail market - more than $700 billion - are increasingly turning to JioMart to stock up on foreign and domestic brands.
Just as Ambani, India's richest man, has disrupted the country's telecoms industry, the tycoon is intent on shaking up retail distribution, taking on U.S. e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN.O) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N), expanding fast in India.
The country has around 450,000 traditional distributors, who have legions of salespeople to service every corner of the vast nation, including 600,000 villages. They typically earn a margin of 3-5% on product prices and mostly take orders physically once a week, making deliveries to retailers within a couple of days.
But Reliance's model throws a wrench in that supply chain: the mom-and-pop stores, known as 'kiranas', can order goods on JioMart Partner with deliveries promised within 24 hours. Reliance also offers training on ordering, credit facilities and free product samples for affiliated kiranas' customers.
That means hundreds of thousands of salesmen representing consumer giants like Reckitt, Unilever (ULVR.L) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), face an existential threat to their business, according to interviews with salespeople, 20 distributors and a trader group with members across India.
Many of the distributors contacted by Reuters said they have slashed their workforce or vehicle fleet, seeing their sales from door-to-door agents drop 20-25% in the last year as shopkeepers partner with Reliance.
In Vita, salesman Shah said he has had to lay off half of his staff of four. He fears the 50-year-old family firm might not last beyond the next six months.
'GUERRILLA TACTICS'
The scale and speed of the disruption have triggered tensions between traditional distributors and Reliance that have boiled over into physical confrontation in some cases.
In Maharashtra state in the west - home to Vita - and Tamil Nadu in south, traditional salesmen have organised blockades of some JioMart delivery vehicles.
""We will employ guerrilla tactics,"" said Dhairyashil Patil, president of the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation, which represents 400,000 agents of local and foreign consumer firms. ""We will continue to agitate,"" he told Reuters, ""we want (consumer goods) companies to realise our value.""
Reliance remains undeterred in pushing ahead with Ambani's ""new commerce"" retail venture, first announced in 2018.
Last year it raised funds from marquee investors including Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co Inc (KKR.N) as it seeks to integrate mom-and-pop stores in what it has touted as a more inclusive approach to digital commerce. That push is widely seen countering the likes of Amazon, which have for years faced - and denied - claims in India of favouring select big sellers at the expense of smaller retailers.
A source close to Reliance said the company was determined to keep expanding its business for mom-and-pop stores. It believes its model can co-exist alongside the traditional approach in one of the world's biggest retail markets, the person said, declining to be identified because of lack of authority to disclose company plans.
Ambani in 2018 said he eventually wanted to connect 30 million small merchants to the Reliance network. So far, it has 300,000 merchant partners in 150 cities who order consumer goods from Reliance, but the transformation will be magnified many times over if it meets a target of adding 10 million partner stores by 2024.
Reliance did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Colgate declined to comment, while Reckitt said its customers and distributors were an integral part of its business but it does not comment on its relationship with them. Unilever's India arm, Hindustan Unilever, (HLL.NS) did not respond to a request for comment.
WHICH CHANNEL?
The traditional distribution methods remain important to the consumer goods makers, even amid the disruption, industry watchers say.
Himanshu Bajaj, former Asia consumer and retail head at consulting firm Kearney, said CEOs of consumer firms he met in September raised concerns about Reliance's strategy upsetting the traditional distribution chain.
""The companies don't want to kill their own distributors. The worry is real,"" he said.
Asked about Reliance's model and concerns among distributors, Sunil D'Souza, CEO of India's Tata Consumer Products (TACN.NS), told Reuters in an interview last month it ""can't afford to sit back and ignore"" any major distribution channel, but Tata was trying to minimise conflict and strike a balance.
Jefferies in March estimated kiranas will ""steadily increase the share of procurement"" from Reliance ""at the cost of traditional distributors"". Such sales for Reliance could mushroom to $10.4 billion by 2025 from just $200 million in 2021-22, Jefferies estimates.
One executive who works for a rival to Reliance said Ambani ""was spreading his wings very fast"" in servicing kiranas and already has an edge on negotiating prices, due to long-standing relationships with consumer good makers which have for years counted Reliance and its 1,100 supermarkets as a big client.
With kirana partners, Ambani is adding another, major vertical. ""Brands cannot afford to sideline Reliance, it's just their sheer purchasing power,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified as he wasn't authorised to speak with media.
ALL ABOUT PRICING
Many kiranas are cramped shops in ageing buildings, where branded products are placed on wooden shelves and small sachets dangle from the ceiling. Such retailers are embracing Reliance as a means to boost profit margins.
When Reuters accompanied Anuruddh Mishra, a sales agent for Colgate, during a field trip in Mumbai's Dharavi area, he struggled to convince Shivkumar Singh, the 50-year-old owner of a dilapidated store, to make purchases. Dharavi is home to 1 million people and rated one of the world's biggest slums.
Singh opened his JioMart app and showed the far lower prices on offer. ""How can I order from traditional distributors?"" he said. ""The difference in price is huge. Now I order mostly from Reliance.""
A Reuters review of purchase deals on the JioMart Partner app showed the Dharavi retailer could bulk buy a two-tube combo of Colgate MaxFresh toothpaste for about 115 rupees ($1.55). Salesman Mishra's distribution company gets it for 145 rupees, and his last offer to the Dharavi retailer was 154 rupees - still more than a third higher than the Reliance price.
Back in Sangli, traditional distributors said they have at times chased down Reliance vehicles and confronted drivers, alleging unauthorised deliveries.
Sunil Pujari, who works in the city for one JioMart delivery agent, said he had been warned by his supervisors to immediately alert them if angry distributors stopped vehicles.
But business remains brisk.
""Prices offered by JioMart cannot be matched by anyone,"" he said, making another delivery in a crowded market.",0
913,"BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - China is urging some local governments to embark on pilot programmes next year to improve medical and care services for the elderly, with the goal of rolling out the scheme nationwide in 2023.
Of the 31 provinces, regions and municipalities in mainland China, 15 should launch their local pilot schemes for better medical and care services for the elderly next year, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement on Monday.
China has been mobilising resources to ensure that more vulnerable age groups are taken care of as society ages. In 2020, citizens aged 65 and above accounted for 13.5% of the Chinese population, compared to 8.87% registered in 2010.  read more 
A diminishing pool of working adults will also hamper China's ability to provide and pay for high-quality services for older people.
The pilot programmes should aim to increase the number of medical facilities that cater for the elderly, for example by guiding some hospitals to transform themselves into care centres or supporting non-government organisations in setting up large-scale chains of care centres, the NHC said.
The pilots should also boost the number of medical professionals specialising in elderly care, provide at-home visits for old people with mobility issues, and improve the pricing system for medical and care services as well as how they can be paid for.
By 2023, there ought to be feasible experience from those pilots ready for nationwide adoption, the NHC said.",0
914,"BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - China's cabinet said in Monday it would step up financing support for small businesses hurt by soaring raw material prices, power shortages and recent COVID-19 outbreaks.
Chinese authorities have unveiled a raft of policy measures since early last year to support small businesses, which are vital for growth and jobs but which have been hit harder by the COVID-19 outbreak.
""Recently, costs of small- and medium-sized enterprises have risen and difficulties in their operations have intensified,"" the cabinet said, pointing to rising raw material prices, weak orders, high logistics costs and power cuts.
Local authorities would provide relief funds for small firms that temporarily face difficulties but have long-term market potential, promising projects and competitive technology, alongside tax breaks for some firms, it said.
The central bank would step up credit support for small firms, making good use of the annual relending quotas, it said.
China would boost financing support for small firms by increasing annual relending quotas by 300 billion yuan ($47 billion), the cabinet said in September.

The pre-trial detention of the three members of Cambodia's disbanded opposition party comes amid a broad crackdown that started in the run up to a 2018 general election and has been condemned by the United Nations and the West.
Veourn Veasna and Voeung Samnang were registered refugees under U.N. protection and returned earlier this month. Thavry Lanh, a former commune chief, was sent back to Cambodia on Saturday, according to Human Rights Watch.

The bureau's spokesman Achayon Kraithong said Thailand would prioritise immigration law but avoid sending people into danger
Cambodian police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun said the three jailed activists had violated immigration law in Thailand and Cambodia had not sought their deportation.

It said enhanced lockdowns and travel restrictions in Malaysia and Indonesia impacted its aviation revenue, although its Philippines unit had a strong quarter.
The group said in bourse filings it recorded a net loss of 887 million ringgit ($212 million) for the July-September quarter, 4.1% more compared with a loss of 851.8 million ringgit a year earlier.
Revenue for the period dropped 37% to 295.9 million ringgit. However, its logistics business Teleport tripled its revenue, contributing 53% to the group total revenue.

The group said investments in technology, talent and network for its digital businesses and in Teleport also added to its losses.

The most popular hedge fund trades have suffered a record streak of underperformance this year compared to the broader market, according to an Goldman Sachs analysis of 799 hedge funds holding $2.9 trillion of gross equity positions at the start of the fourth quarter.
The U.S. investment bank's Hedge Fund VIP list of the most popular hedge fund long positions has lagged the S&P 500 (.SPX) by 16 percentage points as weakness of China ADRs weighed on long portfolios earlier in 2021 while several popular growth stocks underperformed.
The underperformance has forced hedge funds to reshuffle their positions with Microsoft now ranking as the top stock in its VIP list, unseating Facebook while at a factor level, funds are more tilted towards value relative to growth.
U.S. equity hedge funds have returned 13% YTD but just 3% during the past 6 months, according to Goldman Sachs.
The underperformance comes at a time when short interest for the median S&P 500 stock declined from 2.2% of market capitalisation at the start of 2020 to 1.5% at the start of 2021 and has remained roughly stable since.
This matches the degree of short interest during the Tech Bubble in 2000 as the lowest in at least 25 years. Short interest in every sector ranks below the 25-year average.

924,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Sudan's military has announced a deal to reinstate Abdalla Hamdok as prime minister, just under a month after dissolving his government in a coup.
The agreement faces opposition from protesters who previously saw Hamdok as a symbol of resistance to military rule but viewed his signature of the deal as a betrayal.
WHAT'S IN THE AGREEMENT?
The agreement signed on Sunday says Hamdok will lead a government of technocrats during a political transition expected to last until 2023, and that all political detainees are to be freed.
It is meant to be based on an earlier deal struck between the military and civilian political forces in the wake of the overthrow of Omar al-Bashir in 2019, under which they agreed to share power until elections - though that partnership was halted by the coup.
It provides for the investigation of casualties during recent demonstrations, and for the completion of a peace process signed by some Sudanese rebel groups in Juba last year.
WHAT'S CHANGED?
The military says its takeover was a ""correction"" to move beyond political infighting, and that the transition towards elections can now continue.
Opponents argue the agreement provides legal cover for the coup and allows the military to bolster its position by replacing democrats with loyalists in positions of authority, thereby subverting the transition and the goals of the 2019 uprising that toppled Bashir.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
Sudan's power sharing arrangement had come under increasing strain as civilians pressed for reform of the military, justice for protesters killed in 2019, and the delivery of Bashir and others wanted over crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.
The military accused political factions of incitement against the army, while civilian groups said the military was manoeuvring to grab power. On Oct. 25 it did so, arresting its most prominent critics and placing Hamdok under house arrest.
Much of the international community condemned the coup and pro-democracy groups in Sudan began a campaign of mass rallies and civil disobedience. Local mediation efforts backed by the United Nations sought a return to power sharing as the military moved to consolidate its position.
HOW MUCH SUPPORT DOES THE DEAL HAVE?
Hamdok, who had resisted military pressure to dissolve his government immediately before the coup, said he signed the deal in order to prevent further bloodshed after a crackdown left several dozen protesters dead.
The military has the support of some former rebel factions that signed the Juba peace deal and social leaders prominent under Bashir. The United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union and Western states cautiously welcomed the agreement.
However, the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) political coalition that had been sharing power with the military, as well as pro-democracy activists who have led protests since the 2019 uprising, have rejected it.
Angered by the coup and protester deaths, they are demanding that the military exit politics and be held to account in the courts, raising the prospect of continued demonstrations.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
The fate of the deal will determine the balance of power in Sudan, a country of 46 million people in which a popular uprising had carved a way out from decades of autocracy, internal conflict and economic isolation under Bashir.
Hamdok's government had secured agreement for relief on more than $56 billion in foreign debt - a step thrown into doubt by the coup. It had carried out painful economic reforms that it said were starting to bear fruit against a backdrop of shortages and widespread poverty.
It had also agreed to take steps to follow other Arab states in normalising ties with Israel.
Sudan's course will have a bearing on a volatile region bordering the Sahel, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa where international powers are vying for influence. The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region sent tens of thousands of refugees into Sudan one year ago, and renewed tensions over farmlands on the neighbours' disputed border.",0

926,"ORLANDO, Fla., Nov 22 (Reuters) - Amid all the confusion over the Bank of England's botched guidance on when it will start raising interest rates, one clear pattern has emerged: Hedge funds are dumping sterling.
Funds are the most bearish on the pound since June last year, according to the latest positioning data from Chicago futures markets, marking a historic U-turn since the BoE's surprise decision earlier this month to keep rates on hold.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows that hedge funds and speculators increased their net short sterling position to 31,599 contracts in the week to Nov. 16 from 12,093 the week before.
That's essentially a $2.65 billion bet on the pound falling. Just two weeks before, funds were net long more than 15,000 contracts, a collective $1.3 billion bet on the currency rising.
Only twice since the sterling futures contract was launched in 1988 have there been bigger two-week selloffs, in March and December of 2007.
The catalyst this time was the Bank's rate-setting committee's 7-2 vote on Nov. 4 to keep interest rates at a record low 0.10%, despite strong hints from Governor Andrew Bailey and Chief Economist Huw Pill that an inflation-fighting hike was a real possibility.
More confusingly for traders who had followed this guidance and went long sterling, Bailey and Pill were not the two dissenters calling for a rate increase. Both have since gone on a mini public relations offensive to clear up the mess.
On Friday, Pill said the weight of evidence was shifting towards a rise in rates next month but that he had not made a decision. Bailey told The Sunday Times that risks to inflation are two-sided although he worries that it could be ""elevated for longer"".  read more 
Upbeat UK labor market data last week also and helped lift the pound from a one-year low of $1.3350 back above a key chart area around $1.34.
POLICY ERROR?
Sterling could be at a turning point.
As the CFTC data show, funds are heavily short. But that positioning is only up to Nov. 16, and probably does not take into account the pound's bounce back last week. There is also a full calendar month until the BoE's next policy meeting, plenty of time for funds to build back longer.
This is more than plausible.
Annual inflation is running above target at 4.2% and may be reaching 5% next year, while signs of entrenched labor market strength are emerging. Rates market pricing is firmly pointing to only the second December rate hike in almost half a century.
On the other hand, 100 basis points of tightening is fully priced in over the next year. That's pretty aggressive, and is roughly double the Fed's expected tightening path over the same period.
Will the Bank of England really tighten policy that much? Noting fears that the Bank could be making a policy mistake, analysts at Rabobank are cautious about how far rates can be raised without endangering the economic recovery.
""A December rate hike is only likely to lead to sustainable gains for the pound if it is backed by further strong UK data releases,"" they wrote in a note last week.

Though Wall Street futures  held comfortably in positive territory in early London trading, major European indexes opened in the red as markets seem to have suddenly woken up to COVID-19 risks.
""The problem in Europe is the spread of Covid-19 which means that more lockdowns and other health restrictions partly against the non-vaccinated should rapidly increase in the next two weeks,"" said Sebastian Galy, a strategist at Societe Generale.
""That in turn should have a negative impact on some services and impact negatively growth, a scenario that had been ever more priced into the European equity market.""

928,"HONG KONG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is offering to pay some of its Hong Kong-based staff up to $5,000 each for their hotel quarantine stay for personal trips, a memo from the Wall Street bank to employees seen by Reuters showed.
The move, likely the first such announced by a financial institution in the city, comes as the Asian financial hub's COVID-19 measures, some of the strictest in the world, are said to hurt businesses.
It comes after Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, visited Hong Kong last week for 32 hours after he was given a government exemption from quarantine. 
The memo said staff at the executive director level and below would be entitled to the one-off payment for a single quarantine stay in Hong Kong.
The program will run from December 1 to November 2022 and is for staff returning from visiting immediate family members overseas, the memo said.
""We recognize that the costly quarantine measures in place in Hong Kong associated with COVID-19 have impacted many of you with respect to visiting family and loved ones overseas,"" the memo said.
A JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo, which was first reported by the South China Morning Post on Monday.
Hong Kong's current rules stipulate returning residents and visitors from most countries must spend two to three weeks in hotel quarantine paid for by themselves.
The Chinese-ruled city has registered barely any new infections in recent months but the government is keeping strict rules in place and closed borders.
Hong Kong has recorded 12,402 cases during the pandemic while the double dosed vaccination rate stands at 66.8% , according to a government website.
Tight rules have been hitting Hong Kong's largest businesses, and financial lobby groups have urged the government to consider relaxing some of the quarantine measures.

929,"LYON, France, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Ligue 1 game between Olympique Lyonnais and Olympique de Marseille was abandoned after Marseille's Dimitri Payet was hit by a bottle hurled from the stands at the Groupama Stadium on Sunday, throwing France's Ligue 1 into fresh turmoil.
Payet fell to the ground as he was getting ready to take a corner kick after five minutes, and both teams were sent to the dressing room by referee Ruddy Buquet, who then decided to abandon the match after a suspension of almost two hours.
Payet, who according to the French League (LFP) was also subject to ""discriminatory insults"", left the pitch with an ice pack on his head.
The stadium's announcer had initially said that the game would restart, following a decision made by local Lyon authorities.
This was immediately criticised by the LFP in a statement, in which the body also said it was summoning an emergency meeting of its disciplinary commission on Monday.
In chaotic scenes, Lyon players took to the pitch to warm up, but Jorge Sampaoli's Marseille stayed in the dressing room and the match was eventually called off.
""The referee believes safety conditions are not met,"" the stadium announcer said.
Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas criticised the decision to abandon the match.
""The referee first said that the game could restart and he changed his mind after the violent reaction of Marseille, notably that of their coach,"" Aulas said.
""I believe the conditions were met to resume the game after the individual had been arrested. He is in police custody.""
His Marseille counterpart Pablo Longoria said Payet was ""psychologically affected"" by the incident and explained that the club had asked Buquet to check on their players before potentially resuming the game.
""We asked him to check on our players' psychological state. He did not wish to go and see the players.""
The referee said that his ""sporting decision"" was to not restart the game, but there were other elements to take into account. ""It's a full stadium, players to evacuate,"" he said.
""My decision was to call off the game. We have to take our responsibilities and that's what I did tonight.""
Ligue 1 has been marred by crowd trouble this season.
Nice were docked two points, one of them suspended, after serious incidents during their game against Marseille, whose players clashed with home fans who pelted them with missiles and stormed onto the pitch in August. 
The northern derby between RC Lens and Lille was also hit by crowd problems in September, with the start of the second half being delayed by about half a hour after rival fans threw objects at each other before people ran on to the pitch, prompting riot police and stewards to intervene. 
There has also been crowd trouble in Montpellier, Angers, Marseille and St Etienne.
""We now have to sit down all together and discuss so that these incidents do not happen again,"" said Longoria.",0
930,"BETHLEHEM, West Bank, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The trickle of tourists is sometimes scarcely enough to fill a manger, let alone an inn, but Bethlehem's Palestinians are hopeful that numbers will rise in the month before Christmas.
The traditional birthplace of Jesus was all but shuttered by the pandemic last year, ravaging the tourism-dependent economy and leading some hoteliers to consider selling up.
But this year Israel has eased curbs on foreign tourists in time for Christmas, although everyone remains wary of a winter coronavirus wave.
While grateful for the return of some foreign tourists and Christian Palestinians from the West Bank and Israel, it is a far cry from the 3.5 million visitors who came in winter 2019, just before the pandemic.
“Of course the numbers are very few, but as a start, as a beginning, I think it’s good,” Palestinian tourism minister Rula Maayah told Reuters. “Hopefully very soon these few hundreds will be a few thousand.”
The reduced numbers have at least improved the experience for those who are there.
One of just three wise tourists standing in an otherwise-deserted Manger Square on Nov. 17, Danish pilgrim Trina Dybkjaer said their timing seemed ideal.
“I came to see where Jesus was born,"" she said, looking up at the half-decorated Christmas tree outside the Church of the Nativity.
“I can almost feel the history of how it was back then. It hasn’t been, at least today, destroyed by a lot of tourists.”
Bethlehem's municipality scaled back the town's Christmas market last year and banned most spectators from the tree-lighting ceremony.
But Mayor Anton Salman said this year's celebration will proceed as normal on Dec. 4, with visitors asked to wear masks. He expected around 15,000 people, mostly Palestinians.
Across Bethlehem, souvenir-sellers and hoteliers say they are struggling to make a living.
“We have Christmas reservations from Britain, Colombia, the U.S., all over, we can't complain about that,” said Joey Canavati, manager of Nativity Street's Alexander Hotel.
“We just don't know what will happen next week, or next month - will there be another COVID wave? Will everything shut down again?”",0

932,"BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Some Chinese banks have been told by financial regulators to issue more loans to property firms for project development, two banking sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Monday, in efforts to marginally ease liquidity strains across the industry.
Chinese authorities have yet to publicly give any signal that they will relax the ""three red lines"" - financial requirements introduced by the central bank last year that developers must meet to get new bank loans.
But lenders have recently adjusted their lending practices to reflect the latest central bank guidance of ""meeting the normal financing needs"" of the sector.  read more 
The marginal relaxation of loan policies to developers will still stick to the major principle that ""homes are for living in, not for speculation,"" said the sources, one from a city commercial bank and the other from a big bank, who received the guidance from regulators.
Financial regulators have told the banks to specifically accelerate approval of loans to develop projects, and to ensure that outstanding loans to project development show positive growth in their loan books in November compared with October, the two sources said.
Both sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As of end-September, banks' outstanding loans to project development stood at 12.16 trillion yuan ($1.91 trillion), up by 0.02% from a year earlier, central bank data showed.
Quarterly growth of this loan type slowed further from the second quarter by 2.8 percentage points, the data showed.

933,"BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told leaders of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at a summit on Monday that Beijing would not ""bully"" its smaller regional neighbours, amid rising tension over the South China Sea.
Beijing's territorial claims over the sea clash with those of several Southeast Asian nations and have raised alarm from Washington to Tokyo.
But Xi said China would never seek hegemony nor take advantage of its size to coerce smaller countries, and would work with ASEAN to eliminate ""interference"".
""China was, is, and will always be a good neighbour, good friend, and good partner of ASEAN,"" Chinse state media quoted Xi as saying.
China’s assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea has set it against ASEAN members Vietnam and the Philippines, while Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts.
The Philippines on Thursday condemned the actions of three Chinese coast guard vessels that it said blocked and used water cannon on resupply boats headed towards a Philippine-occupied atoll in the sea.
The United States on Friday called the Chinese actions ""dangerous, provocative, and unjustified,"" and warned that an armed attack on Philippine vessels would invoke U.S. mutual defence commitments. 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told the summit hosted by Xi that he ""abhors"" the altercation and said the rule of law was the only way out of the dispute. He referred to a 2016 international arbitration ruling which found China's maritime claim to the sea had no legal basis.
""This does not speak well of the relations between our nations,"" said Duterte, who will leave office next year and has been criticised in the past for failing to condemn China's conduct in the disputed waters.
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
MYANMAR NO SHOW
Xi told the summit that China and ASEAN had ""cast off the gloom of the Cold War"" - when the region was wracked by superpower competition and conflicts such as the Vietnam War - and had jointly maintained regional stability.
China frequently criticises the United States for ""Cold War thinking"" when Washington engages its regional allies to push back against Beijing's growing military and economic influence.
U.S. President Joe Biden joined ASEAN leaders for a virtual summit in October and pledged greater engagement with the region. 
The summit was held without a representative from Myanmar, Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said on Monday. The reason for the non-attendance was not immediately clear, and a spokesperson for Myanmar's military government did not answer calls seeking comment.
ASEAN sidelined Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, who has led a bloody crackdown on dissent since seizing power on Feb. 1, from virtual summits last month over his failure to make inroads in implementing an agreed peace plan, in an unprecedented exclusion for the bloc.
Myanmar refused to send junior representation and blamed ASEAN for departing from its non-interference principle and caving to Western pressure.

934,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Indonesia's defence minister has said his country understands the reasons behind the United States, Australia and Britain establishing the AUKUS security agreement, though at a forum at the weekend repeated concerns about an arms race in the region.
The trilateral security pact, formulated in part to respond to a rising China, has sparked regional worries given it allows for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.
When asked about AUKUS at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Manama Dialogue in Bahrain on Saturday, defence minister Prabowo Subianto said he understood why countries would move to secure their interests.
""Officially our position is that of course Southeast Asia should remain nuclear free, and the fear of course among Southeast Asian nations is that this will spark an arms race,"" he said.
""But as I said the emphasis of every country is to protect their national interest. If they feel threatened… they will do whatever they can to protect themselves,"" said Prabowo.
""And this is what I mean that we understand that and we respect them.""
His comments appear to offer a more pragmatic view of the  pact after Indonesia's foreign ministry issued a statement in September saying it was ""deeply concerned"" by the alliance, warning that it could spark a regional arms race.
The security pact comes amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, as countries push back against China’s maritime claims in the strategic, and resource-rich waterway.
On Friday the United States called China’s use of water cannon against Philippine resupply boats in the South China Sea “dangerous, provocative and unjustified"".
Indonesia's navy in September increased patrols around its Natuna islands after Chinese and U.S. vessels were detected in nearby waters, while there has also been recent activity by a Chinese research vessel near an oil rig in the area.

TELECOM SENSATION AT THE OPEN (0843 GMT)
A whopping 30% surge in Telecom Italia shares following KKR's $12 billion takeover approach has ignited the whole telecom sector in Europe with its index (.SXKP) surging as much as 1.6% to its best day since March.
Five out of the top eleven gainers on the STOXX 600 (.STOXX) were telcos, a rare sight for an industry plagued by years by stiff competition and regulation. Communications services provided the second biggest positive weight to the pan-European benchmark, just after financials, in early trading.
Banks (.SX7P) and oil stocks (.SXEP) recovered part of last week's drop, suggesting investors were taking a more balanced view of COVID-19 risks following Friday's scare on Austria's shock move to impose a national lockdown.
Here's you opening snapshot:

LOCKDOWN TRADING (0740 GMT)
Markets have suddenly woken up to COVID-19 risks, and after Austria imposed 10-days of nationwide restrictions to fight the winter virus wave, investors swiftly shifted to lockdown trading mode.
Oil hit 7-week lows in Asia hours, and equities in Europe look set for a muted start after clocking on Friday their first weekly decline in seven weeks, as bond yields and banking stocks tanked. The euro is also under pressure at 16-month lows.
Concerns are that Germany and other countries could follow suit, forcing million of people to stay at home, hitting tourism-dependent economies and outdoor businesses just before key Christmas holidays and spending.
Little wonder then that Italian and Spanish stocks look particularly vulnerable at this stage, while Big Tech and online economy names are once again in favour, sending Nasdaq futures to new record highs overnight.
Shares in vaccine makers meantime could also benefit.    German politicians are debating making COVID-19 vaccinations compulsory, and other countries are also pondering what to do with  the unvaccinated.
On the corporate front, eyes are on Telecom Italia after KKR made a $12 billion approach to take the Italian phone group private. Ericsson is also on the watch-list after the equipment maker agreed to buy cloud communications firm Vonage for $6.2 billion.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:

944,"TAIPEI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders grew more slowly than expected in October due to supply problems in the tech sector, though the government said technology demand overall remained strong ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season and into next year.
Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 14.6% from a year earlier to $59.1 billion in October, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Monday.
While that was the 20th month of expansion, the pace was much slower than the median forecast for a rise of 22.8% in a Reuters poll.
The ministry said a ""lack of raw materials for some products"" dragged down orders, pointing to electronics goods, but added that consumer demand to support digital lifestyles remained solid, especially for things like 5G.
The ministry's statistics director Huang Yu-ling said supply chain problems had impacted orders for goods like chips and notebooks.
The end of the year is traditionally busy for Taiwanese suppliers due to the Christmas and New Year holidays, followed by the Lunar New Year in February.
Taiwanese companies such as Foxconn (2317.TW) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW),  are major suppliers to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and other global tech firms.
Looking ahead, the ministry warned of uncertainty from continued interruptions to the global supply chain and from the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, stockpiling ahead of 2022's Lunar New Year - the most important holiday in the Chinese-speaking world - and demand for 5G and other new technologies will help maintain steady growth for export orders, the ministry added.
In September, export orders jumped 25.7% from a year earlier to $62.9 billion. read more 
The ministry said it expects export orders in November to rise between 2.1% and 4.7% from a year earlier.
Orders from the United States rose 0.5% in October from a year earlier, a far slower rate of expansion compared with the 29.3% logged in September, while orders from China were up 21.7%, versus a gain of 11.5% the previous month.
Orders from Europe grew 18.2%, while those from Japan were up 4.1%.",0
945,"LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The British pound held near its strongest levels since early 2020 against the beaten-down euro on Monday but slipped against the dollar, which rallied after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was nominated for a second four-year term.
Sterling briefly touched 83.80 pence per euro , a new Feb. 2020 high against the single currency which was hit by  Austria's decision to reimpose a full COVID-19 lockdown. [nL1N2SD0L8]

Sterling has firmed more than 2% against the euro since hitting one-month lows on Nov.5.

Money markets currently price in about 13 basis points worth of tightening at the BoE's Dec. 16 meeting.
The BoE wrong-footed many investors this month when it did not lift rates from their record low 0.1%, following comments from Bailey in late October which markets interpreted as a signal that a rate hike was very near.
Since then, inflation has risen to a 10-year high of 4.2% and jobless data has not pointed towards higher unemployment after the end of the furlough scheme - a key concern that stayed the BoE's hand in November.
Confusion over when the BoE will move has prompted hedge funds to dump sterling with funds the most bearish on the pound since June last year, latest positioning data from Chicago futures markets suggests.

947,"LIMA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Hochschild Mining (HOCM.L) collapsed 27% on Monday after Peru's government ruled out any operational extensions for its flagship Inmaculada silver mine, but mining executives and government officials also said they had had a ""productive"" late night meeting to ease tensions.
Mining is key to the economy of Peru, which is the world's No. 2 producer of copper and silver.
Peru's prime minister, Mirtha Vasquez, said on Friday that a group of four mines - including two owned by Hochschild - would not be granted any further operational extensions due to environmental concerns and would instead close down in the near future.
""We haven't discussed anything specific,"" said Raul Jacob, who heads the National Society of Mining, Energy and Oil, following a meeting with Vasquez. ""I do want to say there was very good open dialogue, very productive.""
Vasquez agreed ""dialogue had been very productive.""
""We have expressed our will to respect the rule of law (and) private investment,"" she told reporters.
The original announcement triggered a furious reaction from mining executives over the weekend and caused Hochschild's shares to plummet as much as 57%, before paring losses for a 27% drop, the worst for the London-listed miner.
Vasquez's new statement follows remarks from Peru's vice minister of mines, who appeared to backtrack on the closure decision in an interview on Sunday night.
""If (the mining companies) have all the mechanisms to present an extension, they can do so, the door is not closed,"" Chavez said.
According to a government statement, Vasquez's initial announcement said the mines would be closed as soon as possible on environmental concerns, with ""no extensions, whether for exploitation, exploration or even shutdown.""
Peru is currently in the process of proposing higher taxes on miners, and socialist President Pedro Castillo has said the additional revenue will be crucial to fund social programs.
The announcement triggered broader remarks about the sector.
""No information suggests that the government will close other mines but we cannot rule out it will go after large(r) mines,"" Bank of America said in a note, in which it also downgraded Hochschild from ""buy"" to ""underperform.""
Hochschild said it had not received any formal communication from Peru's government on the matter and had found out through the press and social media.
""She’s just gone rogue. That arm of the government doesn’t have the right to do what it did,"" said a source with direct knowledge of company discussions. ""We'll take the arbitration route if it comes to that - most definitely.""
In a statement, Hochschild Chief Executive Officer Ignacio Bustamante said the company was prepared to enter ""into a dialogue with the government in order to resolve any misunderstandings.""
Any ruling in Peru would also hurt Hochschild's Pallancata mine.
The Inmaculada mine is the company's biggest, representing over 60% of its cash flow, according to its 2020 annual report. Both mines account for the bulk of the company's production.",0
948,"FRANKFURT, Nov 22 (Reuters) - No big euro zone lender meets the European Central Bank's climate risk management goals, the ECB said on Monday, just months before it is due to run the biggest climate stress test to date.
The ECB outlined its climate and environment risk-related expectations a year ago but banks appear to be slow in adapting them and the supervisor has repeatedly called on lenders to pick up the pace.
""Banks have taken initial steps towards incorporating climate-related risks, but none is close to meeting all supervisory expectations,"" the ECB said in a statement.
""Only one-third of banks have plans in place that are at least broadly adequate, and half won’t have completed implementation of their plans by the end of 2022,"" it added.
Banks have made progress in meeting ECB expectations regarding management bodies, risk appetite and operational risk management. But they are failing in areas like internal reporting, market and liquidity risk management, and stress testing, the ECB said.
Less than one-fifth have developed key risk indicators to monitor while those banks which concluded that they are not exposed to climate-related risks all had significant shortcomings in their assessment, the ECB said.
The ECB plans a full review of banks' preparations along with the climate stress test in the first half of 2022.
Climate risk is expected to be ""gradually"" incorporated into capital requirements, indicating that non-compliant lenders will eventually be forced to beef up their capital positions.",0
949,"MUMBAI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Rising prices of commodities needed for renewable energy will increase the costs of setting up new green power projects, but this will be balanced by better access to funds and economies of scale, policy advisers and an investor said.
The rising costs, as well as supply chain problems for some of the commodities and goods needed for green projects, won't be a long-term threat to the economic viability of clean energy, they told the Reuters Global Markets Forum last week.
Overhead costs that will fall with economies of scale include items such as permit fees, labour costs for installations and customer acquisition costs.
Overall costs for the industry will trend downwards as there are few barriers to scaling up, said Harry Boyd Carpenter, managing director for green economy and climate change at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Vaibhav Chaturvedi, fellow at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), saw ""greenflation"", or the costs associated with going green, as a concern, especially in the short-term.
""Underlying commodity prices are rising everywhere in the world,"" he said.
Prices of metals such as tin , aluminium , copper , nickel  cobalt , that are essential to energy transition technologies, have risen between 20% and 91% this year.
But Chaturvedi saw the lowering cost of finance as a ""big leverage"" to counter the increase in underlying costs.
Allied Market Research projects the global renewable energy market, valued at over $881 billion in 2020, to more than double to nearly $2 trillion by 2030.
Gauri Singh, deputy director-general at the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), argued that despite inflation and supply chain disruptions, decreasing financing costs helped in record generation of 260 gigawatts of energy from renewable sources last year.
""You will not actually get cheap money for anything that's a climate risk. Whereas for renewables, the market is softening,"" Singh said.",0
950,"MILAN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Energy group Eni (ENI.MI) could list up to 30% of its new retail and renewables business in what is likely to be one of Italy's biggest initial public offerings next year.
At a presentation on Monday Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said between 20% and 30% of the unit, renamed Plenitude, could be listed depending on market conditions.
""The IPO is a cornerstone of our decarbonisation strategy and key to our ongoing transformation,"" Descalzi said at the unveiling of Plenitude.
Sources close to the matter told Reuters earlier on Monday Eni could sell a bit more than 30% if demand was there.
Eni said last month it had decided to list a minority stake in Plenitude as part of broader plans to unlock value across its business and fund its shift away from oil and gas. Sources have previously said the unit, created earlier this year, could be worth around 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion).
Some European energy companies, including Spain's Repsol (REP.MC), are looking at selling parts of their green business to raise money to cut debt and fund their transition from fossil fuel.
Plenitude, which has 10 million customers in six countries, will spend 7.8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) to 2025 to help drive core earnings to 1.3 billion euros from 0.6 billion euros this year.
CEO Stefano Goberti said the company aimed to pay a dividend but added the priority would be on growth and keeping a strong balance sheet.
Renewable capacity, mainly solar, will grow to more than 6 gigawatts by 2025 from 1.2 GW this year, mainly in markets where Eni already has a client base.
But the company is also interested in growing its offshore wind business and is looking to Norway, the United States and Italy.
In April Eni's finance head Francesco Gattei said merging its renewable energy and retail operations could create a vehicle with double-digit multiples.

952,"NEW DELHI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - India is not considering authorising booster COVID-19 doses yet as many in the country have been naturally infected and the government believes two doses of a vaccine offers sufficient protection for now, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
As vaccine supplies have increased, some doctors and public health experts in India have urged the government to start a booster programme for the most vulnerable like many Western nations have done.
But authorities will instead concentrate on having most of India's 944 million adults complete a two-dose vaccination by January before shifting their focus to a big expansion in exports, said the sources who are involved in vaccine-policy discussions.
So far, 81% of India's adults have received at least one dose while 43% have had two doses. Vaccination for people under 18 has not yet begun.
""The priority is to fully immunise the adult population,"" said one of the sources. The sources declined to be named as the matter was still being discussed by policy makers.
""A big majority has been naturally infected, and for them two doses are enough. That's why we are seeing that even after recent festivals, cases are not rising.""
The source said that once most adults have had two vaccine doses, the government could make boosters optional.
The health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
India reported the most COVID-19 case and death figures in the world in April and May and government surveys have shown that nearly 70% of Indians were naturally infected by July. The country has so far logged 34.5 million infections - the most after the United States - with more than 465,000 deaths.
Although India celebrated two of its biggest festivals, Diwali and Durga Puja in October and November, infections have fallen to multi-month lows.
Many Western countries are expanding their booster programmes, even for people without compromised immunity - a policy which the World Health Organization has heavily criticised.
Indian vaccine companies like the Serum Institute of India, which produces licensed versions of the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Novavax (NVAX.O) shots, expect the government to allow boosters some time early next year.  read more 
Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (REDY.NS) says it is in talks with India's drug regulator to sell Russia's Sputnik Light as a booster dose.

The newspaper cited ""city sources"" as saying Apollo considered M&S a bargain, with the group's shares unreasonably weighed down by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the market failing to attribute enough value to M&S's 50% stake in Ocado's (OCDO.L) retail business.
The Sunday Times said it was unclear whether Apollo's interest had been dampened by the recent surge in M&S shares - up 33% over the last month.

963,"BRUSSELS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A greater number of countries are sliding towards authoritarianism, while the number of established democracies under threat has never been so high, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) said on Monday.
Populist politics, the use of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions to silence critics, a tendency of countries to mimic the anti-democratic behaviour of others, and disinformation used to divide societies are mainly to blame, the Stockholm-based intergovernmental organisation said in a report.
""More countries than ever are suffering from 'democratic erosion',"" IDEA said in its 2021 study on the state of democracy, relying on data compiled since 1975.
""The number of countries undergoing 'democratic backsliding' has never been as high,"" it said, referring to the regressive turn in areas including checks on government and judicial independence, as well as media freedom and human rights.
Afghanistan, which was taken over by Taliban militants in August after international troops withdrew, is the most dramatic case this year, while Myanmar's Feb. 1 coup marked the collapse of a fragile democracy. Other examples include Mali, which has suffered two coups since 2020, and Tunisia, where the president has dissolved parliament and assumed emergency powers.
Large democracies such as Brazil and the United States have seen presidents question the validity of election results, while India has witnessed the prosecution of groups of people critical of government policies.
Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Serbia are the European countries with the greatest declines in democracy. Turkey has seen one of the largest declines between 2010 and 2020.
""In fact, 70 per cent of the global population now live either in non-democratic regimes or in democratically backsliding countries,"" the report said.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in authoritarian behaviour by governments. The study said that there was no evidence that authoritarian regimes were better at fighting the pandemic, despite Chinese state media reports to the contrary.
""The pandemic provides additional tools and justification for repressive tactics and silencing of dissent in countries as diverse as Belarus, Cuba, Myanmar, Nicaragua and Venezuela,"" the report said.",0

Ning won gold in 1:45.16 and took the lead in the World Cup rankings from South Korean Kim Min-Seok, who won bronze in Stavanger. American Joey Mantia took the silver medal to complete the podium.
Ning, who stepped up his game after last week's silver medal in the Poland leg of the World Cup, said the gold medal will boost his confidence before the 2022 Winter Olympics begin in Beijing on Feb. 4.
""It's very important for me to win this medal. It gives me great confidence for the Olympic year going forward,"" Ning said in a statement.

965,"PARIS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Eric Zemmour, the hard-right French political commentator and likely presidential candidate, said on Monday that fears about the new coronavirus had been overblown.
Zemmour's stance contrasts with the position of governments across Europe, which are reintroducing restrictions on movement to curb a fifth wave of the pandemic, with Austria on Monday going into a full lockdown.  read more .
""We need to put this epidemic back in the right proportion. We have played a lot on people's fears. We have gone too far, and we've been going too far since the beginning,"" Zemmour told France Info radio.
French opinion polls have Zemmour challenging rival far-right politician Marine Le Pen, from the Rassemblement National party, for second place, and thus a place in a runoff in next year's election against the survey leader and incumbent president, Emmanuel Macron. Polls make Macron the likely winner in the second round.
Zemmour, known for his hardline position on issues such as immigration, Islam and national identity, said would roll out a third, COVID vaccine booster shot only for those aged over 65 - as opposed to the French regulator's recommendation to make it available to those aged over 40. 
He also said he would aim eventually to scrap the COVID health pass currently used in France, used to show proof vaccination status to enter bars, restaurants, museums and sports venues.
Zemmour spent last weekend in London, courting the city's large expatriate French population. He is expected to confirm his presidential candidacy on Dec. 5.  read more ",0
966,"NAIROBI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Deep in Kenya's Great Rift Valley, members of the National Youth Service tirelessly swing machetes to clear dense shrubs obscuring railway tracks more than a century old.
It's a distinctly low-tech phase for China's Belt and Road drive in Africa to create the trade highways of the future.
There's not enough money left to complete the new 1,000-km super-fast rail link from the port of Mombasa to Uganda. It ends abruptly in the countryside, 468 km short of the border, and now Kenya is resorting to finishing the route by revamping the 19th-century colonial British-built tracks that once passed that way.
China has lent African countries hundreds of billions of dollars as part of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which envisaged Chinese institutions financing the bulk of the infrastructure in mainly developing nations. Yet the credit has dried up in recent years.
On top of the damage wrought to both China and its creditors by COVID-19, analysts and academics attribute the slowdown to factors such as a waning appetite in Beijing for large foreign investments, a commodity price crash that has complicated African debt servicing, plus some borrowers' reluctance to enter lending deals backed by their natural resources.
""We are not in the go-go period anymore,"" Adam Tooze, a Columbia University historian, said about China's overseas investment projects. ""There is definitely a rebalancing from the China side,"" said Tooze, whose new book Shutdown examines how COVID-19 affected the world economy, adding that Beijing's current account surplus was ""dwindling somewhat"".
Chinese investments in the 138 countries targeted by BRI slid 54% from 2019 to $47 billion last year, the lowest amount since the BRI was unveiled in 2013, according to Green BRI, a China-based think-tank that focuses on analysing the initiative.
In Africa, home to 40 of those BRI nations, Chinese bank financing for infrastructure projects fell from $11 billion in 2017 to $3.3 billion in 2020, according to a report by international law firm Baker McKenzie.
This is a blow for governments who were anticipating securing Chinese loans to build highways and rail lines linking landlocked countries to sea ports and trade routes to Asia and Europe. The continent is facing an estimated annual infrastructure investment deficit of around $100 billion, according to the African Development Bank.
""The pandemic has actually made things worse. Those numbers will go up,"" said Akinwumi Adesina, the president of the bank, citing the need for additional infrastructure to support health services.
Hold-ups have hit some other BRI projects across the continent, such as a $3 billion Nigerian rail project and a $450 million highway in Cameroon.
China's ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to a request for comment.
Beijing officials have said that the two sides have a mutually beneficial and cooperative relationship and that lending is done openly and transparently.
""When providing interest-free loans and concessional loans, we fully consider the debt situation and repayment capacity of the recipient countries in Africa, and work in accordance with the law,"" Zhou Liujun, vice chairman of China International Development Cooperation Agency told reporters in late October.
Another Chinese official, who declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media, said Beijing always intended to implement BRI gradually to manage debt default risks by countries or projects.
'RAILWAY WILL BE BUILT'
Officials in Kenya said its rail route were long-term projects that would be seen through over time, without giving any specific timeframe. The COVID-19 has presented the world with unforeseen and unprecedented challenges, they added.
""Eventually, this standard gauge railway will still be complete because it is part of what we call the Belt and Road Initiative,"" said James Macharia, Kenya's transport minister.
The government has already spent about $5 billion on its new rail link, and can't currently afford the additional $3.7 billion needed to finish it. The last station hooked up is only accessible by dirt roads.
Hence engineers in the Rift Valley are no longer building new infrastructure, but rather shoring up colonial-era viaducts and bridges in an operation that the government estimates will cost about 10 billion shillings ($91 million).
There are knock-on effects and, over the border in Uganda, construction on a modern railway line has been delayed because it's supposed to link to the Kenyan one.
That has been one factor in the hold-up in a $2.2 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim Bank), David Mugabe, spokesperson for Uganda's Standard Gauge Railway project, told Reuters.
In Nigeria, the government turned to London-headquartered Standard Chartered Bank (STAN.L) this year to finance the $3 billion railway project initially slated to receive Chinese backing. Standard Chartered declined to comment on the deal, citing confidentiality agreements.
In Cameroon, the $450 million highway linking the capital Yaounde and the economic hub of Douala, whose funding was secured from China's Exim Bank in 2012, stalled in 2019 as the bank stopped disbursing further tranches of the loan.
Exim Bank did not respond to a request for comment on its loans to Uganda and Cameroon.
MALAYSIA TO BOLIVIA
Zhou Yuyuan, Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for West Asian and African Studies at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said the COVID-19 crisis had strained Chinese lending institutions and African finances alike.
In future, he added, Beijing was likely to encourage more corporate Chinese investment in the continent, to fill the role of state-backed financing. ""Once the pandemic is over, Africa's economy is likely to recover,"" he said. ""That could drive China's corporate investment.""
The pandemic has added to the obstacles facing President Xi's self-described ""project of the century"". After peaking at $125.25 billion in 2015, Chinese investments into BRI nations have dropped every year, apart from 2018, when they edged up 6.7%, the Green BRI data showed.
In 2018, Pakistan balked at the cost and the financing terms of building a railway. The previous year, there were signs of growing problems for BRI, after China's push in Sri Lanka sparked protests.
AidData, a research lab at the College of William and Mary in the United States, said in a study at the end of September that $11.58 billion in projects in Malaysia had been cancelled over 2013-2021, with nearly $1.5 billion cancelled in Kazakhstan and more than a $1 billion in Bolivia.
""A growing number of policymakers in low and middle-income countries are mothballing high-profile BRI projects because of overpricing, corruption and debt sustainability concerns,"" said Brad Parks, one of the study's authors.
China's foreign ministry said in response to the AidData report that ""not all debts are unsustainable"", adding that since its launch the BRI had ""consistently upheld principles of shared consultation, shared contributions and shared benefits"".
'RESOURCES ARE FINITE'
A key problem is debt sustainability.
Copper producer Zambia became Africa's first pandemic-era sovereign default last year after failing to keep up with payments on more than $12 billion of international debt, for example. A recent study suggested more than half of that burden is owed to Chinese public and private lenders.  read more 
In late 2018, Beijing agreed to restructure billions of dollars in debt owed by Ethiopia.
Some African governments are also growing more reluctant to take out loans backed commodities such as oil and metals.
""We can't mortgage our oil,"" Uganda's works and transport minister Katumba Wamala told Reuters, confirming the country had refused to pledge untapped oil in fields in the west to secure the railway loan.
The finance squeeze means African governments must make more strategic investment decisions in terms of debt sustainability, said Yvette Babb, a Netherlands-based fixed income portfolio manager at William Blair.
""There is no infinite amount of capital,"" she said.

Markets have suddenly woken up to COVID-19 risks, and after Austria imposed 10-days of nationwide restrictions to fight the winter virus wave, investors swiftly shifted to lockdown trading mode.
Oil hit 7-week lows in Asia hours, and equities in Europe look set for a muted start after clocking on Friday their first weekly decline in seven weeks, as bond yields and banking stocks tanked. The euro is also under pressure at 16-month lows.
Concerns are that Germany and other countries could follow suit, forcing million of people to stay at home, hitting tourism-dependent economies and outdoor businesses just before key Christmas holidays and spending.

972,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a tweet on Monday that the Model S Plaid will ""probably"" be coming to China, the electric-car maker's second-largest market, around March.
The company introduced a new Model S Plaid, a 520-mile range sedan that can reach top speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (320 km per hour), in September last year, with deliveries starting in 2021. 
Musk, known for his Twitter banter, did not provide any further details in his tweet. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There is demand in China, at least initially, for the Model S Plaid, especially among high-end luxury automotive buyers, Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said.
While Tesla has weathered the chip crisis better than rivals and legacy automakers, some analysts believe supply-chain issues could raise costs and negatively affect margins.
The electric-vehicle maker's Shanghai factory helped sustain the company when its factory in Fremont, California was forced to shut down due to pandemic-related curbs early last year.
Tesla could also export the Model S Plaid to other markets in Europe and Asia, so it makes sense to add the model to the Shanghai site, Goldstein said.

The meeting resulted in an American table tennis team being invited to China to play what the Chinese know as ""ping-pong"", ultimately paving the way for U.S. President Richard Nixon's trip to the country in 1972.
China's Lin Gaoyuan and Wang Manyu will partner Americans Lily Zhang and Kanak Jha, respectively, at the Nov. 23-29 event in Houston, the ITTF said in a statement.
""I'm really happy to be partnering with Lily Zhang for the mixed doubles event,"" Lin said. ""She's the top table tennis player in the U.S. I'm not China's top player yet, but our goal is to come out on top for this event.
""The biggest advantage about pairing with her is that she speaks Mandarin. I hope we can get into the groove soon, develop good chemistry and work hard towards a great performance.""",0

986,"LONDON/MILAN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Having weathered the COVID-19 crisis on the back of the ECB's 1.85 trillion-euro emergency stimulus package, the fragile bond markets of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece face a crucial stability test as the scheme approaches its final months.
The crisis-time programme, known as PEPP, allowed the European Central Bank more leeway in buying member states' bonds and complemented an existing but less flexible Asset Purchase Programme (APP) that has been in place since 2015.
But the PEPP, short for Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, expires in March. Unless it is extended, investors estimate the ECB must at least double APP purchase volumes or risk seeing borrowing costs spiral for the periphery - a term used to describe the poorer southern European euro zone states.
The ECB backstop allowed these countries to borrow and spend freely during the pandemic without being punished by markets. But the equilibrium is precarious; sudden fears of a 2022 ECB rate rise pushed Italian yields 13 basis points (bps) higher on Oct. 29, the biggest daily rise since April 2020.
""It won't be easy to deal with the end of PEPP in March and prevent a hawkish mistake,"" said Mauro Valle, head of fixed income at Generali Investments Partners, noting above-target inflation across the bloc.
ECB chief Christine Lagarde has said asset purchases would remain ""important"" after March, but hawkish ECB officials are already pushing for less generous bond-buying. Austria's Robert Holzmann, for instance, suggests net purchases could end next September, while Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot said ending PEPP did not imply a step-up in APP.
That uncertainty may already be weighing; Italy's yield spread over Germany - essentially the risk premium investors demand to hold Italian debt - is up 20 bps in the past month to around 120 bps .
That's far below the 300 bps-plus reached last March, before PEPP, but ""peripheral spreads have probably gotten to the tightest levels they are going to get to"", according to Timothy Graf, State Street's head of EMEA macro strategy.
Spanish 10-year bond yields are up 33 bps this year, the biggest rise since 2010 while the spread over Germany at 72 bps , is about 10 bps wider from month ago levels.
SUPPORT
There are reasons to believe the spread blowouts seen in March 2020 won't be repeated. For one, there is now an 800 billion-euro EU recovery fund which is disbursing hefty amounts in loans and grants to southern Europe.
Economies are recovering fast, credit ratings are improving and low yield levels will keep debt servicing risks in check.
Still, many are pessimistic the ECB can keep borrowing costs from rising once PEPP expires.
To keep hoovering up the majority of debt issuance, it would need to roughly double the size of monthly APP to an average 40-50 billion euros, according to calculations by several banks.
Unicredit estimates the ECB must buy around 700 billion worth of assets in 2022 to keep financing conditions steady. That implies doubling APP to 500 billion euros between March and year-end.
While that would be less than the roughly 750 billion euros spent so far this year, Unicredit says that ""given the mood at the ECB these days, a doubling of the APP to accompany the end of PEPP is just not a realistic prospect. A withdrawal of monetary stimulus over the next six months by the ECB is now baked.""
In Italy, the most sensitive market, NatWest estimates 2022  bond issuance at minus 26 billion euros, net of ECB bond purchases and redemptions - versus this year's minus 88 billion euros.
There are two other risks.
First, APP lacks the flexibility of the PEPP. The latter allows the ECB to deviate from its ""capital key"" and buy bonds according to need rather than the size of the economy.
Second is the continued speculation over interest rates.
BofA fixed income strategist Erjon Satko said that if markets price two rate hikes next year, that would suggest an end to ECB bond-buying in mid-2022.
In that scenario, ""even assuming an increase in the APP to 40-50 billion euros per month, the balance between supply and central bank net purchases will be positive, of around 150 billion euros in 2022"", Satko said.
Money markets have scaled back bets on an ECB rate hike, no longer pricing a full chance of a 10 bps rate increase by December 2022, though the probability is still seen above 50% .
It would mean net bond supply could be positive next year  for the first time since 2015, potentially a recipe for significant spread widening.",0

990,"MELBOURNE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Pat Cummins should have first shot at Australia's test captaincy in the wake of Tim Paine's resignation, having won the respect of his team mates as a leader, former skipper Adam Gilchrist has said.
Australia will name a new captain in the leadup to the Ashes after Paine sensationally stepped down from the role last week over a 'sexting' scandal.  read more 
Wicketkeeper-batsman Gilchrist was a successful understudy to captains Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting, leading Australia in six of his 96 tests, including a first series win in India in 35 years during the 2004 tour.
""I think Pat Cummins is the frontrunner there. I’ve got no problems with him having first opportunity,"" the 50-year-old told Reuters.
""They should have him if he’s keen to do it -- and he must be reasonably happy to take the role given he’s vice captain.""
Like other major cricket nations, Australia has been reluctant to appoint bowlers as captains, with most coming from the batting ranks.
Cummins would be only the second specialist fast bowler in the role since Ray Lindwall led in one test against India in the mid-1950s.  read more 
""I see no reason to pigeonhole Pat as a fast bowler who can’t do it,"" said Gilchrist.
""I think he’s had a huge amount of respect from everyone, really -- particularly from his team mates, so I think that’s the way they will lean.""
Steve Smith, who completed a two-year suspension from leadership roles last year for his part in the 2018 Newlands ball-tampering scandal, is eligible for the captaincy and has voiced his hopes of taking it on again.
However, pundits are divided as to whether the public would be ready to embrace the batsman again for a position often referred to as Australia's ""second highest office in the land"" after the Prime Minister.
Gilchrist said 28-year-old Cummins had stepped up as a senior leader while Smith was banned from leadership.
""I just think Pat Cummins has developed into a more integral part of that team and grown in his knowledge of the game and experiences he’s had,"" he added.
""I think it’s a case of whilst you’re away someone else has come in over the top of you, to an extent.

993,"MELBOURNE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) and BHP Group (BHP.AX) gave their  final go-aheads to spend $12 billion to develop the Scarborough gas field off Western Australia and expand the Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, with the first cargo expected in 2026.
The approval on Monday came at the same time that Woodside and BHP signed an agreement to merge BHP's petroleum arm into Woodside to create a global top 10 independent oil and gas producer, as announced in August.  read more 
""Today's decisions set Woodside on a transformative path. Scarborough will be a significant contributor to Woodside’s cash flows, the funding of future developments and new energy products, and shareholder returns,"" Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill said in a statement.
The twinned Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 project is essential to the future of Woodside, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas company, which has had limited growth over the past several years.
The final decision for the project was deferred in March last year when oil and gas prices crashed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Spot Asian LNG prices have rocketed from lows last year below $2 per million British thermal units to more than $37 per MMBtu.
Scarborough will be able to produce 8 million tonnes a year of LNG for export and 180 terajoules a day of gas for the domestic market. Customers have signed up to buy about 60% of Scarborough capacity, including for a proposed urea plant in Western Australia, O'Neill said.
Scarborough gas, which will be processed through Pluto Train 2, will be one of the lowest carbon intensity sources of LNG delivered to north Asia, Woodside said.
It said the all-in cost of LNG shipped to north Asia would be around $5.80 per MMBtu, delivering a strong return on the project.
Woodside's share of investment in the project is $6.9 billion, to be funded off its balance sheet. BHP on Monday signed off on $1.5 billion for the first phase of Scarborough development. It is not a stakeholder in the Pluto LNG plant.
To spread the cost of the project, Woodside last week agreed to sell a 49% stake in Pluto Train 2 to Global Infrastructure Partners.  read more 
""The announcement confirms that Scarborough economics have improved for Woodside in the wake of the infrastructure selldown,"" Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said.
Green groups have sought to derail the project amid fears  carbon emissions from Scarborough gas will worsen global warming.  read more 
O'Neill dismissed concerns about remaining environmental approvals pending for the project.
""As we work through the series of secondary approvals, it is entirely possible that the regulators will ask us to take additional steps, and that's quite normal,"" she told Reuters.
A court will hold its first hearing on Dec. 20 on a case brought last year by the Conservation Council of Western Australia (CCWA). The case challenges the state's approval, without a full environmental review, allowing Woodside to process gas at the Pluto LNG plant from an expanded number of fields. 
The CCWA said on Monday it would continue with a coordinated national campaign against Scarborough gas.",0

996,"MOSCOW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The suspension of the approval process for the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline by a German regulator could be short-lived as Europe is hungry for more gas, an analyst said on Monday after meeting officials of Russian state gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM).
Last week, Germany's energy regulator temporarily halted the certification process for the new pipeline that will carry Russian gas into Europe, throwing up a new roadblock to the contentious project and driving up regional gas prices.  read more 
German government sources told Reuters that the suspension could delay commissioning of the infrastructure until next March.  read more 
The German regulator said certification was being temporarily halted because under German law the Swiss-based consortium behind Nord Stream 2 first needed to form a German subsidiary company to secure an operating licence.
Ronald Smith, an analyst at Moscow-based BCS brokerage, told Reuters following a call with Gazprom senior managers that that may only take a few weeks and that Gazprom - which is leading the Nord Stream 2 project - had not been surprised by the delay.
""It seems to have been a suggestion by the regulator for Nord Stream 2 to establish a German entity, and looking at the announcement, they will proceed with the approval process once the registration is done. My guess, it may take two to three weeks,"" he said.
""The suspension of the approval by the German regulator was not a surprise for Gazprom. The Germans want to get the approval done, they are in the middle of an energy crisis,"" he said. 
The German regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, did not respond to a request for further comment.
Gazprom and Nord Stream 2 both declined to comment on the expected start date for gas exports via the link. The Russian government has said it did not believe that politics were behind the suspension.
A source at Gazprom said the company was willing to work in line with the legal requirements. Gazprom is unlikely to start exporting gas via the link before it gains regulatory approval, the source said.
Natural gas prices have been volatile in Europe in the past week, since the suspension of the approval process and due to COVID 19-related lockdowns and the subsequent impact on energy demand.

U.S. President Joe Biden has asked China, India, South Korea and Japan for a coordinated oil stocks release as U.S. gasoline prices soar and his approval ratings slump ahead of next year's congressional elections.
The U.S. government has been unable to persuade OPEC+ to pump more oil, with major producers arguing the world was not short of crude.
OPEC and other producers including Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, have been adding around 400,000 barrels per day to the market on a monthly basis, but have resisted Biden's calls for more rapid increases, arguing the rebound in demand could be fragile.
The threat of a coordinated release, along with new coronavirus-related lockdowns in Europe, has knocked the wind out of crude oil's rally. Brent crude was last trading at $79.30 a barrel, down more than $7 from a peak reached in late October.
Citigroup analysts estimated in a note that the United States could release anywhere from 45 million to 60 million barrels from its reserves that would bring forward about 20 million in already approved sales. The bank said a combined release could be at ""on the order of 100-120 million bbls or higher.""
One source familiar with the discussions, however, said the input from China and other countries is still very much up in the air, and that nations like India and South Korea would be likely to contribute a small amount of barrels.
Such a move could compel OPEC+ to also reassess whether it would continue its current course of steady increases, said Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the Riyadh-based International Energy Forum (IEF).
""If they are going to make a change, it will be because of unforeseen external factors, such as these lockdowns in Europe, any kind of strategic release, and shifts in jet fuel demand,"" said McMonigle. The IEF is the largest international organization of energy ministers and includes Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia.
The increase in COVID cases in Europe supports recent comments from the likes of OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo, who said the market will soon be facing a surplus. In that case, OPEC members with more room to boost output may instead prefer to maintain current production or even reduce it.
""An SPR release could easily backfire,"" said Troy Vincent, market analyst at DTN.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signalled his readiness to release stocks over the weekend.  read more 
Three Indian government sources said on Monday they were holding consultations with the United States on the release of oil from strategic reserves.
Japan, the world's fourth-biggest oil buyer, is restricted on how it can act with its reserves - made up of both private and public stocks - which typically can only be used in times of shortage.
One Japanese source said the government was looking into releasing from the portion of state-held stocks outside the minimum amount required as a legal workaround.
Japan's oil reserve held 145 days' worth of daily petroleum consumption at the end of September, according to official data, well above the minimum 90 days required by law.
Japanese private companies including refiners hold about 175 million barrels of crude and oil products as part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), enough for around 90 days' consumption, according to state agency Jogmec.
India holds about 26.5 million barrels of oil in its SPR.",0
998,"SINGAPORE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A return to stricter COVID-19 curbs in Singapore will be a ""last resort"", Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday, as the city-state partially eased limits on social gatherings and dining out under its calibrated reopening approach.
Ong also said the international travel and tourism hub would continue to open ""travel lanes"" with more countries for vaccinated visitors.
Singapore is gradually granting small groups of vaccinated people increased liberties, resuming in-person business events and permitting quarantine-free travel from select countries as it ramps up its vaccine booster programme.
""I feel it's important to do it this way, because it minimizes the chance of us having to backpedal too frequently,"" Ong told Reuters in an interview on Monday for the upcoming Reuters Next conference.
""You can't rule out having to throttle back sometimes, but it should always be a last resort, because it's extremely frustrating for people.""
Singapore has vacillated between tightening and easing  restrictions for its population of 5.45 million in recent months as, like many countries, it was hit by a fresh wave of infections fuelled by the Delta variant.
Ong said it was too difficult to put a timeframe on when Singapore would reach a ""new normal"", but he hoped the country's high vaccination rates and the current roll-out of booster shots  meant it would continue to ease restrictions.
""I hope that whatever liberty that we now gradually, progressively can return back to the people, we can keep them for next year, even as a new wave arrives,"" said Ong.
Singapore was one of several so-called COVID-zero countries that enforced some of the world's strictest measures to keep infections and deaths from the pandemic - at around 252,200 and 662, respectively - relatively low.
This year, it switched to a strategy of living with the virus as endemic. Around 94% of those eligible have been vaccinated, while 23% of the total population has received a booster shot.
Among its latest easing measures, limits on social gatherings and dining out were eased from two to five people, still restrictive compared to many other countries.
Authorities have also tightened measures against unvaccinated people, effectively barring them from dining out or entering malls and will begin to charge them for COVID-19 treatment if they refused a vaccine by choice.
TRAVEL HUB
Singapore has been expanding quarantine free travel from more than a dozen countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Australia, Canada and the United States via so-called vaccinated ""travel lanes.""
It will start these lanes with Malaysia and India at the end of the month. The lanes allow fully vaccinated people to enter the island without quarantining if they pass their COVID-19 tests.
""It is important for us to establish this, as such a small outwardly oriented country, we need to connect with the world,"" said Ong. ""For the foreseeable future, I think vaccinated travel lanes will be the norm.""

999,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Former England international Jack Rodwell says he did not move to Australia to wind down his career after making an impact on his debut for A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers.
Rodwell was unveiled last week and came off the bench with 13 minutes remaining of his side's 0-0 draw with Sydney FC in Saturday's opening round of the new A-League season.
""I'm 30 years old and I still feel like that I've got the best years ahead of me,"" Rodwell told the club's website after the game. ""That's why I came here, I didn't come here to come on holiday. I'm here to give it my all.
""We've got a great team here, great manager so let's see what we can do.""
The former Everton midfielder was in the thick of the action soon after he was introduced for Terry Antonis and looked set to open the scoring with a long-distance effort that Sydney's Andrew Redmayne kept out with a sprawling save to his left.
""I thought it was in all the way,"" said Rodwell.
""It was a great save actually. It would have been the icing on my cake for my debut.""
Wanderers manager Carl Robinson was pleased with the contribution of the former Manchester City man, but admitted it will take time before Rodwell will be fit enough to start.
""I was pleased when he came on,"" said Robinson. ""He brought a bit of calmness to our game. He's got an authoritative stature about him. Just nice to see him on the field.
""He's literally been training for two weeks,"" added the Welshman.
""We've got to be careful because the last thing that I want to do is throw him out there, get injured and then us as a club and the supporters not see him for two months.
""It'll take time, but hopefully in the next few weeks we'll see him get up to speed and compete in midfield for us.""",0
1000,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Fifteen medical and human rights groups are urging U.S. President Joe Biden to get personally engaged in a long-running fight to enact an intellectual property waiver for COVID-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, calling his leadership ""a moral necessity.""
Amnesty International, Doctors without Borders, Human Rights Watch, Public Citizen and 11 other groups told Biden in a letter that an emergency waiver was urgently needed to combat the pandemic, noting that fewer than 7% of people in low-income countries had received a first COVID-19 shot and vaccines remained scarce.
More than 5.4 million people have died of COVID-19 around the world since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.
Biden reversed the previous U.S. position to endorse a waiver in May, a move that caught some allies by surprise, but there has been little progress since then. The European Union, Britain and Switzerland remain opposed, arguing that issuing such waivers would undercut years of investment and research.
The White House last month called on all WTO members to support a temporary waiver and WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is pushing for a deal at a WTO ministerial conference in Geneva from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3.
In their letter, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters, the rights groups said they were ""very disappointed"" that the Biden administration had not done more to secure an agreement on a waiver text since Biden's strong statement in May.
""U.S. passivity has empowered close U.S. allies - the European Union, on behalf of Germany, plus Switzerland and the United Kingdom - to block progress even as millions die or become seriously ill waiting for effective vaccines and treatments,"" the groups wrote.
They urged Biden to step up his personal engagement and lead the world in reaching a meaningful agreement on the long-standing issue. Doing so would help end the pandemic and restore U.S. standing around the world, they said.
Activists say they have gathered 3 million signatures on petitions urging Biden to step up U.S. efforts and will deliver them on Tuesday.
The White House had no immediate comment on the letter, which was dated Friday.
Ending the ministerial meeting without a waiver agreement would be entirely unacceptable,"" the groups said. They said drugmakers were using their intellectual property rights to segment global markets instead of maximizing the scale of generic production.
U.S officials oppose a separate effort to issue a ""declaration on trade and health"" led by David Walker, the New Zealand envoy to the WTO, according to a Geneva trade delegate and a second source briefed on the matter.
In their letter, the groups said the declaration, if passed without a meaningful intellectual property rights waiver, would ""further undermine the WTO's relevance and legitimacy.""",0
1001,"TOKYO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The safe-haven U.S. dollar traded close to a 16-month high to the euro on Monday on growing anxiety over the impact of surging COVID-19 infections in Europe, with Austria reimposing a full lockdown and Germany considering following suit.
The greenback was near its strongest since early October against the riskier Australian and Canadian dollars, with the commodity-linked currencies also pressured by a slump in crude oil.  read more 
The dollar got additional support from bullish comments by Federal Reserve officials Richard Clarida and Christopher Waller on Friday who suggested a faster pace of stimulus tapering may be appropriate amid a quickening recovery and heated inflation.  read more 
A more rapid end to tapering raises the possibility of  earlier interest rate increases too. Currently the market is priced for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to start hiking rates by the middle of next year.

""We expect AUD to remain heavy in the near‑term (and) a dip to $0.70 is possible,"" with a slowing Chinese economy and the Reserve Bank of Australia's dovish policy stance dragging on the currency, Joseph Capurso, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a report.
Meanwhile, ""USD can extend its recent rally this week and set a fresh 2021 high,"" he said. ""Another round of strong U.S. inflation can further propel market pricing of FOMC rate hikes and the USD.""
The minutes of the FOMC's meeting at the start of this month, when policymakers announced a start to tapering, are due Wednesday and may provide more insight on how many Fed officials are considering faster tapering or earlier rate increases.
U.S. President Joe Biden is also likely to announce his nominee for Fed chair this week, after interviewing incumbent Jerome Powell and Fed governor Lael Brainard.
""Governor Brainard is more dovish and her nomination could prompt some kneejerk USD selling,"" Westpac strategists wrote in a note.

1002,"AMSTERDAM/JOHANNESBURG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Prosus, which owns a $175 billion minority stake in Chinese internet gaming and social media group Tencent, posted an 8% rise in first-half trading profit to $2.9 billion as revenue rose rapidly in its overall portfolio.
Sometimes compared to SoftBank and its Vision Fund, Prosus NV (PRX.AS), owns stakes in a wide range of consumer internet companies, with returns from Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) dominating its overall performance.
Although its net profit spiked after Prosus booked a one-time profit of $12.3 billion on the sale of part of its Tencent stake, operating losses at businesses it controls increased.
Prosus said in a statement on Monday that revenues at its e-commerce portfolio had risen by 53% to $4.2 billion, while that segment's trading loss increased to $372 million from a loss of $214 million in the same period a year ago.
The e-commerce portfolio, which does not include returns from its holding in Tencent, spans a group of businesses that Prosus either owns or controls in classified advertising, food delivery, educational technology and fintech and payments.
Prosus estimated the market value of the e-commerce businesses at around $49 billion.
It showed better profitability in its classifieds businesses, and strong growth at its food delivery businesses, which includes iFood in Brazil and Swiggy in India.
The figures were in line with indications the company had given in a Nov. 16 pre-announcement. read more 
Bob Van Dijk, the Prosus CEO, said he did not expect China's recent moves to crack down on large technology firms to impact future earnings negatively.
""In spite of some regulation coming up ... Tencent is in my view the best-positioned internet company in the most attractive internet market in the world,"" he told reporters on a call.
In August, Prosus set up a cross-holding structure with Naspers (NPNJn.J), under which Prosus shareholders own 60% of their underlying assets but Naspers retains control. They share a single board. 
In its separate earnings report, Naspers, South Africa's largest company by market capitalization, posted half-year revenue of $17.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago. read more ",0
1003,"ZURICH, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Swiss private bank Julius Baer (BAER.S) dropped nearly 5% in early trading on Monday after it said client activity had continued to slow during the year.
The wealth manager, Switzerland's third-largest listed bank, also said margins from brokerage commissions and from financial instruments had shrunk compared to the first half of 2021.
Wealth managers enjoyed a boom during 2020 as lower consumption combined with an increase in disposable income from government transfers allowed households to save and invest more. Surging equity and housing prices also made some households wealthier.
Gross margins in the first 10 months of 2021 of 82 basis points, down from 88 basis points a year earlier, reflected what Julius Baer described as a ""softening"" in client activity from  ""exceptionally"" high levels the previous year.
""The slowdown in client activity relative to the strong first quarter of 2021 continued from the second to the third quarter and well into October,"" the bank said in a statement.
""Initial results for November, however, indicate a potential recovery for the final two months of the year,"" it added.
Shares in the bank fell 4.6% in early trading in Zurich, with Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti describing the statement as weaker than expected.
""JB guides for a potential recovery in the last two months of the year. Still, we might have to lower our estimates slightly,"" Venditti said.
Nonetheless, Julius Baer said - without giving a figure - that profitability had grown ""significantly"" during the first 10 months of 2021, due to strong growth in client assets and efficiencies, complemented by a near absence of credit losses.
Assets under management increased 12% to 484 billion Swiss francs ($520.93 billion), driven by a 4.4% increase in net new money, as well as positive stock market performance and currency movements.

1004,"STOCKHOLM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Ericsson (ERICb.ST) on Monday agreed to buy cloud communications firm Vonage (VG.O) in a $6.2 billion all-cash deal, as the telecom gear maker moves to broaden its 5G portfolio.
The deal, one of the largest in Ericsson's history, follows its $1.1 billion purchase of Cradlepoint last year which gave it access to tools that can connect devices using the so-called Internet of Things over a 4G or 5G network. 
U.S-based Vonage makes Application Programming Interface (API), which helps different software communicate with each other.
""Vonage is complementary to what we have built in enterprise so far ... Cradlepoint was one of the big stepping stones as well in building an enterprise presence,"" Ericsson CFO Carl Mellander told Reuters.
Ericsson will pay $21 for each outstanding Vonage share, a 28% premium to Friday's closing price and a 34% premium to the average of the last 3 months, a price analysts said was high.
Ericsson shares fell 3.8% in early trade, on track for their worst day since July and the worst performer on the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX).
""We see this acquisition as strengthening Ericsson's vertical integration and product offering within the cloud space, but we also deem the price-tag quite steep,"" said Danske Bank Credit Research analyst Mads Rosendal.
Vonage, which operates across sectors such as healthcare, finance, education and transportation, had sales of $1.4 billion in the 12-month period to Sept. 30, 2021, with a margin on adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of 14% and free cash flow of $109 million.
It has more than 1 million registered developers and more than 120,000 business customers.
""That's where magic happens when developers use the Vonage platform to create applications for various enterprises,"" Mellander said.
The acquisition marks a new phase after a period of restructuring and refocusing since Borje Ekholm took over as CEO in 2017.
Ericsson had branched out into multi-media in the early 2000s but struggled to fit its purchases into its operations, weighing on margins and profits.
""The transaction builds upon Ericsson's stated intent to expand globally in wireless enterprise, offering existing customers an increased share of a market valued at $700 billion by 2030,"" Ericsson said in a statement.
It said it expected the Vonage deal to boost earnings per share - excluding non-cash amortisation impacts - and free cash flow from 2024 onwards.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to Vonage shareholder approval, regulatory approvals, and other conditions.",0

Its core headline earnings per share, which strips out gains or losses from non-operational items, stood at 416 U.S. cents, versus the 376 cents per share posted a year earlier.
Naspers, Africa's biggest company by market capitalisation, has parked all its international assets, including its Tencent stake, in its Amsterdam-listed subsidiary Prosus NV (PRX.AS), , in which it holds a 57% stake.
Naspers, through Prosus, has investments spread across a multitude of online businesses including classified ads, food delivery, payments and education in countries from Brazil to India to China as well as in many parts of Europe.
However, most bring minimal revenue gains and are overshadowed by profits generated by its Tencent stake.

1008,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The world's top buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are ramping up imports of the fuel in November, with the major consumers in Asia drawing more cargoes than gas-starved Europe.
Asia's big three buyers - China, Japan and South Korea - are forecast to discharge 17.77 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel in November, according to data compiled by commodity consultants Kpler.
This is up from 15.41 million tonnes in October, and will be the highest monthly total for the world's top three buyers since February, when 19.01 million tonnes were discharged.
Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv also points to an increase in imports by China, Japan and South Korea, pegging their November imports at 16.62 million tonnes, up from 15.13 million in October.
If there is strong demand from the three major northeast Asian countries, however, the same cannot be said for buyers in South Asia, where imports have slumped amid record high spot prices.
India is on track to import just 1.51 million tonnes of LNG in November - the lowest since April 2020, at the height of the initial outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Kpler. That would be well below the 2.33 million tonnes landed in October, and a similar 2.33 million tonnes in November 2020.
Pakistan's November imports are forecast to be just 700,000 tonnes, down from 730,000 in October and the lowest monthly total since June. Bangladesh is expected to land 360,000 tonnes in November, down from October's 530,000 tonnes.
The weakness in South Asia stands in contrast to the major countries in the northeast of the region, with China forecast to import 7.37 million tonnes in November, up from 6.19 million in October and the most since January.
As an aside, Australia remains China's top LNG supplier despite tensions between Beijing and Canberra that have led to China imposing informal import bans and tariffs on a variety of Australian commodities, including coal, barley and lobsters.
China is expected to import 2.99 million tonnes of Australian LNG in November, the most since May and representing a share of just over 40% of the total.
Japan, at risk of losing the number one spot among LNG importers to China, is slated to land 6.04 million tonnes in November, up from 5.19 million in October, although down slightly from 6.3 million in November last year.
South Korea, the world's number three buyer, is forecast to import 4.36 million tonnes in November, up from 4.07 million in October and above the 3.86 million from November last year.
Overall, the picture emerging from the big three Asian buyers is one of solid demand ahead of the northern winter, but not yet reaching the peak of demand seen the previous winter, when colder-than-usual weather led to a squeeze on supplies.
PRICE HITS SOUTH ASIA
It's also clear that the surge in spot prices has curtailed demand in South Asian, with India, Pakistan and Bangladesh traditionally more exposed to the spot market.
The weekly index for LNG for delivery to north Asia  rose to $36.70 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the seven days to Nov. 19, from $31.50 previously.
While the spot index is still below the record $38.50 per mmBtu reached in the week to Oct. 15, it is now an eye-popping 473% above where it was this time last year - and 543% higher than at the same week in 2019.
Europe is still battling to secure enough natural gas for the upcoming winter, with pipeline supplies from Russia still inadequate, and the region's inventories are below the five-year average for this time of year.  read more 
Despite the potential shortage of natural gas over winter, Europe's LNG imports haven't surged, and November's arrivals are expected to be lower than those for October.
Europe will import 5.99 million tonnes of LNG in November, down from October's 6.03 million, although ahead of the 4.82 million from November last year, according to Kpler data.
Refinitiv pegs Europe's total LNG imports for November at 7.23 million tonnes in November, down from October's 7.28 million but above the 6.20 million from November last year.
The import figures do show Europe is buying more LNG than it did at this time last year. But given that 2020 was affected by the coronavirus pandemic, it may be better to look at imports from November 2019, which were 8.56 million tonnes, according to Refinitiv.",0
1009,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Gold prices were near their lowest level in two weeks on Monday, constrained by a stronger dollar and expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve would accelerate the pace of stimulus tapering to curb broadening inflationary risks.
Spot gold  was down 0.2% at $1,841.36 per ounce, as of 0650 GMT. U.S. gold futures  eased 0.3% to $1,845.20.
The metal hit its lowest level since Nov. 10 earlier in the session, after comments from Fed Vice-Chair Richard Clarida suggested the central bank would table the idea of tapering its asset purchases in its upcoming December meeting.  read more 
Higher rates generally translate into an increased opportunity cost of holding the metal, which pays no interest.
""In the short- to medium-term, gold's fundamentals look good because real (inflation-adjusted) yields are so negative, but eventually we'll get tighter monetary policy and gold will trend lower in the bigger picture,"" IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said.
""There's also a growing sense that the United States and China are going to intervene to bring oil prices lower, one of the biggest drivers of inflation expectations, and this has weighed on gold's momentum around its role as an inflation hedge.""
Further pressuring bullion was a stronger dollar index , which made bullion more expensive for holders of other currencies.
But ""with inflationary pressures reflecting only in short-dated (U.S. bond) rates, only more officials jumping on to a faster-taper narrative, or a sudden move higher in longer-term U.S. yields is likely to derail gold's rally,"" Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.
Halley said a move towards $2,000 in gold before the December Fed meeting can't be ruled out.

1010,"BENGALURU, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) fell 4.2% on Monday as India's largest firm halted a stake sale in its oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Arabia's Aramco (2222.SE) and pulled back from a potential spinoff of its most profitable unit.
The move to monetize its oil business two years ago by selling a 20% stake for roughly $15 billion to the world's biggest oil exporter was part of its plan to cut the overall debt, which stood at 2,882.43 billion rupees ($41.8 billion).
But over the last two years, while the due diligence was on, Reliance became net-debt free by selling stakes at its digital unit Jio Platforms to global companies, including Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) and venture capital arms of chipmakers Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O).
Meanwhile, as the global pandemic wreaked havoc on oil demand and prices, Reliance also sharpened its focus on renewable energy by committing $10.1 billion over three years to become a net carbon zero company by 2035.
Analysts at Jefferies said the deal cancellation may not hurt the conglomerate's balance sheet, but is disappointing as it loses a chance to set a benchmark of $75 billion valuation for the oil business.
""The market is reacting as it expected the deal to help reduce exposure to hydrocarbons business, but this has gotten delayed,"" said Sumit Pokharna, VP Research at Kotak Securities.
""However, Reliance has factors working in its favour, including a sharp recovery in refining margins, a possible hike in telecom prices and Jio subscriber additions, and a strong retail business.""
Despite the change in strategy, Reliance said on Monday Aramco would continue to be its preferred partner for investments in the private sector in India.
The company recently inducted Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan to its board amid opposition by investor California State Teachers' Retirement Fund.
Al-Rumayyan's appointment, initially seen as part of a process to formalise the stake sale, was later said to have no connection to the deal.  read more

1011,"ISLAMABAD, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Monday it had agreed with Pakistan on measures needed to revive a stalled $6 billion funding programme for the South Asian country, which faces growing economic challenges.
""The Pakistani authorities and IMF staff have reached a staff-level agreement on policies and reforms needed to complete the sixth review,"" the IMF said in a statement.
Pakistan had been in talks with the IMF for several months to seek a relaxation in the terms and conditions of the package. Its government bonds jumped between 1.3 and 2.8 cents on the dollar on the news of an agreement and were on course for their best day in over a year. ,
""The agreement is subject to approval by the Executive Board, following the implementation of prior actions, notably on fiscal and institutional reforms,"" the IMF said.
The completion of the review, pending since earlier this year, would make available 750 million in IMF special drawing rights, or around $1 billion, bringing total disbursements so far to about $3 billion, the statement said.
Pakistan will ensure legislation is passed on central bank autonomy as agreed with the IMF, said Finance Advisor Shaukat Tarin, who is equivalent to the country's finance minister.
""God willing, we will get it passed,"" he said. ""We believe that the state bank ... should be independent in monetary policy and exchange rate.""
Pakistan government has a simple majority in parliament to pass the law.
Shaukat also pledged the take another four actions as agreed before the fund's board meets to consider whether to approve the issue of the latest tranche.
Those actions are: withdrawal of tax exemptions and subsidies, an increase in the petroleum levy, higher energy tariffs and an audit of some $1.4 billion in extra funds lent to Pakistan in April 2020 to help it weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
""They have asked for it, and we have to do it,"" Shaukat told a news conference, referring to the audit. 
Pakistan entered the $6 billion, 39-month funding programme with the IMF in July 2019, but the funding stalled earlier this year due to issues over the required reforms.
Despite a difficult environment, progress continues to be made in implementing the programme, the IMF said.
""All quantitative performance criteria (PCs) for end-June were met with wide margins, except for that on the primary budget deficit,"" it said.
Pakistan has been grappling with a historical currency devaluation, high inflation, a current account deficit and dwindling foreign reserves and the talks between the government and the IMF had added to investor nerves.
""This will remove lot of uncertainties,"" a finance ministry spokesman said of the agreement with the fund.
The central bank last week warned that a higher than expected primary deficit would likely worsen the inflation outlook and undermine economic recovery. It also raised its benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 8.75% to counter inflationary pressures and preserve stability with growth.
Headline inflation had reached 9.2% in October, up from 8.4% two months earlier, the bank said.
The bank has also lifted the cash reserve requirement for commercial banks by 1 percentage point, the first such move in more than a decade, in another move to deal with accelerating inflation.",0
1012,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (APO.N) has agreed to buy a 50% stake in Broad Reach Power from its existing owners, the parties said, a deal that will result in up to $400 million of capital being invested in the U.S. energy storage and renewables company.
Founded in 2019, Broad Reach is 87.5% owned by private equity firm EnCap Investments through its energy transition fund, with the remainder held by peer Yorktown Partners and commodity trading firm Mercuria.
Apollo is paying $320 million for its Broad Reach stake, EnCap Energy Transition Managing Partner Shawn Cumberland told Reuters. EnCap will also keep $30 million of cash currently on Broad Reach's balance sheet.
As part of the deal, both Apollo and EnCap will put in up to $200 million of capital, to finance new Broad Reach projects, Cumberland added.
Houston-based Broad Reach owns or is constructing around 1.4 gigawatt hours of energy storage capacity and a 21 gigawatt portfolio of utility-scale wind, solar and energy storage projects across the United States.
While renewable power has grown to 20% of the U.S. generation mix, effective energy storage capabilities are needed so that power can be supplied when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing.
""The shift to more intermittent clean energy increases volatility and drives demand for energy storage,"" Geoff Strong, co-head of infrastructure and natural resources at Apollo, said in a statement. ""Broad Reach has a scaled, high-performing platform that is well-positioned for strong continued growth.""
The deal is the first sale for EnCap's $1.2 billion energy transition fund. It was the first fund dedicated to clean energy raised by the private equity firm - traditionally known for oil and gas investing.
Citigroup Inc (C.N) and White & Case LLP served as financial and legal advisers, respectively, to Broad Reach and EnCap. Law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP worked with Apollo.",0
1013,"BENGALURU, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Paytm (PAYT.NS) founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma urged employees to ignore the Indian payments firm's dismal market debut which he likened to challenges faced by automaker Tesla following its public listing over a decade ago, two sources told Reuters.
Shares in Paytm slumped for a second day on Monday, wiping almost $7 billion off its listing valuation of $18.74 billion in  one of the worst ever market debuts for a large Indian company.
Two sources present at an employee meeting after Paytm's market listing late last week said on Monday that Sharma - also the company's chief executive - advised employees to take solace in how Telsa (TSLA.O), once a prime target of short-sellers betting against it, is now the world's most valuable carmaker.
In the meeting that ran for more than four hours and included speeches from other business leaders, Sharma reportedly urged employees to focus on market expansion, stressing execution would predict the company's fortunes.
Paytm did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Paytm's shares fell as much as 18.57% on Monday to 1,271 rupees before recovering partially to end the day down 12.9% at 1359.60 rupees. The stock has now fallen more than 36% below its issue price of 2,150 per share.
The market rout has raised doubts around impending IPOs on the Indian market, including those of smaller rival MobiKwik and hotel aggregator OYO as valuations come under much closer investor scrutiny.  read more 
""IPOs have been running hot in India, so a correction in broader markets will hurt these stocks the most,"" said Deepak Shenoy, founder and chief executive of Capitalmind in Bengaluru.
He said people will be reluctant to come in when conditions are not favourable, raising the odds of delays in some upcoming listings.
STEEP VALUATION
Meanwhile, Paytm said on Sunday its gross merchandise value - a measure of overall sales processed via its platform - rose 131% in October from a year earlier.
The news did little to prevent a fresh sell-off as investors continued to question the company's steep valuation and business model.
Founded by Sharma in 2010 as a platform for mobile recharges, Paytm counts SoftBank (9984.T) and Ant Group among its backers and it raised some $2.5 billion in its IPO.
It grew quickly after ride-hailing firm Uber (UBER.N) made Paytm a quick payment option in India and its use swelled in late 2016 after India's shock ban on high-value currency notes boosted digital payments.
Following the listing on Thursday, Sharma told Reuters he was unperturbed by the share price slide and did not regret the  flotation.
Separately, on the day when Paytm debuted, a working group of the Indian central bank mooted setting up a self-regulatory body covering participants in digital lending. read more

1014,"ISTANBUL, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A rebound in Turkey's lira fizzled on Monday and it dipped to a fresh historic low, as analysts said emergency rate hikes would be needed soon, while speculation about a cabinet overhaul and data showing a new low in consumer confidence also weighed.
The lira ,  traded at 11.40 to the U.S. dollar at 1701 GMT, logging record lows for a tenth straight session. The currency has lost a third of its value this year.
Last Thursday, under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, the central bank cut its policy rate by 100 basis points to 15% well below inflation of nearly 20%, and signalled more easing would come.
In a news conference late on Monday, Erdogan defended the policy and said tighter monetary policy would not lower inflation, vowing to succeed in his ""economic war of independence"".
""I reject policies that will contract our country, weaken it, condemn our people to unemployment, hunger and poverty,"" Erdogan said.
The central bank has now slashed rates by 400 basis points since September in what many analysts say is a risky policy mistake. Societe Generale said it would need to deliver an ""emergency"" hike as soon as next month.
The monetary easing has ""been economically and fundamentally unjustified,"" SocGen analysts wrote in a note to clients.
""Erdogan seems to be more aggressively pursuing a strategy of 'going for growth' to reverse the decline in his popularity ratings,"" they added.
""However, the clear toll continues to be currency devaluation, higher inflation, increased strain on corporate balance sheets, risks of currency runs, higher dollarization, and financial instability,"" SocGen said.
The lira plunged some 12% last week alone, the worst performing currency globally. Its 6% crash on Thursday was the biggest since Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", sacked hawkish central bank chief Naci Agbal in March.  read more 
Erdogan has called for stimulus to boost exports, investment and jobs. The central bank says inflation pressure is temporary though likely to last through mid-2022.
Traders said the unease was heightened late last week by open speculation among politicians and investors that Erdogan might soon replace Finance and Economy Minister Lutfi Elvan, although he has not indicated any pending move.
Tim Ash, a veteran Turkey watcher at BlueBay Asset Management, speculated at the end of last week whether Elvan would still be in his post after the weekend.
""It feels a bit ominous as he has literally been the last man standing in the administration in terms of someone credible/trusted,"" Ash wrote in a note.

Analysts at MUFG bank warned that the Turkish authorities' strategy of using credit to fuel growth could misfire, creating ""a vicious cycle wherein inflation spirals into such high levels that spurs an increase in dollarisation and lira depreciation"".
Only higher interest rates are likely to break such a feedback loop, they added, predicting 300 points of hikes in the first half of next year.",0
1015,"WELLINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - New Zealand will adopt a new system of living with the coronavirus virus from Dec. 3, which will end tough restrictions and allow businesses to operate in its biggest city, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday.
New Zealand remained largely COVID-19 free until August but has been unable to beat an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant, forcing Ardern to abandon an elimination strategy and switch to treating the virus as endemic.
Its biggest city Auckland has been in lockdown for over 90 days, although some measures were eased recently.
""The hard truth is that Delta is here and not going away, but New Zealand is well set to tackle it because of our high vaccination rates and our latest safety measures including the traffic light system and Vaccine Pass,"" Ardern said in a statement.
The new system will rate regions as red, orange or green depending on their level of exposure to COVID-19 and vaccination rates. Auckland, the epicentre of the Delta outbreak, will start at red, making face masks mandatory and putting limits on gatherings at public places.
Ardern said about 83% of eligible New Zealanders are fully vaccinated, while 88% have had their first shot.
The government previously said the country would drop lockdown measures and move to the traffic-light system to manage outbreaks after 90% of the eligible population was fully vaccinated.
Along with its geographic isolation, New Zealand enforced some of the tightest pandemic restrictions among OECD nations, limiting the spread of COVID-19 and helping its economy bounce back faster than many of its peers.
The country of 5 million has so far reported about 7,000 cases in all and just 39 deaths.
Its international border is still shut and it is unclear when it will reopen.
Air New Zealand (AIR.NZ) said on Monday it has cancelled more than 1,000 flights to neighbouring Australia through to the end of the year due to border uncertainty.
New Zealand ended quarantine free travel with Australia in August after a new Delta outbreak there, and has kept its borders tightly sealed.
""This will be particularly tough news for families and friends who were hoping to catch up over Christmas,"" said Air New Zealand Chief Customer and Sales Officer Leanne Geraghty.
""Our hands are tied until border restrictions ease, and we receive further clarity from the New Zealand government.""",0
1016,"SEOUL, Nov 22 (Reuters) - For the first time since South Korea began battling its coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, all schools across the country resumed full-time in-person classes on Monday.
As the first country outside China to face a major outbreak of the virus, South Korea's schools have seen various stages of shutdowns, remote learning, and hybrid arrangements.
Widespread testing, intensive contact tracing and tracking apps have enabled South Korea to limit the spread of the virus without the extensive lockdowns seen in other countries, but previous efforts at fully opening schools have been hampered by new waves of infections.
The fully reopened schools come as part of South Korea's ""living with COVID-19"" plan, adopted after it reached its vaccination goals last month. Overall 78.8% of the population is fully vaccinated, though that number drops to 12.8% for those ages 12-17.
""It is true that many concerns remain,"" South Korean education minister Yoo Eun-hye said during a visit to an elementary school in Seoul on Monday.
Even as it eased social distancing amid high vaccination rates, the country has battled some of the highest daily case numbers yet, including a record number of severe cases.
South Korea reported 2,827 new COVID-19 cases as of midnight Sunday, down slightly from nearly a week of daily totals over 3,000, including a record high 3,292 new cases on Thursday.
Most worrisome for health officials is an uptick in serious cases requiring hospitalization, which have lingered near record highs of more than 500.
Schools still can move back to remote learning or other hybrid arrangements if the coronavirus situation requires it. Precautions such as masks, dividers and other distancing measures remain in place.
“As the number of new confirmed cases increase, we ask parents and family members to pay extra attention to prevention measures,"" Yoo said. ""The education ministry and education offices will thoroughly check the prevention measures and will support areas in need.""",0

Benchmark copper  on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.6% at $9,705 a tonne at 1707 GMT. Prices of the metal used in the power and construction industries have mostly traded in a narrow $400 dollar range in recent weeks.
""We should be cautious, China's property slowdown is worrying, it is dragging down base metals,"" said Dan Smith, Managing Director at consultancy Commodity Market Analytics.
""Copper inventories are low, but the mining side is starting to ramp up. We are going from a market in deficit to a market that will be in balance over the next three to six months.""
PROPERTY: China's property market, accounting for a quarter of gross domestic product by some metrics, has slowed sharply since May, with sentiment shaken by a growing liquidity crisis.  read more 
MINING: The Kamoa-Kakula project in the Democratic Republic of Congo is starting to ramp up. It produced 41,545 tonnes of copper concentrate in the third quarter, with year-to-date production of more than 77,500 tonnes as of Nov. 15.
DOLLAR: A stronger U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated metals more expensive for holders of other currencies, which can subdue demand.
INVENTORIES: Copper stocks  in LME-registered warehouses are at 86,525 tonnes, about a third of the level in late August.
Cancelled warrants -- metal earmarked for delivery -- at 28% suggest another 24,175 tonnes is due to leave LME warehouses.

The deal, subject to regulatory approvals, will see Telenor and CP Group each owning a third of the combined company, with stock market investors holding the rest.
The partnership will arm the two companies better against current market leader Advanced Info Service Pcl (AIS) (ADVANC.BK) and give them deeper pockets to face mounting investment costs for 5G.
Telenor will merge its majority-owned Total Access Communication (Dtac) (DTAC.BK) with CP Group's True Corporation (TRUE.BK) at an exchange ratio of 10.221 True shares per Dtac share.  read more 
Telenor and CP Group will have equal influence over the new business, the Norwegian firm's CEO said.
""When we now do this, we give up a majority control over the company we have,"" Sigve Brekke told Reuters. ""Therefore, it is important for us to make a company where there are equal partnerships, as in, the two big owners have the same shareholder position,"" he said.
The news comes months after Thai power producer Gulf Energy Development (GULF.BK) offered to buy Intouch Holdings (INTUCH.BK), which controls AIS, though Gulf Energy has only managed to raise its stake in Intouch to 42.3% so far.
Telenor and CP Group's merged company will have ""revenue market share in the low 40% that is similar to AIS,"" Brekke told media. ""AIS is still a big brother when it comes to profitability so we will learn as we go.""
The tie-up between True and Dtac is set to become the third biggest merger deal between Thai companies, according to Refinitiv data. The combined firm will be listed on the Thai stock exchange.
""Telenor's decision to amalgamate its Thailand holdings with True is hardly surprising, given its ASEAN subsidiary's M&As and exits,"" analyst Thapana Phanich said in a co-branded research report from Jefferies and TISCO Securities, referring to a similar deal struck in Malaysia earlier this year.  read more 
""Dtac has little hope of beating its rivals, or even surviving, in the long run"".

""We are positive that we will reach regulatory approval,"" she said.
The offer of 47.76 baht ($1.45) per Dtac share represents a premium of 15.8% to its Friday close and the offer of 5.09 baht ($0.1549) per True Corp share represents a premium of 17.8% to its close on the same day.
Telenor plans to inject between $300 million and $500 million into the new firm to help pay minority shareholders of Dtac and True who decide to opt for cash rather than stock.
CP Group will also inject cash, albeit a smaller amount, Telenor said, ensuring the two end up holding equal stakes.
Meanwhile, Telenor will continue to look for merger opportunities in Asia, including in Pakistan and on a regional basis, Brekke said.
Dtac and True Corp shares rose 9.1% and 10.2%, respectively, on Monday, while the benchmark Thai index (.SETI) was up 0.3%. Telenor was up 1.7% in Oslo at 1156 GMT.

Following an official review, James was assessed a 'Flagrant two penalty', resulting in his ejection for the second time in his 19-year career. His first ejection came in November 2017 against the Miami Heat.
Stewart was also ejected, while Lakers guard Russell Westbrook was handed a technical foul for his involvement in the scrap following the incident.
Pistons head coach Dwane Casey said Stewart received eight stitches and hoped the center would be spared a possible suspension.
""He shouldn't be facing anything,"" Casey said. ""Not getting off the court in time? The league will have to decide that.
""But the man got eight stitches, whatever it is, across his forehead. He was upset. Blood running down his face. I don't see any ramifications from the league from that standpoint.""
Lakers forward Anthony Davis defended James, saying the collision wasn't intentional.
""Everyone in the league knows LeBron is not a dirty guy,"" Davis said, adding that James was attempting to apologise to Stewart immediately after the foul before things kicked off.
""We're not promoting violence. I'm not promoting violence.""
After trailing in the third quarter, the Lakers bounced back in the fourth quarter to seal a win in Detroit and end their three-game losing streak.",0
1026,"CHICAGO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures rallied to their highest in nearly nine years on Monday as ill-timed rains in Australia and rising Russian wheat prices stoked concerns about tightening supplies among the world's top exporters.
Corn and soybeans followed wheat higher, with additional support from a waning U.S. harvest and strong domestic demand from ethanol makers and soy processors.
""The demand continues to equal or outstrip the supply in the short term,"" said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities.
""The wheat market's leading the charge. It was hit with weather that is too wet in Australia and a little too dry in the U.S. Plains, shipping issues in southwest Canada and issues around export taxes in Russia,"" Roose said.
Chicago Board of Trade March soft red winter wheat  was up 23-1/4 cents at $8.57-1/2 a bushel after peaking at $8.59-1/2, the highest for a most-active contract  since December 2012. All futures months hit new contract highs.
K.C. hard red winter wheat futures also posted across-the-board contract highs, with the March contract  ending 28 cents higher at $8.66-1/2 a bushel.
Wheat prices in Russia rose for a fifth straight week last week on strong demand. Shipments from the world's largest exporter are down 34% this season due to a smaller crop and rising export taxes. 
Heavy rains, meanwhile stalled harvesting in Australia and threatened crop quality, while flooding in western Canada has disrupted exports when global demand for wheat has risen.
Robust domestic demand for corn and soybeans amid strong margins at ethanol plants and soy crush facilities underpinned futures prices.

1027,"BANGKOK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Thailand's unemployment rate hit a more than 16-year high in the third quarter, as tougher coronavirus restrictions hit economic activity and jobs, the state planning agency said on Monday.
The curbs were eased from September, however, and the Southeast Asian country earlier this month reopened to vaccinated foreign visitors without quarantine requirements, in a bid to restart its important tourism sector.
The unemployment rate jumped to 2.25% in the September quarter, representing 870,000 workers without jobs, from 1.89% in the previous three months, the agency said in a statement.
The jobless rate was 2.52% in the first quarter of 2005.
Thailand's definition of unemployed is quite narrow, including only those who do not work a single hour in a surveyed week. It excludes owners of businesses or farms, while analysts note it does not catch the significant unofficial economy.
Earlier, the central bank said jobless numbers were expected at 3.4 million at the end of 2021.
In the third quarter, overall employment dropped 0.6% from a year earlier to 37.7 million workers, with the hotel/restaurant and construction sectors losing the most jobs, it said.
The strict COVID-19 measures had a significant impact on the labour market,"" Danucha Pichayanan, head of the National Economic and Social Development Council, told a news conference.
The easing of curbs and the reopening should increase employment in tourism, but the country will need more measures to help businesses with jobs, he said.

1030,"MIZATA, El Salvador, Nov 20 (Reuters) - (This November 20 story corrects to show Blockstream executive Samson Mow talking about the possibility of 100 countries issuing bitcoin-backed bonds rather than 10 after company said he had misspoken and issued a correction.)
El Salvador plans to build the world's first ""Bitcoin City"", funded initially by bitcoin-backed bonds, President Nayib Bukele said on Saturday, doubling down on his bet to harness the crypto currency to fuel investment in the Central American country.
Speaking at an event closing a week-long promotion of bitcoin in El Salvador, Bukele said the city planned in the eastern region of La Union would get geothermal power from a volcano and not levy any taxes except for value added tax (VAT).
""Invest here and make all the money you want,"" Bukele said in English, dressed all in white and wearing a reversed baseball cap, in the beach resort of Mizata. ""This is a fully ecological city that works and is energized by a volcano.""
Half of the VAT levied would be used to fund the bonds issued to build the city, and the other half would pay for services such as garbage collection, Bukele said, estimating the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 bitcoins.
El Salvador in September became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.
Although Bukele is a popular president, opinion polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about his love of bitcoin, and its bumpy introduction has fueled protests against the government.
Likening his plan to cities founded by Alexander the Great, Bukele said Bitcoin City would be circular, with an airport, residential and commercial areas, and feature a central plaza designed to look like a bitcoin symbol from the air.
""If you want bitcoin to spread over the world, we should build some Alexandrias,"" said Bukele, a tech savvy 40-year-old who in September proclaimed himself ""dictator"" of El Salvador on Twitter in an apparent joke.
El Salvador planned to issue the initial bonds in 2022, Bukele said, suggesting it would be in 60 days time.
Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain technology provider Blockstream, told the gathering the first 10-year issue, known as the ""volcano bond"", would be worth $1 billion, backed by bitcoin and carrying a coupon of 6.5%. Half of the sum would go to buying bitcoin on the market, he said. Other bonds would follow.
After a five year lock-up, El Salvador would start selling some of the bitcoin used to fund the bond to give investors an ""additional coupon"", Mow said, positing that the value of the crypto currency would continue to rise robustly.
""This is going to make El Salvador the financial center of the world,"" he said.
The bond would be issued on the ""liquid network"", a bitcoin sidechain network. To facilitate the process, El Salvador's government is working on a securities law, and the first license to operate an exchange would go to Bitfinex, Mow said.
Crypto exchange Bitfinex was listed as the book runner for the bond on a presentation behind Mow.
Once 10 such bonds were issued, $5 billion in bitcoin would be taken off the market for several years, Mow said. ""And if you get 100 more countries to do these bonds, that's half of bitcoin's market cap right there.""
The ""game theory"" on the bonds gave first issuer El Salvador an advantage, Mow argued, saying: ""If bitcoin at the five-year mark reaches $1 million, which I think it will, they will sell bitcoin in two quarters and recoup that $500 million.""",0

1033,"TAIPEI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Over the past six years, Taiwanese luger Li Sin-rong has sped down sloping roads and mountain highways on her duct-taped green sled - using wheels, not blades - in hopes of securing a place at the 2022 Winter Olympics.
Winter athletes on the subtropical island often travel to training facilities abroad, but COVID-19 restrictions have limited the amount of time Li, 23, and 19-year-old alpine skier Lee Win-yi, have been able to practice on ice and snow.
The two women have instead relied heavily on alternative training arrangements in Taiwan as they prepared for qualifying competitions.
""From the start, we knew it would be very hard to stand on the awards podium. We just want to stand on the starting platform,"" Lee said. ""Most athletes are charging towards first place, but we just want a spot.""
Lee grew up in a skiing family. Her father, Ader, was one of Taiwan's few professional skiers, but missed his chance to compete in the Olympics because of mandatory military service. He now runs an indoor ski training centre, where his daughter trains on machines that simulate ski runs.
""For Taiwan's skiing circle, attending the Winter Olympics has been a long-held hope. It has already been 30 years,"" Ader said, referring to the last Taiwanese skier to compete in the Olympics. ""So everyone is forging ahead in this direction.""
Li won't find out whether she qualifies for Beijing until late December at the earliest, and Lee not until mid-January. At the last Winter Games in 2018, Taiwan only sent four athletes, who won no medals.
Indeed, Taiwan, where snow brushes only the highest mountaintops during the coldest winters, has never won a medal at the Winter Olympics.
If Lee and Li compete, they would be on the ""Chinese Taipei"" team at the insistence of Beijing, which sees democratically governed Taiwan as part of ""one China"".
Taiwan's best Olympic performance - in August in Tokyo - revived an old debate over whether the island should compete under the name ""Taiwan"" and saw a surge in pride at being Taiwanese.
Although neither athlete wanted to talk directly about the issue, they both said they are proud to represent their homeland.
""I really hope to let the world see Taiwan,"" Li said.",0
1034,"CANBERRA/SYDNEY, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Australia will allow foreign visa holders to enter the country from the start of December, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday, the latest step to restart international travel and support its economy.
Australia shut its international border in May 2020 and allowed only restricted numbers of citizens and permanent residents to enter in a bid to curtail the spread of COVID-19.
The rules were relaxed in recent weeks to allow foreign family members of citizens to enter, and Morrison said this will be scaled up from Dec. 1 to allow vaccinated students, business visa holders and refugees to arrive.
""The return of skilled workers and students to Australia is a major milestone in our pathway back,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. Australia will also allow in vaccinated tourists from South Korea and Japan from Dec 1, he said.
The return of foreign students, who are worth about A$35 billion ($25 billion) a year to the Australian economy, will be a major boost for the education sector.
More than 235,000 foreigners, including about 160,000 students, held visas for Australia at the end of October, government data showed.
Many Australian universities have come to rely on foreign students, who make up about 21% of total enrolments, and the border closure led higher education facilities to lay off hundreds of staff.
Many students locked out of Australia have said they would switch to alternative universities if they were unable to begin face-to-face learning in 2022.  read more 
The relaxation of the border rules is also expected to ease labour shortages, which threaten to stymie an economic rebound.
""This will be critical relief for businesses who are struggling to find workers just to keep their doors open and for those who need highly specialised skills to unlock big projects,"" said Jennifer Westacott, chief executive of the industry body, the Business Council.
Border rules, swift lockdowns and tough social distancing rules helped Australia to keep its coronavirus numbers far lower than many other comparable countries, with around 200,000 cases and 1,948 deaths.
Most new infections are being reported in Victoria state, which logged 1,029 cases on Monday. New South Wales, home to Sydney, reported 180 cases. Other states and territories are COVID-free or have very few cases.

MERCEDES (Lewis Hamilton 1, Valtteri Bottas retired)
Hamilton led from pole to take his 102nd career victory and seventh of the season. He is now eight points behind Verstappen. This was the 30th circuit he was won at. Bottas started sixth, after a three place penalty for failing to respect warning flags in qualifying, and dropped to 11th at the start. He had a front-left puncture on lap 33, limped back to the pits but retired on lap 48 due to the damage. Mercedes are now only five points clear of Red Bull.
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 2, Sergio Perez 4)
Verstappen started seventh, after a five place grid penalty for failing to slow for yellow flags in qualifying, but was fourth at the end of lap one and second after five laps. He took a bonus point for fastest lap. Perez started 11th and might have been on the podium but for a switch to two stops and then the virtual safety car. Team boss Horner was handed an official warning for comments about a marshal, and apologised.
FERRARI (Carlos Sainz 7, Charles Leclerc 8)
Sainz started fifth after penalties for Bottas and Verstappen and did a one stop strategy. Both Ferrari drivers had to do a lot of tyre management. Leclerc started with a new chassis in 13th place. Ferrari double-stacked the drivers at the pitstop. They now lead McLaren by 39.5 points.
MCLAREN (Lando Norris 9, Daniel Ricciardo 12)
Norris started fourth and had good pace until a puncture wrecked his race and dropped him down from fourth with seven laps to go. The hard tyre that went in the second stint had done fewer laps than the soft in the first. Ricciardo started 14th, had a good first stint and then had to save fuel.
ALPINE (Fernando Alonso 3, Esteban Ocon 5)
Alonso secured his first podium since 2014, when he was at Ferrari. He started third after penalties to Verstappen and Bottas and was second after the first corner but could not ultimately hold off Verstappen. He returned to third place after Perez pitted for a second time. Ocon moved up four places from his grid position. Renault-owned Alpine started the race level on points with AlphaTauri and are now 25 clear.
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 11, Yuki Tsunoda 13)
Gasly started on the front row but lacked the speed to compete at the front. The team tried an aggressive two stop strategy but that did not work either. Tsunoda struggled on the soft tyre and was also slowed on the first stint when a visor tear-off became stuck on the rear wing, forcing an earlier pitstop to remove it.
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 6, Sebastian Vettel 10)
Stroll started 12th and made a strong start, undercutting Sainz at the pitstop. Both were on a one-stop. Vettel started 10th but dropped to 17th after being pushed wide by Bottas but made a strong recovery. This was the team's first double-points finish since France in June.
WILLIAMS (George Russell 17, Nicholas Latifi retired)
Latifi retired on lap 51 due to a puncture, bringing out the virtual safety car when he parked up by the side of the track and marshals had to come out to remove it. Russell started 15th and made an early stop on lap 17 and then had to pit again on lap 49 after a left-front puncture.
ALFA ROMEO (Kimi Raikkonen 14, Antonio Giovinazzi 15)
Both did a two-stop strategy. Giovinazzi gained four places at the start.

Schumacher started 19th and did a one-stop strategy, as did Mazepin, who had completed only 15 laps in practice and qualifying due to chassis problems.",0

Brent crude  futures rose 81 cents, or 1%, to settle at $79.70 a barrel. WTI crude  futures rose 81 cents, or 1%, to settle at $76.75 a barrel.
Prices of the Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude benchmarks fell more than $1 in early trading, hitting their lowest levels since Oct. 1.
Japanese and Indian officials are working on ways to release national reserves of crude oil in tandem with the United States and other major economies to dampen prices, seven government sources with knowledge of the plans told Reuters.  read more 
Such an announcement could come as early as Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the discussions, but White House and U.S. energy department officials said no official decision on a release had been made.  read more 
The discussions have come after the U.S. government was unable to persuade the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, to pump more oil with major producers arguing the world was not short of crude.
The producer group agreed this month to stick to plans to raise oil output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) from December.
Oil prices rose after Bloomberg News reported that OPEC+ may alter plans to keep boosting production, citing delegates. Reuters has not verified the report.
""OPEC is sending a signal that if these players do this, they have some barrels they can withhold and will offset the impact of a release,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures in Chicago.
Joseph McMonigle, secretary general of the Riyadh-based International Energy Forum, said on Monday he expects OPEC+ to maintain its plan of adding supplies to the market gradually.
""I see them sticking to their current plan in light of the supply surplus for next year, which is typical for oil markets in the first quarter,"" he said. ""If they are going to make a change, it will be because of unforeseen external factors, such as these lockdowns in Europe, any kind of strategic release, and shifts in jet fuel demand.""
Any SPR release would only affect prices for two or three weeks, said Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of consultancy Facts Global Energy.
Citigroup analysts estimated in a note that the United States could release anywhere from 45 million to 60 million barrels from its reserves that would bring forward about 20 million in already approved sales. The bank said a combined release could be at ""on the order of 100-120 million bbls or higher.""
""An SPR release should now be somewhat priced in, although a larger-than-expected volume could well add further downside pressure to markets; on the other hand, if no SPR release takes place, disappointing market expectations, prices could rebound higher given still-low inventories for crude and products,"" they wrote.
Worries about demand have been fed by the prospect of national lockdowns in Europe, which has pressured prices.

1037,"CARACAS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) awarded victory to the ruling Socialist party in 20 governorships and three to opposition politicians in an initial announcement on Monday following local and regional elections.
Shortly after the first results were published, leftist President Nicolas Maduro celebrated the government's triumph.
""The victory is impressive,"" Maduro said, surrounded by supporters, adding that ""good wins must be celebrated.""
The results are a setback for the opposition leaders who returned to the fray after boycotting presidential polls in 2018 and congressional elections in 2020, arguing that a fair vote was impossible due to rigging and intimidation by violent gangs loyal to Maduro.
This year, the opposition politicians decided to contest the elections as they were frustrated by the failure of U.S. sanctions to dislodge Maduro, as well as emboldened by the presence of election observers from the European Union.
Only 41.8% of registered voters turned out to cast their ballot on Sunday, equivalent to some 8.1 million people, the South American country's top electoral authority said.
""Small and isolated problems"" were registered during the course of voting, the CNE said earlier in the day.
In 2017's regional elections the ruling party won 19 governorships, while opposition politicians took four.
The only mayoral result announced in the CNE's first bulletin came from the capital Caracas - where the ruling party was also declared the victor.
Citizens cast their votes for over 3,000 state governors, mayors and city councils across the country, with 21 million Venezuelans registered to take part in the elections.
'LAMENTABLE FOR THE OPPOSITION'
The poor performance by the opposition could hurt its ability to contest the presidential elections in 2024.
""This result is lamentable for the opposition,"" Luis Vicente Leon, director of local consulting firm Datanalisis, said in a post on Twitter.
Opposition leader and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, who led the opposition campaign, said via Twitter that an assessment will be made when all the results are in and did not give further details.
""The takeaway from these results is that we must rethink our strategy so far,"" Tomas Guanipa, the opposition candidate for the mayor of Caracas, said.

For four years, Lee lived in a studio apartment in Jeonju, a city of 658,000, on weekdays, and traveled back to Seoul for the weekend. She feared her family would break up if she didn't make the hard decision to quit.
Lee is one of some 140 money managers who has left the 930.5 trillion won ($788 billion) National Pension Service since 2016, shortly before it moved to Jeonju, a sleepy provincial capital, as part of the government's relocation of major agencies away from the capital Seoul.
That is almost half the 320 currently working at the fund's investment arm, an alarming brain drain for the main public retirement plan of Asia's fourth-largest economy and a major investor in Korean blue-chips such as Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Hyundai Motor Co. (035420.KS).

Over the past five years, however, the NPS has only filled 57% of jobs it opened.
An NPS official said that partly reflects the greater number of openings as the fund grows investments but acknowledged the issues around the relocation.
""Although it has stabilised a lot compared to before our relocation to Jeonju, the issue regarding manpower seems to have re-emerged because we recently increased job openings in a large scale which seemingly pushed up the relative vacancy rate,"" the official told Reuters in response to queries.
""As our overseas investment expands, so are opportunities to work abroad, and efforts are being made to motivate talent to stay in service by improving working conditions, and we also have talent development programmes.""
To plug staff shortages, it removed the mandatory one-year work experience requirement for the first time from its job postings in September and began offering opportunities to work abroad, even to domestic equity fund managers.
The NPS's annualised investment return for 2020 was 9.7%, below 25.15% for Japan's GPIF in fiscal 2020 and 20.4% at Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
That partly reflects the more conservative nature of its investments, fund managers say, which also means it is less exposed during downturns.
However, the NPS now plans to expand its overseas investment allocations to 50% by 2024 from 34% in 2019 .
It has 30 staff across branches in New York, London and Singapore as of 2020, far fewer than the 351 staff at Canada's CPPIB and 252 at Norway's NBIM in their various overseas offices, 2020 data from the NPS shows.
More ambitious returns would demand a deeper pool of investment talent, which has become harder to attract and retain since the relocation in 2017.
""When I was a manager there about eight to 10 applicants used to compete for one fund manager position, after we screened out inexperienced ones, and that's when the fund's pay level was even lower,"" said Hong Chun-uk, who resigned from a senior fund manager position at the NPS in 2015.
He left the fund after it announced its relocation and has since become an economist at Seoul-based brokerage.
BIG MONEY, SMALL TOWN
The NPS is one of about 150 state agencies and public corporations that have moved out of Seoul since 2005, with another batch of about 100 institutions, including part of the National Assembly, also planned for relocation.
The major shift was part of a government plan to decentralise economic and political power away from Seoul, ease congestion in the capital and develop regional cities.
The struggle to fill roles at the fund has fueled debate over the merits of relocating crucial public institutions.
Two fund managers who left the NPS said the brain drain issue hasn't adversely affected the fund's performance yet but pension experts say it will.
""In Korea, there's strong preference to live in the capital Seoul, among families, for schools and lifestyle,"" Yun Suk-myung, head of the Korean Pension Association said. ""Obviously the political push ignored that and having inexperienced, incompetent fundies will eventually hurt its investment returns.""
For many fund managers used to a certain standard of urban living, Jeonju has its limitations.
""There is one popular restaurant I went to often and I used to meet my boss and folks from other teams all there,"" Lee said. ""Everyone at the NPS kind of expects colleagues to be around the town.""",0
1039,"MELBOURNE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has made its first foray into selling power to households in Australia, teaming up with an infrastructure fund to buy Meridian Energy's (MEL.NZ) local electricity business for A$729 million ($528 million).
The deal, which follows Shell's acquisition of the country's biggest power supplier to commercial businesses in 2019, is in line with its plans to double the amount of power it sells globally to retail and business customers by 2030 to around 560 terawatt hours a year.
""Our aim is to become a leading provider of clean power-as-a-service and this acquisition broadens our customer portfolio in Australia to include households,"" Elisabeth Brinton, Shell's executive vice president of renewables and energy Solutions, said in a statement.
Meridian's local electricity and gas retail business has more than 185,000 customers. It is Australia's 10th largest electricity retailer with roughly a 1% residential market share, according to consumer comparison firm Canstar Blue.
Infrastructure Capital Group will acquire Meridian's 300 megawatts of Australian power assets - which include wind farms and hydropower - as well as a wind farm development project and an energy storage project. Shell has agreed to buy all of the output from the producing assets.
Shell and ICG did not disclose how much each was putting towards the acquisition.
The deal expands ICG's renewable generation capacity under management by more than 50% to 875 MW.
""Not only does this significantly scale our renewables portfolio but the addition of hydro comes at an important stage as we look to diversify with well-established, well-located assets,"" ICG Managing Director Tom Laidlaw said in a statement.
Meridian put the business up for sale this year and attracted bids from Spain's Iberdrola SA (IBE.MC) and Italy's Enel SpA (ENEI.MI) among others, according to Australian media.
The deal is expected to close in early 2022 pending foreign investment approval from the Australian government.

1040,"TRIPOLI, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Libya's interim prime minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah registered as a candidate for the presidency on Sunday despite having vowed not to do so as a condition of taking his current post and despite contested election rules that may prevent him from standing.
Dbeibah's entry into a race that now features many of Libya's main players of the past decade of chaos adds to the turmoil over a vote that is due to take place within five weeks, but for which rules have not yet been agreed.
Parliamentary and presidential elections on Dec. 24 were demanded by a U.N. political forum last year as part of a roadmap to end Libya's civil war, a process that also led to the formation of Dbeibah's interim unity government.
Libya has had little stability since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ousted Muammar Gaddafi as the country fragmented among myriad armed groups. Government was split in 2014 between warring rival administrations based in east and west.
However, the disputes over the election threaten to derail the U.N.-backed peace process that emerged last year after the collapse of an eastern military offensive to seize the capital Tripoli.
The elections are being organised under a law issued by parliament speaker Aguila Saleh in September that set a first-round presidential vote for Dec. 24 but that delayed the parliamentary election to January or February.
Dbeibah and some major political figures and groupings in western Libya have criticised Saleh's election law, saying it was passed improperly, and have called for both votes to be delayed until there is agreement on the rules.
The electoral commission and Libyan courts are likely to rule on the eligibility of candidates in the coming weeks - a process that may itself stir new disputes.
DISPUTES
Dbeibah is likely to be a frontrunner in the election after implementing a series of populist spending measures in recent months including infrastructure projects and payments to support young newlyweds.
The 63-year old hails from one of Libya's wealthiest business families, but he was not a prominent figure in his own right before the U.N. political forum chose him to lead the interim government overseeing the run-up to elections.
As prime minister, he has pledged investment in Libyan regions that suffered neglect during the past decade of chaos, agreed major contracts with countries involved on both sides of the civil war and courted young people with financial support.
He has not yet said publicly why he has chosen to break the televised promise he made when he was appointed that he would play no role in the election.
Saleh's law might also rule him out as a candidate because it requires him to step down from his position three months before the vote, which he did not do.
His best-known rivals include Gaddafi's son and one-time heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the commander of the eastern forces in the civil war Khalifa Haftar, and Saleh himself.
Gaddafi and Haftar are both accused of war crimes, which they deny, and would be seen in swathes of Libya as unacceptable after years of warfare.",0
1041,"WARSAW/VILNIUS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki warned on Sunday that the migrant crisis on the Belarus border may be a prelude to ""something much worse"", and Poland's border guard said Belarusian forces were still ferrying migrants to the frontier.
The European Union accuses Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to cross into EU and NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, in response to European sanctions.
Minsk, which denies fomenting the crisis, cleared a migrant camp near the border on Thursday and started to repatriate some people to Iraq, while Poland and Lithuania reported lower numbers of attempts to cross their borders in recent days.
But Morawiecki warned the crisis was far from over as he toured Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia on Sunday to discuss the situation.
A poll published by Poland's Rzeczpospolita daily on Sunday said 55% of Poles are worried the crisis on the border could escalate into an armed conflict.
""I think that the things that unfold before our eyes, these dramatic events, may only be a prelude to something much worse,"" Morawiecki said in Vilnius.
He pointed to increased Russian military presence close to Ukraine, as well as in Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad enclave which borders Poland and Lithuania, as ""an instrument which could be used directly for a direct attack"".
The situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover ""may be used as the next stage of the migration crisis,"" said Morawiecki.
CALLS FOR SUPPORT
Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte warned European partners to not ignore Belarus' neighbours, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel twice called Lukashenko looking for solution of the humanitarian crisis.
""For us, it is very important that any talks (with Belarus) are coordinated with Lithuania, Poland and Latvia, which are at the forefront of the hybrid attack, and no decisions are taken which do not solve the situation fundamentally"", she said after meeting with Morawiecki on Sunday.
France's foreign minister said on Sunday that Russia had to exert pressure on its ally, Belarus, to end the migrant crisis.
FORCIBLY BROUGHT TO BORDER
Poland says Minsk continues to truck hundreds of foreigners to the frontier, where about 10 migrants are believed to have died with a frigid winter setting in.
""On Saturday ... a group of about 100 very aggressive foreigners, brought to the border by Belarusian servicemen, tried to enter Poland by force,"" the border guard said on Twitter on Sunday.
A dozen migrants from Iraq, speaking with Lithuanian news portal DELFI over the border with Belarus on Saturday, said they were forcibly brought there in military trucks by Belarus officials, who ignored their wish to go back to Iraq.
Hundreds of Poles took part in protests on Saturday to demand help for the migrants. The Catholic church organised a fundraiser on Sunday to collect money for those in need at the border and support the integration of refugees who will stay in Poland.",0
1042,"VIENNA, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Belarusian opposition leader in exile Svetlana Tikhanouskaya urged Austria's government and Austrian companies present in Belarus to do more to help her allies against President Alexander Lukashenko in remarks published on Sunday.
Her comments in a joint interview with Austrian newspapers Kleine Zeitung and Die Presse come on the eve of a video conference hosted by Austria in support of Belarusian civil society in the face of a crackdown on opposition by Lukashenko's government. Tikhanouskaya helped organise the conference.
Austrian companies are among the most important European Union firms in Belarus. Raiffeisen Bank International's (RBIV.VI) Priorbank is the fourth-biggest bank in the country in terms of loans, and phone operator A1 Telekom Austria (TELA.VI) has a share of roughly 42% of its mobile market.
""We understand that large companies like A1 do not want to give up their business activities in our country,"" Tikhanouskaya said.
""However, they could make their presence subject to certain conditions and make clear that their employees cannot be thrown in prison simply because they have a different opinion to Lukashenko.""
Austria could take in students expelled from university in Belarus, she added.
Lukashenko claimed a resounding victory in last year's presidential election despite the widely held view that the vote was fraudulent. Various opposition groups say Tikhanouskaya won.
The resulting crackdown has involved hundreds thrown in prison, allegations that opposition activists were tortured, and spurred a lively opposition movement in countries like Latvia, Lithuania and Germany where many Belarusians live.
In the latest confrontation between the EU and Minsk since the election, Europe accuses Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to cross the Polish border into the EU.  read more 
Monday's conference, which was switched to a virtual format because Austria is going into a COVID-19 lockdown that day, is due to feature the foreign ministers of Germany, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia and Slovakia. The Belarusian government declined to take part.

1043,"LONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Globalisation is alive and well in the boardrooms of Europe’s investment banks. UBS (UBSG.S) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) on Saturday and Friday respectively nominated an Irishman and a Dutchman as their new chairs. The Swiss bank’s pick, former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) President Colm Kelleher, ticks more boxes than the German lender’s choice of Alexander Wynaendts, previously the boss of insurer Aegon (AEGN.AS).
Kelleher has the right résumé for the world’s largest wealth manager. He was pivotal in the Wall Street firm’s strategic swivel towards the business after the 2008 financial crisis. His last role involved getting private bankers and dealmakers to work together, a central task for UBS. Doing it better could narrow the $60 billion bank’s valuation gap with Morgan Stanley, which is valued at 2.4 times its forward tangible book value, more than double UBS’s multiple.
The appointment breaks an unwritten rule that one of UBS’s two top jobs should go to a Swiss national: Kelleher will work alongside Dutch CEO Ralph Hamers. But Vice Chair Lukas Gaehwiler is well-known in Zurich. In any case, UBS earned almost twice as much revenue in the Americas last year as it did at home.
Wynaendts is a less obvious choice for Deutsche. The Dutchman’s last banking job ended in 1997. Admittedly, he has served on Citigroup’s (C.N) board since 2019, and insurers are major counterparties for fixed-income traders, one of the German group’s most important businesses. Deutsche’s retail bankers will also be pleased to learn that a key strategic push at Aegon was upgrading IT systems to make better use of customer data.
Even so, Wynaendts will be a newcomer to Germany’s clubby financial establishment. Deutsche’s home market is also more important, bringing in almost twice as much revenue last year as the Americas. One of the key questions facing Deutsche is whether to revive a merger with state-backed Commerzbank. The country’s likely next chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was heavily involved in the last attempt. Deutsche CEO Christian Sewing and Vice Chair Norbert Winkeljohann will have to do the heavy lifting on government relations.
Wynaendts was partly selected because of his M&A experience at Aegon, which bought and sold businesses during his tenure. He’ll face a steep learning curve in Frankfurt.

1044,"AMSTERDAM, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Riots broke out in cities across the Netherlands on Sunday, the third night in a row that police clashed with mobs of angry youths who set fires and threw rocks to protest COVID-19 restrictions.
Unrest was reported in locations including Leeuwarden and Groningen in the north, the eastern town of Enschede and Tilburg in the south. In Enschede, where an emergency ordinance was issued, police used batons to try to disperse a crowd, according to video on social media. In Leeuwarden, police vans were pelted with rocks and black-clad groups chanted and set off flares.
Responding to the worst disturbances since a full lockdown led to widespread disorder and more than 500 arrests in January, police said five officers had been injured overnight Saturday and at least 64 people detained in three provinces, including dozens who threw fireworks and fences during a soccer match at Feyenoord Rotterdam's stadium.
The latest unrest began on Friday night in Rotterdam, where police opened fire on a crowd that had swelled to hundreds during a protest that the city's mayor said had turned into ""an orgy of violence"".
Four people believed to have been hit by police bullets remained in hospital on Sunday, a statement by the authorities said.  read more 
The protests were sparked by opposition to government plans to restrict use of a national corona pass to people who have either recovered from COVID-19 or have been vaccinated, excluding those with a negative test result.
The Netherlands reimposed some lockdown measures on its 17.5 million population last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of the virus, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic.  read more 
Some youths were also angered by a New Year's Eve firework ban to avoid added pressure on hospitals that have already been forced to scale back care due to a surge in COVID-19 patients.  read more 
Among the most serious confrontations on Saturday night were those in The Hague, where the five officers were hurt, one of them seriously, a police statement said. Police carried out charges on horseback and arrested 19 people, one of them for throwing a rock through the window of a passing ambulance.",0

Local TV station Fox 35 was first to report the news, citing a cast member at the resort complex.
A Disney spokesperson had earlier told Reuters by email: ""We believe that our approach to mandatory vaccines has been the right one as we have continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our Cast Members and Guests.""
""At this point, more than 90% of active Florida-based Cast Members have already verified that they are fully vaccinated,"" the spokesperson added.

1046,"(Reuters) - The Ohio Supreme Court has decided that an attorney who filed articles of incorporation using the names of businesses owned by the man his estranged wife was dating would receive a six-month stayed suspension for misconduct and false statements.
The court on Thursday largely adopted the sanctions recommended by its professional conduct board for Eric Jones, an attorney in Columbus, Ohio. The board took into account Jones' efforts to recover from mental health and substance abuse problems.
Jones in August 2018 filed articles of incorporation for “Haberdasher Club, LTD” and “Alpha Suit, LLC,” the names of businesses owned by Sean McKee, the man who was dating his wife, according to Thursday's decision.
McKee submitted a grievance against Jones over the filings with the Columbus Bar Association in 2019. Jones at first responded by falsely saying he filed the articles of incorporation to protect McKee's business interests from ""trademark bullying,"" the decision said, while later admitting that he was actually seeking to retaliate against McKee for dating his wife.
The court affirmed that Jones had violated state attorney ethics rules by making false statements about the incident and for filing to incorporate ""for no legitimate business purpose.""
Jones was also found to have engaged in conduct that negatively reflected his fitness to practice law after texting his wife implying retaliation against McKee for the grievance.
According to the filing, Jones was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and alcohol abuse in November 2019. After his release from the hospital, he entered a three-year Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (OLAP) program to aid in his recovery.
As conditions of Jones’ stayed suspension, he will be required to complete his OLAP contract with possible renewal, complete an ethics-focused monitored probation, refrain from further misconduct and pay the court fees for the disciplinary case, the decision said.
Two of the judges on Thursday dissented from the ethics probation condition. Justice Sharon Kennedy wrote that Jones' offenses were about ""human frailty"" rather than a ""pattern of professional misbehavior.""
“[This] really didn't have anything to do with his representation of clients or his practice of law,” said Jones’ lawyer, Charles Kettlewell, who said the sanction accurately reflects existing case law and said that no clients were affected.
Rick Dove, director of the court's professional conduct board, declined to comment beyond existing filings.
The case is Columbus Bar Assn. v. Jones, The Board of Professional Conduct of the Supreme Court of Ohio, No. 2021-Ohio-4070.

1047,"NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The New York Times urged a judge to restore what it called its constitutionally-protected freedom to cover the conservative activist group Project Veritas, on the eve of a hearing on a rare attempt to block news coverage by major media.
Project Veritas' claims ""do not implicate the kind of extraordinary public harms, such as national security, that American courts have suggested might rarely justify a prior restraint,"" the Times' lawyers said in a Monday court filing.
The newspaper also accused Project Veritas of trying to ""silence critical reporting,"" despite First Amendment guarantees, while it pursues a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper.
Project Veritas and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Justice Charles Wood of the Westchester County Supreme Court  at a Tuesday hearing will consider whether to extend or lift his Nov. 18 order blocking the Times from publishing or seeking various documents related to Project Veritas.
The group had objected to a Nov. 11 Times article discussing its journalism practices and a Department of Justice probe into its possible role in the theft of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley.
That article discussed memos by a Project Veritas lawyer that the group said were protected by attorney-client privilege. It wants the Times to destroy the memos and remove them from the Nov. 11 article.
The dispute relates to Project Veritas' separate defamation case concerning a September 2020 Times article describing a video the group released alleging voter fraud connected to the campaign of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat.
The Times said it has not faced any prior restraint since the Pentagon Papers case in 1971, and that ""well-settled"" law lets media publish newsworthy information they obtain independently, even when the subject is suing it for libel.
""If the rule were otherwise, litigants could readily silence critical reporting by filing meritless lawsuits,"" the Times said.
The Times also said it was ""difficult to understand"" how Project Veritas, which ""presents itself as an investigative news organization ... now advances arguments that would enable litigants to restrain its own work.""

1049,"ROME, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A boat carrying the bodies of 10 migrants found dead at sea arrived in Sicily on Friday, along with dozens of people it rescued this week as they tried to cross the Mediterranean.
The crew of the Geo Barents vessel, run by charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), found the corpses on an overcrowded boat 30 nautical miles off the Libyan coast.
They are believed to have died from suffocation after spending 13 hours on the boat's lower deck where there was an intense smell of fuel, MSF said in a statement.
Some 186 people rescued in three separate operations in international waters will disembark in Messina, a port on the southern Italian island, MSF said.
The migrants - mostly from Africa - include 61 minors, the youngest aged just 10 months.
""We hope they will get all the assistance they need,"" MSF said on Twitter, adding those who died will now have ""a decent burial"".
Italy has seen a sharp increase in boat migrants in recent weeks and the latest mass arrivals will put further pressure on Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government to secure an agreement with European Union partners over how to deal with the influx.
Some 59,702 migrants have disembarked in Italy this year, according to interior ministry data, up from 32,476 in the same period in 2020.
MSF said over 1,200 people had died during the perilous sea journey to reach Europe so far in 2021.",0
1050,"LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - COVID-19 lockdowns have returned anew to haunt Europe's economic prospects, forcing investors on Friday to reassess portfolios and sell vulnerable assets such as the euro and bank stocks.
Days after the Netherlands, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic reimposed curbs, Austria put itself back under lockdown and Germany's health minister refused to rule out one.  read more 
Markets were little soothed by Germany's foreign minister ruling out a lockdown and mandatory vaccinations for all to tabloid Bild.
The developments upended the buoyant mood in European equity markets where French and German shares had hit a string of record highs, thanks to a strong earnings recovery.
A pan-European equity index, up 80% from March 2020 (.STOXX), slipped half a percent on Friday (.STOXX).
""One thing is certain, if the whole of Europe had to go under lockdown once more, and depending on how long that would last, we would need to rethink our growth scenarios,"" said Stephane Ekolo, a global equity strategist at the brokerage Tradition.
As markets started scaling back wagers on euro zone interest rate rises for next year, an index of European banks (.SX7P) plunged 2.5%, its biggest daily drop since late September.
The question now is to what extent lockdowns might hammer expectations for fourth-quarter earnings. Refinitiv I/B/E/S currently flags a 51% rise for the STOXX 600 benchmark, only marginally below 60% in Q3.
It still compares favourably with predictions of a 21% earnings growth for S&P 500 companies.
But some ominous signs had emerged for Europe even before the latest COVID resurgence. European data lags U.S. equivalents by the biggest margin in over a year, according to economic surprise indexes compiled by Citi. (.CESI.)
Hospitality turnover was also weakening, Oxford Economics pointed out, noting Germany's 3.5% drop in September.
""Markets have been aware for a few weeks now that this winter will be difficult and that the vaccination rollout doesn't reduce lockdown risk by 100%,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays.
The setback, if it deepens, will prove painful to many. BofA's widely followed monthly investor survey showed funds most bullish on euro zone equities, with a 33% ""overweight"" and EU banks especially in favour.  read more 
Cau says it is too early to see the lockdowns as a gamechanger and that investors are booking profits off recent sizzling rallies. And deeply negative inflation-adjusted bond yields probably means that the tsunami of cash chasing global stocks will not ebb entirely.
And there will be winners: healthcare stocks (.SXDP) rose 1% on Friday, while the technology sector (.SX8P) gained 0.6%.
BUND BOOST
Investors made a beeline for bonds, turning Germany's entire yield curve negative for the first time since August as 30-year government borrowing costs fell below 0%.
Ten-year yields, the euro area benchmark, dropped as much as 6 basis points to the lowest since mid-September at -0.342%.
The euro tumbled to more than six-year lows versus the Swiss franc and approached 16-month troughs against the greenback .
""It's just building, that story of the pandemic not being quite over in Europe and that's a knee-jerk flight to quality,"" said Peter McCallum, rates strategist at Mizuho.
""The more that becomes a theme and we get the market thinking about a dovish ECB....we've got some room to fill the (10-year Bund yield) gap down to -0.45%,"" he added.
Some market watchers are starting to look beyond Europe.
Deutsche Bank noted that on the cusp of winter, vaccination rates in Austria and Germany at 64% and 69% were well above the U.S. 58% level.
""Although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the United States be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter?"" the bank wrote.",0
1051,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed while, prosecutors say, the 25-year-old Black man was on a Sunday run in a mostly white neighborhood about 2 miles (3.2 km) from his mother's house near coastal Brunswick, Georgia, on Feb. 23, 2020.
Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35, who shot Arbery with a shotgun; and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. They told police they thought Arbery was running from a crime as he ""hauled ass"" past the McMichaels' home in the Satilla Shores subdivision.
They wanted to make a citizen's arrest, they told police.  Arbery's family and their supporters say he was targeted because he was Black.
Here are some highlights of the trial before Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley of Georgia's Eastern Judicial District:
Nov. 3:
A jury of 11 white people and one Black man is selected in Glynn County Superior Court. It took almost three weeks because many potential jurors told the court they personally knew Arbery or know some or all of the defendants.  read more 
During jury selection, Kevin Gough, who represents Bryan, complained that the potential jury pool didn't contain enough white men over 40 without a college degree - people he called ""Joe Six-pack"" and ""Bubba.""
Prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to argue that defense lawyers rejected many potential jurors because they were Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has long deemed unconstitutional.
Nov. 5:
The jury is seated, and opening statements were made. Cobb County prosecutor Linda Dunikoski told the jury that the defendants had deadly intent. She pointed to something the elder McMichael told police he shouted at Arbery: ""Stop or I'll blow your fucking head off!"" read more 
Defense attorney Rob Rubin, representing the younger McMichael, told the jury that the men were trying to make a citizen's arrest.
""It is a citizen's job to help the police, and the law authorizes that,"" Rubin said. ""When seconds count, the police are often minutes away.""
Nov. 10:
Glynn County Police Detective Roderic Nohilly told the jury that Greg McMichael said Arbery realized he was not going to get away.
""He was trapped like a rat,"" the elder McMichael told the detective a few hours after the deadly pursuit, according to an interview transcript read aloud in court.
Nov. 11
The jury heard recorded police calls and saw surveillance videos of Arbery walking around a vacant, half-built house, over the weeks and months before his death. The final visit was just minutes before he was shot.
The McMichaels told police they were aware of reports of an unidentified Black man wandering around the property.
Outside of the jury's presence, defense attorney Kevin Gough complained to the court that civil rights leader Al Sharpton, a nationally known Black preacher, was in the courtroom with the Arbery family.
Gough said his team did not want ""any more Black pastors coming"" into the Georgia courtroom, saying it might influence the jury.

1052,"Nov 22 (Reuters) - Ahmaud Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man running through a mostly white neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020, when he was chased by three white men in two trucks, and shot and killed about 2 miles (3.2 km) from his mother's house near Brunswick, Georgia.
Here is the timeline of the case:
FEB. 23, 2020
Before 1 p.m. on Sunday Arbery left his mother's house, for a jog just outside coastal Brunswick, Georgia, his aunt, Thea Brooks said.
He crossed a four-lane highway into the Satilla Shores subdivision, lined with saw palmettos, old oaks draped with Spanish moss, and ranch-style homes with boat docks along the Little Satilla River.
About 2 miles (3.2 km) into his run, he passes Greg McMichael, who is in his driveway working on boat cushions. McMichael later tells police he thought Arbery might have been running from a crime. He yells to his son Travis McMichael to get a gun and they both give chase in a pickup truck, police reports say. They are then joined by a neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, in his own pickup truck, who videos part of the encounter on his cellphone.
After being boxed in by the trucks, Arbery is seen on video reaching for a shotgun leveled at him by Travis McMichael. Arbery is fatally shot three times, turns to run one last time, and falls prone on the street.
Glynn County police officers interview the McMichaels and Bryan, but do not file charges, following directions from Jackie Johnson, Brunswick Judicial Circuit's district attorney, a grand jury later found.
Greg McMichael, a former Glynn County policeman, also worked as an investigator for Johnson.
Feb. 24, 2020
Johnson recuses herself from the case because of her connection with McMichael and informally hands it over to the Waycross Judicial Circuit.
FEB. 27, 2020
Waycross Judicial Circuit's District Attorney George Barnhill formally takes the case, at the behest of Johnson, court records show.
April 7, 2020
Barnhill recuses himself from the case, telling his boss, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, that he didn't realize his son had previously worked with Greg McMichael in Johnson's office.
Carr transfers the case to the Atlantic Circuit's District Attorney Tom Durden.
May 5, 2020
A Brunswick radio station, WGIG, is given a copy of Bryan's video of the shooting by an attorney and posts it online. It becomes widely distributed on the internet, sparking a national uproar. Within hours, Durden announces a grand jury investigation. The same day, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp orders the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) to take the case.
May 7, 2020
GBI investigators arrest the McMichaels, charging them each with murder and other crimes. This is 74 days since the shooting.
May 11, 2020
Durden steps aside and Georgia Attorney General Carr appoints Cobb County's District Attorney Joyette Holmes to lead the prosecution. Cobb is the fourth district attorney to take the case.
May 21, 2020
GBI agents arrest Bryan and charge him with murder.
On June 24, 2020
A grand jury formally indicts all three men on charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment.

1054,"Nov 19 (Reuters) - Rising geopolitical tensions across central and eastern Europe and climbing gas prices should keep markets on edge in the week to come.
U.S. shoppers gear up for Black Friday while investors will scour inflation data and Fed minutes for hints on the impact of price pressures on interest rates. And, just how far will Kiwi rates fly?
1/BLOWING HOT AND COLD
Russia-West ties have been at their frostiest since the Cold War for a while - but could they turn hot? Russia's Vladimir Putin says the West is not heeding ""red lines"", warning against deploying NATO infrastructure in Ukraine. Russian troop movements at Ukraine's borders have led NATO to warn it was standing by Kyiv.
Ukrainian bond prices have slumped, Moscow's markets are waking up to fresh risk, Poland and Hungary have seen currencies and stocks fall hard. But much of the conflict is playing out on natural gas markets, where a 350% price surge this year will fan inflation and hurt growth.
Markets are also on alert for tensions flaring around Russia's $11 billion Nordstream 2 pipeline, opposed by the U.S. and Ukraine, supported by Germany. A suspension of its certification saw Russian gas flows to Europe ease, pushing prices back towards 100 euros a megawatt hour .
2/ UNEVEN BREAKEVENS
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's November meeting on Wednesday should provide clues on its take on inflation.
U.S. consumer prices rising at the fastest pace in more than three decades in October and accelerating inflation expectations have lifted expectations that the Fed will need to speed up tapering of asset purchases and hike rates faster-than-expected.
The 5-year and 10-year breakeven rate - the yield spread between inflation protected and normal Treasuries - stand at record highs. More fodder comes from Wednesday's reading of the October personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge - expected to rise to 0.4%, according to a Reuters poll.
3/RETAIL RODEO
Black Friday kicks off the key holiday shopping period and news has been mostly good for retailers in recent months as a vaccine-fueled U.S. reopening sent shoppers back into stores.
That's been reflected in retailers' shares: The S&P 500 retailing exchange-traded fund (XRT.P) is up 15% this quarter, compared with a 9% gain for the S&P 500. Consumer discretionary earnings growth - including many retailers - has risen to 14.5% from 8% at the start of October, Refinitiv data shows.
But global supply-chain bottlenecks crimping inventories and pushing up prices remain a worry: Walmart (WMT.N) shares tumbled after high labour and supply chain costs ate into margins.
Soaring inflation also has markets worried about consumers tightening their belts. But recent retail sales numbers made for happier reading, showing October sales surging as Americans started shopping early to beat supply shortages.
4/ GROWTH VS COVID
The flash November purchasing managers' index (PMI), a key forward looking economic indicator, is due out from a host of major economies in coming days -- the United States, Australia, Britain and the euro area.
Market focus is on what impact price pressures and supply bottlenecks are having on business activity and whether these are abating. Euro area PMIs, which have held up well, could provide a sense of what toll a resurgent COVID-19 is taking.
Germany's Angela Merkel warns the coronavirus situation in the powerhouse economy is dramatic, the Netherlands is in partial lockdown and pressure is mounting on Austria to do more. But vaccine rollouts and the reassuring - and hefty - presence of ECB stimulus ease some of those worries.
5/A NOT SO FLIGHTLESS KIWI
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to move deeper into the vanguard of inflation fighters on Wednesday, and deliver a second rate hike in as many months.
Since October, when the RBNZ joined Norway as developed markets' first hikers, inflation has surged to a decade high and the unemployment rate has sunk to record lows.
Traders are sure rates will go up, and are focused on two hawkish risks: A roughly 40% chance that the hike is a chunky 50 bps one, and the bank lifts its long-term rates outlook. ,
Either could hoist the kiwi  higher, though both bring risks to local borrowers already squeezed by the fastest pace of mortgage rate rises in 15 years.",0
1055,"Nov 18 (Reuters) - A key defense argument for the three white men on trial in Georgia for killing Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger, is that they were trying to make a citizen's arrest under a Civil War-era law that was later repealed amid an uproar over the shooting.
The defense can still use the repealed law in their defense because, as one lawyer said, it was ""the law of the land"" at the time of the February 2020 shooting. It was legal in Georgia for people to arrest someone where they had ""reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion"" that the person had just committed a felony. read more 
Lawmakers now limit citizen detainment to specific circumstances, such as shopkeepers who see a theft or restaurant workers seeing a ""dine-and-dash.""

1056,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - The chairman of Rogers Communications Inc (RCIb.TO) tightened his grip on the Canadian company with the appointment of his confidante Tony Staffieri as the interim chief executive on Tuesday, replacing Joe Natale, with whom he had a falling out.
The development comes after the telecommunications company earlier this month reinstated ousted Chairman Edward Rogers after a court backed his petition to constitute a new board.
The company said Natale has left the company, effective Tuesday, and the search for a permanent chief executive officer is on.
Natale's exit delivered another twist to the turbulent few weeks at Canada's biggest wireless carrier, after a messy feud in the founding family spilled into the public and sparked a bitter battle for the control of the board.
A rare public fight to rock the Canadian corporate world was triggered over the question of who should lead the company and had weighed on the stock.
Some analysts flagged doubts whether the uncertainty would impact Rogers' proposed C$20 billion ($16.1 billion) bid for rival Shaw Communications (SJRb.TO) - its biggest takeover.
The dispute started in September after Edward Rogers, the only son of late founder Ted Rogers, tried to drop Natale from the position of the CEO, saying he had lost confidence in Natale's ability to lead the company through the Shaw merger.
Edward Rogers wanted to replace Natale with Staffieri, the company's then chief financial officer, but he failed to win board support and that resulted in Staffieri leaving the company. But Edward Rogers' attempt to replace the CEO put him at odds with his mother and two sisters, who are company directors.
Edward Rogers lost out in the power struggle and was removed as the chairman of Rogers. But he petitioned the British Columbia Supreme Court to validate the new slate of directors he had appointed, and the court ruled in his favour.
""Tony is amongst the most highly regarded and seasoned telecommunications executives in the industry and was a key part of the Shaw deal,"" Edward Rogers said in a statement.
Staffieri has more than 30 years of experience in the telecoms, media, sports and financial sectors, including nine years as the chief financial officer of Rogers. Prior to joining Rogers, Staffieri held senior positions at BCE Inc (BCE.TO).
Rogers Communications director Robert Gemmell said in a statement that following the court ruling, the board had worked to establish a ""constructive working relationship"" to see Natale remain CEO through the closing of the Shaw merger. But a mutually agreeable arrangement could not be reached, resulting in Natale's departure, the statement added.
The boardroom battle has weighed on the company's shares, which gained just 2% so far this year, compared with a 17.6% jump in BCE and 14.5% rise in Telus Corp (T.TO), both rivals of Rogers.
The unique ownership structure in Rogers gives the chairman enormous power. Under the structure, 10 people close to the late founder, including his four children and widow, and several longtime family friends, sit on an advisory committee of the Rogers Control Trust. The trust owns 97.5% of Class A voting shares in Rogers.
The company said the merger process with Shaw continues to move forward, and the teams of Rogers and Shaw will meet Canada's telecoms regulator and attend a public hearing on Nov. 22.
The news was earlier reported by The Globe and Mail.

1058,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc must stop using the ""Mtn Dew Rise Energy"" name for its morning energy drink because of a trademark dispute with canned-coffee maker Rise Brewing, a Manhattan federal court has ruled.
U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield said in a Wednesday order granting Rise Brewing's bid for a preliminary injunction that it was likely to succeed on claims that PepsiCo's drink, launched in March, will cause customer confusion, and presented credible evidence that Mtn Dew Rise poses an ""existential threat"" to its business.
Schofield's order bars PepsiCo from using the Mtn Dew Rise name commercially and from selling products under any other name that would be confusingly similar to Rise Brewing's ""Rise"" trademarks while the lawsuit is proceeding.
Rise Brewing's attorney Jason Rosenberg of Alston & Bird said he and the company were ""incredibly pleased"" with the decision.
PepsiCo declined to comment. Timothy Durst of O'Melveny & Myers represents Pepsi.
PepsiCo also owns the Rockstar and Mountain Dew Amp energy drink brands and has been a distributor of Bang Energy drinks.
Stamford, Conn.-based Rise Brewing sued PepsiCo in June for trademark infringement. It argued Mtn Dew Rise was ""designed to specifically target the morning coffee drinker"" and ""marketed as a morning caffeinated drink to replace ready-to-drink coffee drinks such as Rise."" Pepsi also distributes Starbucks coffee drinks, and Rise Brewing said it knew the launch of Mtn Dew Rise would ""destroy a leading competitor.""
PepsiCo responded to Rise Brewing's request for a preliminary injunction in August, arguing that expert surveys indicated confusion wasn't likely, which Pepsi said wasn't surprising because Mtn Dew Rise is a ""fruit-flavored energy drink"" and not a coffee drink. Pepsi also argued that Rise Brewing didn't show it was harmed, and that an injunction would cause Pepsi to incur significant rebranding costs, lost sales, and ""unquantifiable losses"" to its reputation and goodwill.
Schofield said Wednesday that Rise Brewing had provided enough evidence of likely confusion and irreparable harm to justify the injunction.
The court said the companies' trademarks both ""highlight the single word 'Rise'"" and are displayed on their cans in similar ways, and that their products are similar ""canned, caffeinated drinks.""
Schofield also credited testimony from witnesses who said they had seen confusion in stores, and questioned Pepsi's survey evidence.
""In the context of this case, survey results may be particularly unreliable,"" Schofield said, considering that the marks have only been used in commerce simultaneously for a short time.
Schofield also said Rise Brewing had proven that it would suffer substantial harm without an injunction, citing testimony that its corporate identity was at risk if Pepsi ""continues to saturate the market,"" and noting an investor stopped investing in it because of likely confusion with Pepsi's product.
The case is Rise Brewing v. PepsiCo Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:21-cv-06324.

1063,"WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - While the U.S. Federal Reserve's next top regulatory official is still in the balance, one thing is certain: whoever gets the job will have a jam-packed agenda tackling the gamut, from capital rules and fair lending to digital assets and climate change.
The Fed's supervision chief Randal Quarles stepped down from that role in October and will leave the central bank at the end of the year. While the White House said on Monday it was renominating Jerome Powell as Fed chair, it punted on who would  take up the powerful supervision role overseeing Wall Street's biggest lenders. That announcement will come next month, it said.  read more 
Analysts and Washington insiders had long said the top contender for the role was fellow Fed governor Lael Brainard, but she will be stepping up to the Fed's vice chair role.
Other names floated include: Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor; Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic; acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu; U.S. Treasury under-secretary Nellie Liang; and Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor who had previously been floated for the Comptroller role.
Each would have their own take on the role and, in turn, would have to win the backing of the Fed chair and board, both of which are also in the balance, to push through major changes. read more
But any Democratic pick for the supervision post, whether centrist or progressive, will be expected to chart a new course and tackle a number of looming and in some cases thorny issues, say analysts. These include:
DE-REGULATION REDUX?
Over the past four years, Quarles led a review of regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, arguing they were too blunt and onerous. Democrats accused Quarles of saving Wall Street billions of dollars while increasing systemic risks.
Among the most contentious changes were revisions to the “Volcker Rule” curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual “stress tests” based on subjective concerns.
The new supervision chief will have to decide whether they want to revisit these changes, a potentially time-consuming and fraught exercise.
CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS
Climate change, a top policy priority for Democrats, is expected to rapidly rise on the Fed agenda under new leadership.
So far, the Fed has asked lenders to explain how they are mitigating climate change-related risks to their balance sheets, with the industry expecting to progress to a formal climate change scenario analysis in 2023, Reuters has reported.  read more [nL1N2RF1IC]
Those projects are expected to accelerate. The big question will be whether Quarles' successor pushes for restrictions or stiffer capital requirements on banks with significant exposures to polluting industries or other climate-specific risks.
The Fed may also sign off on climate risk lending guidance for big lenders which Acting Comptroller Hsu has said banking regulators are working on.  read more 
FINTECH FRAMEWORK
Quarles' successor will also have to tackle a regulatory blueprint for ""fintech"" companies that are quickly chipping away at the traditional financial sector.
The Fed is exploring how banks intersect with fintechs, particularly with smaller lenders that may outsource more services and infrastructure. Fintechs are also lobbying the Fed for access to its payments system.
While other banking regulators have worked for years to bring fintechs under their regulatory umbrella, the Fed has resisted, fearing doing so could create systemic risks. But as the sector continues to balloon, the Fed is expected to act.
“You hear a lot about the promise of fintech, but they should also be looking very closely at the risks,"" said Tim Clark, a former Fed official who now works with the advocacy group Better Markets.
On a related front, the Fed is currently studying the implications of a central bank digital currency. With studies from the Fed Board and Federal Reserve Bank of Boston expected soon, the central bank is trying to weigh the risks and advantages of such a product, which could expand its reach and help speed money transfers.
STRESS TESTS
Banks' annual ""stress test"" health checks are likely to be top of the list of Quarles' changes that Democrats will want to be reviewed.
Quarles tried to make the tests more transparent and predictable for banks, including scrapping a ""qualitative"" objection that allowed the Fed to flunk lenders on subjective grounds. Democrats say under Quarles the tests became too easy.
Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in September that stress test changes would likely come in 2023, and could include directing banks to reserve eight quarters of expected dividends, instead of the current four, and potentially reviving the qualitative objection.
SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO
Another issue on the table is the supplementary leverage ratio, a rule created after the decade-ago crisis requiring banks to hold capital against assets regardless of their risk.
The Fed had to temporarily ease that rule in the midst of the pandemic as a glut of bank deposits and Treasury bonds drove up capital requirements on what are viewed as safe assets.
Despite intense bank lobbying, the Fed let that relief expire in March but promised to review the overall rule. The Fed has yet to publish a proposal, leaving the job up to Quarles' successor.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The central bank will also play a key role in a long-awaited overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act rules which promote lending in lower-income communities. The Fed, which shares responsibility for writing the rules with other bank regulators, hopes the rules can be updated to reflect the growth in online banking, while still ensuring lenders make meaningful contributions to the poorer areas they serve.
