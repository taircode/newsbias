0,"On the day of his confirmation, Enzo Almeni walked through the grand West Doors of Liverpool's world-famous Anglican Cathedral, beneath the monumental statue of the Risen Christ.
He crossed the marbled floor, past the stone tombs of long-forgotten clergymen and commemorative plaques to the great and good of the City, to take his place in a pew before the high altar.
It was March 27, 2017, and Almeni was welcomed into the Church with open arms, in a ceremony attended by beaming friends and well-wishers — among them the retired, devout Christian couple who would invite him to live with them just days later.
This week the cathedral was part of a key line of inquiry for counter-terrorism police investigating a bomb explosion in a taxi parked outside a hospital a mile away, at 10.59am on Remembrance Sunday.
And, as we now know, the bomber was Enzo Almeni, a Christian convert who had changed his name by deed poll from Emad Al Swealmeen, and who had allegedly spent the months preparing explosives which, police confirmed yesterday, could have caused 'significant injury or death'.
The second terror attack in a month — following the killing of MP Sir David Amess — has seen the UK threat level raised to 'severe'.
It has also revealed to the wider public a flaw in the asylum process that some argue may have undermined national security for years: how churches and faith groups have, often innocently, aided some asylum seekers who falsely claim to be Christian converts in order to remain in the UK.
In the wake of the attempted Liverpool atrocity — in which Almeni died — a row has erupted over the so-called 'Pray to Stay' racket.
MPs from the Home Office Select Committee are demanding a Parliamentary inquiry, and a counter-extremism think-tank is calling for an investigation into the 'Liverpool Cathedral convert cluster'.
Home Secretary Priti Patel described the asylum system as 'a complete merry-go-round and it's been exploited by a whole professional legal services industry which has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day-in day-out on legal aid at the expense of the taxpayers'.
The exact circumstances of 32-year-old Enzo Almeni's conversion are not yet known (and there is no evidence he used it to aid his asylum application). 
But the Mail can today reveal the scale of Christian conversions that may have facilitated successful asylum claims sanctioned by the clergy — and how the Church of England's ruling body offered advice on the role of Christian conversions if asylum claims fail.
It is tempting to think of Almeni as an outlier who simply slipped through the intelligence net. 
But Khairi Saadallah, who murdered three men in a park in Reading last year, was also an asylum seeker who converted to Christianity upon arrival in the UK from Libya.
In 2018, a 38-year-old Iranian asylum seeker who raped a teenage girl was spared deportation even though a judge believed his conversion to Christianity was a deliberate ploy to beat the system.
The judge ruled that the man's 850 Twitter posts quoting the Bible placed him at risk of persecution if he was sent back to Iran following his release after serving five years in prison.
In recent years, UK immigration courts have heard the cases of hundreds of asylum seekers who claim to have converted to Christianity in order to stay here.
Under the Human Rights Act, if the asylum seeker can prove they are unable to live in their country of origin without fear of persecution, they can be granted leave to remain in the UK for five years. 
Those who convert from Islam to Christianity are committing the crime of 'apostasy' — 'deserting Islam' — in their home countries, which in some nations, including Iran, is punishable by death.
Supporting evidence provided to immigration tribunals by church leaders, who can vouch for the credibility of the asylum seeker's faith, can be the deciding factor in whether they are permitted to stay or are deported.
According to a report in The Times this week, some people smugglers are now even promoting conversion as a tactic to desperate migrants.
Some Christian churches work closely with immigration solicitors, who, it has been claimed, cross-refer asylum seekers to one another.
Last year, two Glasgow-based Iranian Muslims known only as TF and MA, who had converted to Christianity, won a landmark fight against the Home Office with the support of the Tron Church, a church of Presbyterian desendance in the city which is led by retired solicitor and missionary John Taylor.
This is despite the fact that, in an early hearing, TF was found to have fabricated a letter from an Iranian hospital, and entered the UK on a student visa in 2013 having 'been on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia . . . Undermining his claim that Islam did not play a role in his life'.
The second man first claimed he was a homosexual (a crime in Iran), then claimed to be Christian, which the judge said was being kept 'in reserve' as a 'Plan B' to be deployed if the homosexuality claim failed. 
The judge called the man's claim a 'multi-layered contrivance', adding: 'He is not a genuine asylum seeker and should be removed from the UK on that basis.'
Yet four representatives from the Tron Church, including Mr Taylor who has assisted the claims of dozens of Middle Eastern asylum seekers since 2010, backed their bids, and the joint case was ultimately successful when the Home Office backed down in October before an appeal re-hearing.
The case of TF and MA has already been cited in subsequent conversion tribunals and could pave the way for hundreds more claims. The Tron Church declined to comment on the case yesterday.
Some asylum seekers are open about the reasons for conversion. A man known only as Abdul, from the Middle East, recounted his experience to academic William Wheeler in a book published this year. [Conversion] was '60 per cent for my case', he admitted after his previous appeals for asylum failed.
'He succinctly described what being a refused asylum seeker means: your case is closed,' wrote Mr Wheeler. 'In order to put in a fresh claim, you need 'a new story'. Ultimately his claim was unsuccessful.
Of course, many asylum seekers are truly desperate people who have reached the UK after fleeing despotic, war-torn and dangerous regimes, and as charity is a core tenet of Christianity, it is only natural that church leaders would help those in need.
But is it possible that occasionally they go beyond that moral imperative to assist in more dubious claims?
In 2017, the Church of England (C of E) opted to encourage asylum seekers as part of its Presence and Engagement Programme, designed to assist clergy in parishes where more than one in ten of the population follow a non-Christian faith.
That year, the General Synod, the Church's governing body, advised clergy that where someone has already had an asylum application turned down, a conversion to Christianity would boost the chances of a successful new claim — seemingly issuing instructions to facilitate conversions when an original appeal has failed.
'Note that if the person has converted to Christianity after a previous refusal, that may be the basis of a fresh claim,' noted the text entitled 'Supporting Asylum Seekers — Guidance for Church of England Clergy'.
It makes clear that 'convincing evidence will be required' which might include 'testimony from a church leader; other testimony confirming their faith or conversion; evidence of persecution of Christians/Christian converts in their home country and evidence of laws from their country that punish apostasy'.
To Calvin Robinson, a CofE Ordinand in Holy Orders training for the priesthood, the message is clear: 'This document clearly shows the Church advising that a fresh asylum claim can be made if someone converts to Christianity.
'It's a demonstration for the clergy — it's saying in black and white the way to do it. 
'Here's the way to get them through. 
'Here is the loophole: Baptise someone and they can make a fresh claim'. It is an abuse of the sacrament of baptism.
'We're at risk of terrorists infiltrating our country and the Church is actually complicit at this moment. 
'The Archbishop needs to be very clear on what is meant by this document. For me as a Christian I find it offensive.'
Mr Robinson said that he had spoken to CofE priests and vicars who had raised it as an issue and felt 'discriminated against' as a result.
'One vicar told me about immigrant ringleaders who would bring a group of Muslim asylum seekers to a church on a Sunday, request a baptism for them regardless of the time they've been in the community, and within three weeks they are back asking for letters for their lawyers [to support asylum claims],' he told the Mail.
'The lawyers and vicars are working together to rubber-stamp these asylum claims.'
The rise in baptisms coincides with the drive in churches around the country to increase congregation numbers.
Indeed, at the time of Almeni's baptism in 2015, Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral was having some success in boosting its congregation even as it embraced prospective converts.
The weekly average aggregate attendance had risen from 438 in 2013 to 702. 
At the end of that year, Church Commissioners agreed £1 million of funding to roll out the cathedral's 'multiplying congregations' scheme across the diocese.
Dr Rakib Ehsan, a specialist in radicalisation and terrorism at the think tank the Henry Jackson Society, describes some elements of the church as operating 'almost an anti-deportation network in the UK'. 
'In recent times Anglican devotion has taken a dip,' he says. 'Is there a desperation to boost the numbers and reverse that trend?'
It is a provocative stance, but Church groups have been aware for years of the extent of doubtful conversions. 
In 2016, the Rev Pete Wilcox, a former Dean of Liverpool, said: 'I can't think of a single example of somebody who already had British citizenship converting here with us from Islam to Christianity. 
'Once you are a baptised Christian it is really not conceivable that you would be deported to a Muslim country.'
And Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian — a former curate at Liverpool Cathedral who is himself an Iranian refugee who converted to Christianity, and was later ordained — said the same year that 'people are desperate for a better life and sometimes they will lie for it — that's understandable'.
'There are many people abusing the system,' he added. 'I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault?'
Rev Sally Smith, a CofE priest at St Mark's Church in Stoke-on-Trent, said she'd seen around 150 conversions to Christianity in her church, and that she believed 'a very, very small minority of people' had done so in order to boost their asylum claims.
'I'd say probably on about 10-15 occasions I will guide people through the course, but there is no way that I would provide a letter to the Home Office or assist a person to go to court if I didn't believe they were absolutely genuine Christians,' she told the BBC Today programme this week.
'I always say: ""I'm not . . . helping you to swap one set of religious dogma for another in the hope that it will help you to gain asylum, because that's just not what we're doing.""'
The total number of asylum seekers converting to Christianity in Britain is unknown, but anecdotally, their numbers are rising.
Almeni was one of around 200 asylum seekers to convert to Christianity at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral over a four-year period, while 200 Iranian asylum seekers were baptised over a five-year period in a parish church in Stockton-on-Tees near Middlesbrough.
Meanwhile, in one year alone [2016], a quarter of confirmations conducted by the Bishop of Bradford were of converts from Islam.
Bradford and Liverpool, along with Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent and Stockton, are home to 'dispersal centres', where refugees are placed before their asylum claims are processed.
In recent years, clusters of Christian churches in these dispersal centre towns have sprung up, specifically catering to the new demographic.
Liverpool Cathedral hosts a weekly Persian service, attracting up to 140 people, while St Mark's in Stoke-on-Trent delivers some services in Farsi to suit its new congregation of up to 90 per cent Kurdish and Iranian immigrants.
Certainly, there is no shortage of advice for asylum seekers wanting to improve their chances before an immigration tribunal. 
Indeed, a public document issued by the CofE in support of asylum seekers states: 'If an asylum claim is on religious grounds, [solicitors] will rely on input from clergy. 
'Occasionally a solicitor is not sympathetic to claims of Christian faith; in which case it might be better to find another one.'
Advice used by the Joint Public Issues Team, a partnership between the Methodist Church, the Baptist Union of Great Britain and the United Reformed Church, was drawn up by a solicitor specialising in asylum law, who is also a member of the Methodist Refugee Working Group.
The jointly issued guidance in 2018 advises on how their clergy members can aid asylum seekers in the congregation and on testifying at an immigration tribunal, provides template legal letters and suggests how to counter arguments by the Home Office.
'The Home Office may argue that a Christian may safely return to their country of origin if they do not announce their faith,' states the document. '
They may contend that members of the United Reformed Church, for example, do not evangelise. 
'While you should never attempt to invent evidence of evangelistic activity, you may want to affirm that to evangelise is essential to what it means to be Christian.'
A spokesman for the Joint Public Issues Team said: 'We have seen people of all faiths and none treated inhumanely by the current asylum system . . . [and] will continue to call for an asylum system which gives people the fair hearing they deserve.'
Which brings us back to the Liverpool bomber Enzo Almeni's case. An asylum seeker of Iraqi and Jordanian origin, his first claim failed in 2014. 
The following year, he undertook the five-week Alpha 'crash course' on Christianity and was baptised at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral.
In 2017, he met retired Liverpool lay pastor Malcolm Hitchcott, and his wife Marion, both 77. 
They housed him for eight months, took him to Bible classes and welcomed him to their faith, culminating in his confirmation that year.
Over the years he lodged numerous appeals for asylum. At the time of the bombing at Liverpool Women's Hospital there was an appeal still outstanding, seven years after his arrival. 
Separately, a Home Office source has said that Almeni's attempts at using his Christianity in the asylum process was typical of the way arrivals had attempted to 'game the system'.
The Church of England hit back, stating that: 'It is not the role of clergy to establish the legitimacy of asylum claims and to assess security implications. 
'We are not aware of any evidence to suggest a widespread correlation between conversion to Christianity, or any other faith, and abuse of the asylum system.'
It declined to comment on the record about issuing guidance on conversions to aid with second asylum claims, but emphasised there is no evidence this was done to boost congregation numbers.
Liverpool Cathedral says that 'welcoming [asylum seekers] into a worshipping community is one way we engage'. 
It adds that it has developed 'robust processes' for discerning someone's commitment to faith before their application, including a connection to the community for at least two years.
Quite how robust those processes are is now under the spotlight.",-2
1,"Kyle Rittenhouse smiled in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse Friday afternoon after being cleared of all charges, later commenting that 'self defense is not illegal'.
Rittenhouse, 18, collapsed in tears and hugged his attorney as the jury in his double murder trial acquitted him of all charges after four days of deliberation and weeks of testimony. The verdict came in at 12:15 p.m. Friday in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  
'The jury reached the correct verdict,' Rittenhouse told Fox News.
'Self defense is not illegal. I am glad they reached the correct verdict.' 
He added: 'It's been a tough journey but we made it through. We made it through the hard part.'
The vindicated teen will sit down for his first TV interview on Monday with Fox News, host Tucker Carlson said. 
Part of the interview will air that evening, while the remaining portion will be included in Tucker Carlson Originals, the news station said.
Carlson appeared to side with Rittenhouse during remarks he made in August 2020. 
'People in charge from the governor of Wisconsin on down refused to enforce the law,' he said. 
'They stood back and watched Kenosha burn. So are we really surprised this looting and arson accelerated to murder? How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?'
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz.  
Outside the court, defense lawyer Mark Richards said Rittenhouse was feeling a 'huge sense of relief' at the verdict.
'He is on his way home, he wants to get on with his life,' Richards said. 'He has to get on with his life the best he can.' 
Richards said he believed the Rittenhouse family would move out of the area because of the number of death threats they have received.
'Kyle is in counseling for PTSD. He doesn't sleep at night,' he said. 
'Eventually some anonymity will come back to him but I don't think he will continue to live in this area.'
'I think it's too dangerous,' Richards said. He explained that Rittenhouse has had security following him around the clock 'since this happened.' 
He said Rittenhouse and his team have received a 'scary' amount of death threats. 
Richards revealed that the defense team had two mock trials, one with Rittenhouse giving testimony and one without, and it was clear from the jury reaction that he had to go on the stand. 
He also said the jury deliberations were longer than any other case he had been involved in.
Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted in the shootings, his lawyer said the teen plans to become a nurse. 
Shortly before he traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin armed with an AR-15 and shot protesters on August 25, 2000, Rittenhouse gave an interview to right-wing news outlet The Daily Caller. 
Armed with a rifle slung across his body, the teen told the reporter he was a certified EMT and explained he was patrolling the streets of Kenosha to provide medical attention to anyone in need and was helping protect local businesses from looters and rioters. 
'People are getting injured. Our job is to protect this business and part of my job is to also help people,' Rittenhouse said of his militia.  
'If there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way,' added Rittenhouse, who was seen earlier guarding a local car shop with a group of armed militia members. 
'That's why I have my rifle because I can protect myself, obviously. I also have my medkit.'
He also claimed he had been 'de-escalating' a potentially violent situation earlier in the night, during which he and the rest of his vigilante crew ordered protesters to leave a church that they had targeted.  
Rittenhouse's lawyer took out his anger on prosecutor Thomas Binger. 
'Justice is done when the truth is reached. Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth. It's not about winning,' Richards said.
But he praised Judge Schroeder, saying he had presided over a 'fair trial.'
'He gives you a fair trial as a defendant — but you don't want him to sentence your client,' he said, commenting on his reputation for handing out stiff sentences.
'If we had lost we know what would happen, he would have gotten life in prison. We asked for a fair trial and we got one.'
He defended Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the from a tumbler the jurors who would become alternates, saying the defense team was 'devastated' that three of the jurors they considered most on their side were barred from the final deliberations.
Binger had made it clear earlier in the week that he would not comment on the outcome of the case.
But his boss, Kenosha County District Attorney Mike Graveley, issued a statement saying: 'We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations.
'Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.'
Graveley added a plea for calm. 'We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.' 
The Rittenhouse shootings took place during 2020 summertime riots two days after Blake was shot when officers responded to a 'family trouble' around 5:15 p.m. August 23, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Now, Kenosha is on edge again as protesters from both sides milled about on the courthouse steps after the verdict. 
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that had threatened to derail proceedings more than once. 
President Joe Biden said Friday that he stands by the jury's verdict – as Republicans renewed demands that he apologize for calling the Kenosha shooter a white supremacist in the wake of the shootings.
'I stand by with the jury as the jury system has concluded. The jury system works and you have to abide by it,' Biden told reporters Friday afternoon as he returned to the White House from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had a physical.
He said he 'just heard a moment ago' about the verdict, adding he 'didn't watch the trial, which featured dramatic clashes between the prosecution and defense lawyers and testimony by the accused teen in an event that got gavel-to-gavel cable news coverage. 
Republican lawmakers and other officials are demanding that Biden apologize to Rittenhouse for linking him to white supremacists while campaigning for president. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), in a statement immediately after the verdict.
Before he gained infamy, Rittenhouse was a hot-tempered student at Lakes Community High School, his former classmates said.
'When he got mad or offended he would always say he could 'f*** me up,' but everyone would just laugh because he was like a 5-foot-4 chubby freshman boy who we thought wasn't capable of harm,' a student told Vice during right after the shooting in August 2020.
Other classmates told the outlet that Rittenhouse was fond of police, guns, former President Donald Trump, and 'triggering the libs.' 
Rittenhouse was born January 3, 2000 to parents Wendy and Mike and grew up in a broken home after the couple split.
Wendy Rittenhouse, a single mom of three, struggled to make ends meet and the family was evicted numerous times, The New Yorker reported.
She filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and was hospitalized with a gastrointestinal bleed, prompting her son to find work as a fry cook and janitor to support the family financially, the outlet said.
When he was in ninth grade, the magazine reported, the aspiring first responder joined an 'explorers program' at the Grayslake Police Department in Illinois, which the local police chief said was meant to 'teach self-discipline, responsibility and other appropriate life lessons to troubled teens.'
He also enrolled in a cadet program at the Antioch Fire Department, where Chief Jon Cokefair told The New Yorker: 'Most of the kids that are doing this, they don't play football, they're not cheerleaders. This is their focus.'
By all accounts, Rittenhouse seemed to idolize the police.
Before Rittenhouse's Facebook account was deactivated, it reflected the young man's admiration for law enforcement, which he praised heavily on social media.
 
In a photograph posted by his mother, Kyle is seen wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear. 
Records show that in January 2017 his mom claimed a classmate of her son's had been calling him 'dumb' and 'stupid' and threatening him as she sought an order of protection from police.  
Rittenhouse was identified in court papers as a lifeguard at a YMCA in Lindenhurst, Illinois. 
In January 2020, Rittenhouse sat front row at a Trump rally in Des Moines, Iowa. 
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.

COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
DISMISSED- COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it",-2
2,"The Prime Minister has ordered a Whitehall review into the cross-Channel migrant crisis, it emerged last night.
Boris Johnson is said to be 'exasperated' by his Government's failure to reduce the number of migrants on small boats making the journey and wants ministers to 'redouble' efforts to 'fix' the crisis.
Former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been put in charge of the review, according to The Times.
It will seek to find solutions to the crisis and make sure all departments – not only the Home Office – are contributing.
The review follows a week of record migrant Channel crossings, with 1,000 reaching the British shores on Tuesday alone and around 24,000 making the journey this year. The figure is almost triple the number that arrived in 2020.
Mr Johnson's frustration comes after a series of promises made by Home Secretary Priti Patel to tackle the crisis.
They culminated this week with the suggestion that asylum seekers could be sent abroad for processing. Countries including Albania are being considered as possible destinations. 
Last night it emerged that Ms Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants which will see new restrictions imposed on asylum seekers, as well the construction of new purpose-built reception centres, according to The Daily Telegraph.
In Greece, migrants face regular checks on their movements which include curfews to stop them going off the radar.
Speaking of Mr Johnson's frustration that the migrant crisis has not yet been solved, a senior government source said the PM saw it as one of his biggest priorities and he was concerned that 'after two years there are still no viable solutions'.
Germany is becoming a hub for migrants attempting to reach Britain, it emerged last night.
Asylum seekers are massing in the country as a new staging post for Channel crossings masterminded by people-smuggling gangs.
Organised crime groups are also using German sites to store dinghies and other small boats used to attempt crossings, sources said.
Six out of ten migrants arrive in France only on the day they attempt their crossing, travelling there through Belgium and the Netherlands.
A UK government source described Germany as 'the established hub for criminal trafficking gangs' in Europe. 
It is also a key location in the criminals' supply chains, where boats, life jackets and other equipment is sourced for Channel crossings, they added.
'Boris is exasperated. He's told ministers to redouble efforts to fix this, no matter how difficult it is,' they said.
'If it looks bad now, it's going to look much worse in spring when it's warmer.'
In new plans being drawn up by the Home Office, migrants will have asylum claims thrown out if they abscond or misbehave.
The changes – which will require legislation – will be crucial in the operation of the new processing centres, which will house asylum seekers while their cases are scrutinised.
Migrants could also be issued with 'asylum apps' to track the progress of their applications on smartphones or computers in the centres.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has been impressed by the way Greece has digitised its asylum application process to track cases, sped up decisions and cut down on unnecessary paperwork.
Speaking to The Telegraph, Miss Patel said Greece had decided 'not to sit behind the EU block of competency'.
Ministers are also keen to avoid a repeat of riots at asylum centres.
'If they breach the rules, it will affect their asylum claim,' a source said.
'They would be told they have to be back in by a certain time, and so on. Terms would include preventing absconding.'
Some previously reported plans to tackle crossings have included the use of giant wave machines, nets to snare boat propellers and floating walls in the sea.
However, Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, told the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week that they were never considered'.
He added that the wave machine idea is 'bizarre'.
But the move to bring in Mr Barclay could be seen as an admission that the Home Secretary has not managed to tackle the issue.
It comes after Sir Keir Starmer accused Ms Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
The Labour leader said Ms Patel has not secured strong enough agreements with the French government to prevent migrants making the dangerous sea journey.
He said the Home Secretary repeatedly used 'strong language' to say how she would tackle the problem, but delivered 'absolutely nothing'.
October 15, 2019
Priti Patel vows to halve migrant crossings – then a tenth of the current level – by the end of the month and make them an 'infrequent phenomenon' by the spring of 2020.
'I am absolutely committed to doing everything in my power to stop these dangerous Channel crossings which are putting vulnerable lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Migrant numbers hit a record 1,185 in a day last week.
August 7, 2020
The Home Secretary backs sending Royal Navy patrols into the Channel.
'The number of illegal small boat crossings is appalling and unacceptably high.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Within hours, Ministry of Defence sources suggested the proposals were unworkable.
July 6, 2021
Miss Patel unveils powers for UK Border Force to turn back migrant boats and reduce asylum rights for people who arrive in Britain illegally.
'Access to the UK's asylum system should be based on need, not the ability to pay people smugglers.'
WHAT HAPPENED? The tactics have yet to be used amid opposition from France and even the UK Border Force over legal concerns.
July 20
She agrees to give France another £54million to tackle the crisis.
'The public are rightly angry that small boats are arriving on our shores, facilitated by appalling criminal gangs who profit from human misery and put lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? In October France accused the UK of withholding the money amid a row over whether Paris was doing enough to stop the boats. The first instalment of UK cash was later paid – but numbers coming over the Channel continue to rocket.
November 15
Miss Patel and French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, vow they will deliver on their pledge to prevent '100 per cent' of illegal crossings.
JOINT STATEMENT: 'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings... and make this deadly route unviable.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Days later the French embassy in London said 100 per cent 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
November 18
The Home Secretary launches an attack on the EU's open borders policy, blaming Brussels for the crisis.
'The real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – open borders. On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. They simply can't.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Free movement for people between member states in the so-called Schengen area is a fundamental EU principle and there is no prospect of it being changed. 
His attack came as Ms Patel blamed the EU's open borders – established by the Schengen Agreement – for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc.
Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was 'constantly pressing' the French on the issue, but that they were 'overwhelmed'.
'Let's not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – Schengen open borders,' she was quoted as saying.
It is thought at least 10 migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing.
It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British 'oscillate between partnership and provocation' when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: 'We need to further strengthen collaboration.'
Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensified recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where canisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants.
Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work 'extremely closely' with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe.
'We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings,' a No 10 spokesman said.
'This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions.'
Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britain's 'busted' asylum system.
Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a 'dysfunctional' system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in 2015.
Sir Keir said: 'My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted.
'This Government has been in power for 11 years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch.
'Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at.
'So if the asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.'
Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador to Britain flatly denied reports his country has been in discussions with the Government about hosting a processing centre for migrants who arrive in the UK.
Qirjako Qirko told LBC radio that there had been 'zero talks' between the two countries on the issue.
'It's absolutely fake news because as my prime minister stated yesterday – the foreign minister also tweeted yesterday – that doesn't exist, any negotiations between Albania and the UK regarding these processing centres,' he said.
'It will not be changed because my prime minister was crystal clear yesterday when he said that Albania… will never be a processing centre for illegal immigrants.'
Speaking on a trip this week, Ms Patel said offshore processing centres remained 'on the table' but refused to discuss specific negotiations. 
There have been suggestions that migrants could be sent and held abroad - such as in Albania - while their cases are looked at. 
'We keep everything on the table… and this is why the new Nationality and Borders Bill is just so important,' she said.
'I'm the only Home Secretary over a 20-year period that has taken on the challenge of reforming what is fundamentally a broken system of asylum and illegal migration.' She admitted for the first time that Britain was facing a 'mass migration crisis'.
And, after months of friction with the French government, Ms Patel appeared to change her tone when she said the flow of small boats needs to be treated as a 'Europe-wide problem'. 
She said France was 'overwhelmed' by asylum seekers heading for the UK.
And she blamed Brussels – which governs EU border policy – for failing to act. 'Let's not forget the real problem on illegal migration flows is [that] the EU has no border protections whatsoever,' she said.
'On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. Other countries have to do much more in terms of border protection.'
Seven out of ten migrants who attempt to cross the Channel have entered France through Belgium according to French officials, Miss Patel said.
She added: 'The EU's Schengen zone is free movement and open borders. They do not have border controls and border checks. 
'There is no united position across EU member states in terms of how to tackle this issue. It's an EU competency issue.'
Deploying highly-charged language, the Home Secretary went on: 'There is a mass migration crisis. I've said this from day one – from the minute I walked into the Home Office. For everyone who complains about this – and no-one is more angry and frustrated about this than myself, alongside the British taxpayers – there isn't a silver bullet.
'There's no point saying, 'Well, you could just push boats back'. It will not stop it. There are all sorts of issues with criminal gangs, smugglers, etc.' Ms Patel said of the French: 'I think it's fair to say they are overwhelmed. That is a fact.
'We are constantly pressing France on this and we're asking them to be honest with us about where the gaps are because they can't be everywhere. We have a very, very professional working relationship, but no one country can fix this on their own.'",-2
3,"Candace Bushnell walks into the Carlyle Hotel in New York, an uptown vision in a pink cashmere dress and Dolce & Gabbana coat.
On her feet are a pair of divine Manolo Blahnik slingbacks and, frankly, anything less would have been a disappointment.
She sits down, crosses her fabulous legs and orders a cappuccino.
‘I feel like celebrating,’ she says. ‘Last night I didn’t forget a single line.’
At the age of 62, Candace has taken the bold step of starring as a version of herself in a one-woman show which has just opened off-Broadway and comes to London next year.
Is There Still Sex In The City? is adapted from her memoir of the same name and traces her life from well-to-do Connecticut childhood to her cosmo-drinking, party girl heyday, then through her marriage, divorce, the menopause and beyond.
It is funny, poignant and inspiring, all of it delivered by Candace standing atop various pairs of five-inch heels on a stage set furnished with her own pink satin sofa from her Upper East Side apartment, her own carpet and even her own poodles, Pepper and Prancer, who bound on at the end.
If the message here is that her dogs have made her happier than any man ever did, it is one she delivers without rancour or regret.
‘Actually, being a writer has meant more to me than any man could, unfortunately that is true. Writing is the one thing I have that I can totally rely on,’ she says. ‘One of the reasons why a lot of relationships did not work out for me was a lack of respect from the man towards my work. Totally. And I just I can’t do that.
‘Out in the world, women get a lack of respect, but in the home I need a cheerleader. And a lot of guys are not that because there can only be one star in a relationship. And it’s going to be them.’
Bushnell broke out in the mid 1990s as a sex and relationship columnist for The New York Observer. Back then, she didn’t want her parents to be embarrassed by her frank scrutiny of modern sexual manners in her Sex And The City columns, so she invented a character called Carrie Bradshaw, a chic cipher for Bushnell herself.
Even now, an unexpected strain of good girl conservatism informs her opinions, an unusual trait in a celebrated former sexpert. She loathes porn (‘don’t get me started’) and even raises one of her perfect eyebrows at some of the more exuberant passages in E. L. James’ mummyporn bestseller, Fifty Shades Of Grey.
‘Look. I don’t want to say anything negative about the writer. If you can write a book and make millions of dollars, that’s fantastic. Great for you because you know, it’s hard. But I started reading one of the books. And in the first paragraph the guy puts a turnip or something up . . . And I was like, I can’t. I just can’t bear what I have been reading.’
In the velvety plush of the Carlyle’s breakfast parlour, coffee cups are stilled and an enthralled hush descends. ‘Porn has changed sex,’ she continues in her clear, steady voice. ‘I mean, nobody talks about women having orgasms any more.
‘In the early 1980s, the Big O was like a new discovery. And men worked really hard at giving women orgasms. It felt like there was a pride among men; ‘‘I’m going to please my partner.’’ Now you never hear that. Now it’s all, I’m going to please myself.’
Yes well, um, would you like a croissant or something?
‘Now it’s all, I’m going to demand that my partner does things that I see in porn, like anal sex or choking.’
Perhaps some toast?
‘Jan, it is all about the man’s pleasure, not the woman’s. You go on a date and it’s transactional; a lot of guys just want their wiener waxed. I don’t want to get into a whole thing about porn, but I am not a fan.
‘It makes the 1990’s look like an age of innocence, it really does. For a start, there was no social media or cell phones back then, so if you wanted to have sex with someone, you had to do it in person, right?’
Damn right.
In the hit HBO TV series, which ran for six seasons and was made into two Hollywood films, the Carrie/Candace character was played by Sarah Jessica Parker. A lover of beautiful shoes and unsuitable men, Carrie became a feminist and fashion icon for generations of young women who adored her, despite her flaws.
Now she is back to stalk the streets of Manhattan once more in And Just Like That . . ., the rebooted HBO series which starts next month.
The new show finds Carrie reunited with gal-pals Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), although Kim Cattrall will not be returning as sexpot Samantha.
Did she make the wisest decision of all, one wonders?
For nearly three decades later, the landscape of these characters’ lives must have changed completely, along with their physical appearances on and off screen.
Before the show has even been broadcast, the participating actresses have been criticised for daring to age — it’s just so pathetic, but there you go.
Sarah Jessica Parker, now 56, has called comments about her grey hair ‘misogynist chatter’, while Davis (also 56) has been the target of uncharitable comments about plastic surgery treatments. Nixon (55) is also being targeted by trolls.
‘There are people who feel that women over 50 really shouldn’t even be seen in public,’ sighs Candace, whose own hair is a buttery whip of glamorous blonde and whose toned body bears testament to regular Pilates workouts and a 16,000 steps a day dog walking habit.
Despite this, she can still be as vulnerable as the next woman when it comes to the indignities of the ageing process. She once spent £3,000 on face creams after a saleswoman told her she had ‘too much filler in the cheeks’. She has also suffered the double mortification of not one but two boyfriends offering to pay for her to have a boob job.
‘I’m so flat-chested that one boyfriend’s mother used to call me ‘‘The Ironing Board’’,’ she says. ‘Anyway, there are people out there who are envious, people who just want to put someone down to make themselves feel better. Young men in particular have very rigid ideas about what women should and should not be.’
Of course, the truth is that although they are forever twinned in the collective imagination, Candace’s life diverged from Carrie’s many years ago.
After Sex And The City was adapted for the TV series in 1998, Bushnell had nothing more to do with the shows nor the films nor the lucrative revenue streams that followed.
‘As the show has grown it gets farther and farther away from the source material. I mean, there are fans out there who don’t even know it was originally based on a book,’ she says. ‘Did I earn my fair share from it? I often wonder.
Women in the entertainment industry never do as well as the men. I was cut out of certain deals. And I really shouldn’t talk about it because one’s got to be grateful. Yeah. As a woman back then you were told to be grateful for whatever you got.’
She appears not to be embittered by any of this, not even by the universally panned second film, and not her characters’ tendency to indulge in what one critic called ‘featherbrained feminism’.
‘No, the film wasn’t great, but people did their best,’ she says. ‘And as for everything else, I let that all go a long time ago. I don’t even know what a “Carrie” is any more. I just keep moving forward, trying to explore my own creativity.’
She has written ten books, married and divorced ballet dancer Charles Askegard (he had an affair with a younger dancer, Candace named her in the divorce papers) and now lives in contented singledom, mostly in her house in Sag Harbour in the Hamptons.
A recent relationship with a millionaire property developer called Jim Coleman has evolved to ‘just good friends’.
‘These things happen. And anyway, he moved to Palm Beach,’ she says.
Much of this is chronicled in her warts and all stage show, charting the highs and lows of her remarkable life.
‘There I am, 48 years old, my hair falls out, my vagina dries up and I am exhausted,’ she says at one point, cocktail glass in hand, telling it like it is, or was.
On stage she also reveals for the first time that she became pregnant when she was dating ‘a count from Luxembourg’ sometime in the 1980s, but decided to have an abortion.
‘Yes, I did,’ she tells me. ‘And if I had the baby, Sex And The City would not exist. That’s something that people need to understand.
‘Lots of women make this choice because it’s just not the right time. It wasn’t the right time for me to have a child and he wasn’t the right person, he was very unstable.
‘I don’t regret it and I don’t think there is any shame attached to having a termination. To me, bringing a child into the world under the wrong circumstances is what is morally wrong.’
Her stage show is set out in a series of life lessons, which include Men Lie About Everything; When It Comes To Sex There Is No Free Lunch; and perhaps the most important one of all; Your Girlfriends Are Forever.
After the turbulence and hurly-burly of the dating game, Bushnell seems to have happily settled down into a Hamptons existence shared with her dogs and her single girlfriends; a period of her life she calls The Bonus Years.
‘There is so much fun and joy being with a bunch of single women again, all supporting each other, being there for each other. The reality for women is there is a big chance you are going to be single at some point in your life. Statistically, it’s going to happen. And it is something that women need to know how to do; you need to know how to be in a relationship and also know how not to be in a relationship.’
Bushnell is slender with a porcelain doll face, but she shimmers with the strength of a survivor, a woman who has persisted.
As a young girl at acting school, she had to learn how to deal with ‘creepy’ behaviour.
‘At auditions or photoshoots, men would tell me to take my clothes off. I always refused.’
As an older woman, she had to negotiate the privations of the menopause. ‘It’s a big psychological moment for all women, because we’re always told that our worth is based on an ability to have children, then suddenly that is gone, it’s a tool no longer in our toolbox.
‘Some women don’t really have anything else to fall back on. I had a moment of ‘‘Oh my God, this is happening to me’’. It lasted for an hour or so, then I got over it.’
Despite being ‘as horny as hell when I was 18’ she doesn’t miss the sex, not at the moment anyway.
‘Oh God, I don’t really want to talk about my sex life. I honestly don’t. Once you get over a certain age, people don’t want to hear specifics. Anyway, right now I feel like I don’t really have time to pursue a big sexual relationship.
‘I don’t want to be with some twentysomething guy just for sex. I’m too old to have sex just for sex, and that was never me anyway.
‘If I have sex it’s got to be a cool thing. There’s got to be conversation, he’s got to be interesting, there has to be a continued form of communication. That is what I want. I want to have the best sex.
‘But then there is the possibility of emotional disappointment. You know, if I had sex tomorrow with someone and they didn’t call me the next day, I’m probably still going to feel be a little upset. And that is not a good look when you’re 62 going on 63,’ she says, and roars with laughter.
Candace is a card, she really is. You might think that Sex And The City has changed her life and made her fabulously rich, but it hasn’t, not really.
She still lives in a tiny apartment in New York, not far from the tiny apartment she had when she was writing her columns all those years ago. Yes, she says, she bought the house in the Hamptons but one that was ‘on the market for two years because nobody wanted it’.
However, she is not pleading poverty, she still drinks cosmopolitans and she still loves shoes.
‘Last week I bought a new pair of Manolos. I think they were $900. But they are a costume, right? I need them for the show.’
How many new pairs has she bought? ‘Only four,’ she says unabashed.
Nearly 30 years ago, Candace Bushnell entranced millions of women with her buccaneering adventures, her independent spirit and her unshakeable belief that good shoes will bring you good luck. Today, she must sometimes wonder what all that boy-crazy fuss was about. Her life has been no fairy tale, her Prince Charming is still noticeable by his absence, but thrillingly, she still has faith in the power of shoes.
‘If you believe they will bring you luck, then they will,’ she says, wiggling her own Manolos. ‘All you have to remember is that this is not a Cinderella story. It is the opposite of Cinderella. It is not sitting at home waiting for life to happen, saying ‘‘Oh, I lost my shoe and somebody needs to find me’’.
‘It is about putting on your shoes and going out there and finding that life for yourself.’",-2
4,"It is the Duchess of Sussex’s favourite animal charity – praised by her for its ‘commitment to animal welfare and community wellbeing’.
But pet specialists at the Mayhew Trust are now fighting like cat and dog over claims of wasted money, falling standards of animal care, and even allegations of bullying, racism and homophobia.
Its very future, bosses have warned, could be ‘in jeopardy’.
Meghan, who is patron of the charity, often speaks out about the importance of diversity and mental wellbeing.
She is so keen on the Mayhew that she undertook a ‘secret’ trip to the sanctuary for cats and dogs last January before leaving the UK for Canada.
She also made an official visit while pregnant with son Archie in 2019. At its premises she has cuddled pets and chatted with staff and volunteers.
Yet union representatives from the Mayhew, which runs kennels in north-west London, are now balloting for strike action over its treatment of staff and concern for the animals.
The charity had a total income of £3.1million last year, almost half in donations and a similar sum from wills. However, staff numbers are said to have been reduced from 58 to 49.
Bitter employees point out that at the same time as it is cutting jobs, the charity has been advertising for an £80,000-a-year ‘head of engagement’.
One former member of staff told the Daily Mail: ‘That money would pay for four staff actually to care for animals. It’s such a kick in the teeth.’
The whistleblower also claims that one senior staff member referred to a junior worker who wore glasses as ‘Speccy Four Eyes’, called an Asian woman ‘Old Slitty Eyes’ and scoffed at a gay man’s talk of his husband, as well as a lesbian couple’s plan for a child.
The same person was said to have admitted provocatively ordering steak in front of vegan and vegetarian workers at work social events. The whistleblower added: ‘This person was racist, sexist, homophobic. I reported it but nothing was done.’
Volunteer Judy Stapleton, who has helped out there for seven years, claimed ‘bullying’ had driven out key workers. 
She added: ‘The atmosphere there is just so sad. Why are they getting rid of these dedicated staff? I think there is an element of the Mayhew getting caught up in celebrity instead of focusing on being a small, local community charity.’
The Mayhew, founded in 1886, finds new homes for dogs and cats, and runs an animal clinic in Kensal Green.
A charity spokesman said it had carried out a necessary restructure and added: ‘Any staff strike action would significantly affect the charity’s ability to care and treat the sick animals.’ The charity ‘refutes any allegations of poor animal welfare’.
In June, Meghan wrote an introduction to its glossy annual review, saying: ‘Mayhew continue to meet us where we are as a society and foster the healing connection between animal and human.’",-2
5,"Carrie Johnson could soon be walking down the aisle again, but this time as a bridesmaid.
I hear the best friend of the Prime Minister’s wife, Emma Barr, pictured with Carrie, is engaged, to restaurant PR man William Hanley.
Emma, a former government special adviser who worked as a Tory press officer under Carrie, tells me: ‘William and I are over the moon and we can’t wait to celebrate with our friends and family.’
She has publicly accused Carrie’s critics of ‘jealousy’, gushing: ‘She was a wonderful boss and has always gone out of her way to support me.’ 
(Very) modern manners
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s university pal, singer and actor Jules Knight, is taking ‘rewilding’ to extremes.
The dashing former Holby City star, 40, reveals he’s upped sticks from his home in London for the country in a bid to save the environment.
‘I’ve moved into my eco-hut to better manage my re-wilding project at my estate in North Norfolk, where I’m attempting to live off the land as I work on my next album,’ Knight tells me.
‘It’s entirely powered through a mixture of solar, wind, and animal waste, so I’m totally “off the grid” power-wise.’
Don’t pooh-pooh it!
Mrs Elba loses her sparkle next to Kitty
Slipping into a £2,380 figure-hugging dress for a wedding usually guarantees turning at least a few heads, but unfortunately for Idris Elba’s wife, Sabrina, it had the opposite effect.
The 33-year-old former Miss Vancouver chose to wear a stylish Rick Owens gown to attend the Los Angeles wedding of her friends, PR boss Simon Huck and Phil Riportella, a finance executive.
She soon discovered, however, that her mauve frock was the same colour as the walls of the Beverly Hills Hotel.
‘Sabrina is beautiful and usually stands out everywhere she goes, but for a chunk of the night she basically faded into the background,’ says one of the guests.
Sabrina is pictured above with her pal, Princess Diana’s niece Lady Kitty Spencer, 30, who had no problem attracting attention in a sparkling Dolce & Gabbana number.
She once modelled lingerie, but ex-M&S model Erin O’Connor considers mini-skirts a fashion faux pas.
The 6ft Vogue cover star says she refuses to wear them because they are ‘disproportionate’ for her height.
‘I would never wear miniskirts,’ exclaims the 43-year-old. ‘I know they’re meant to be sexy and quite feminine, but it actually does the opposite for me.’
She adds: ‘I really enjoy being a woman, but the shape and structure of women’s clothing hasn’t done me a huge amount of favours.’
Despite her dislike of mini-skirts, Erin says she’s been forced to wear them on the catwalk.
‘I’ve worn them for work, but when I have a say in terms of feeling desirable and a bit sexy, I would wear a really well-cut pair of trousers. That’s my idea of sexiness.’ 
The smart set’s talking about... Why Gilmour girl is in the pink
 Landing a tiny part in Downton Abbey eight years ago, aged 11, was just the beginning for actress Romany Gilmour.
I hear the daughter of Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour and novelist Polly Samson has been snapped up by one of the country’s biggest talent agencies.
‘I am very happy to announce that I am now represented by Tavistock Wood,’ confirms Romany, who joins Hollywood stars Alicia Vikander and Lily James on their books. Romany is the youngest of David’s eight children.
Her first credited appearance will be in Wonderwell, starring the late Carrie Fisher.
A woman of many talents, Romany is also a musician and last year sang with her father on Yes, I Have Ghosts",-2
6,"A former school governor is running an anti-vax group that has picketed over 100 schools, the Daily Mail reveals today.
Francesca Dill is behind Outreach Worldwide whose 50 UK 'chapters' target pupils with dangerous conspiracy theories.
The 32-year-old mother has posted social media footage of herself telling children the Covid jab is 'deadly' and could leave girls infertile. She also claims falsely that 'many' deaths of youngsters are being covered up.
Her group, which includes a veteran teacher, youth mentor and a social worker, also 'serves' head teachers with 'notices of liability' if they allow pupils to be jabbed at school.
Health experts and teachers said Miss Dill's 'poisonous' falsehoods were putting lives at risk and that the school pickets should be banned.
The Mail investigation also reveals that:
A hairdresser who previously worked as a mentor for vulnerable children is spreading anti-vaccine propaganda outside schools.
Keely Knight is one of the most trusted lieutenants of Outreach Worldwide leader Francesca Dill.
Miss Knight, 33, was filmed bombarding pupils in London and the South East with lurid claims about the jab's potential side-effects.
In one clip she told children people have 'gone blind' from the vaccine and claimed she knew someone 'whose leg was amputated'. 
When a boy asked what the likelihood was of serious side-effects, she replied 'very high'.
She previously had mentoring and safeguarding responsibilities at a charity offering counselling for young people with learning difficulties. 
She did not respond to a request for comment.
Our shocking expose comes amid growing concern about anti-vaxxers turning schools into the front line of their sickening fight to spread misinformation.
The Association of School and College Leaders revealed last month that 79 per cent of schools it surveyed had been targeted by anti-vaxxers, mainly been through emails threatening legal action.
But staff have been threatened with physical harm and protesters have invaded some school sites. 
One told the Mail that Outreach Worldwide picketers told 12-year-olds that the jab would poison them.
When David Collins, head teacher at Knole Academy in Sevenoaks, Kent, confronted them, Miss Dill asked him why he was facilitating the jab 'knowing that children are dying?'
She added: 'Parents aren't happy with your leadership, If a child dies, how are you going to feel about it? Because they will, and it's your fault.'
Miss Dill, who has a teenage son, lives in Brixton, south London, where she served as parent governor of a primary school in 2013. 
Using the name Cheska she manages the main Outreach Worldwide groups on the messaging app Telegram and multiple sub-groups that organise school pickets.
The Department of Education has said it is doing everything in its power to counter the spread of untruths and has provided guidance to all schools on how to manage vaccination-related protests in liaison with the police, NHS and town halls.
Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor in the school of medicine at the University of Leeds, said there was no evidence that a single child had died in the UK because of the vaccine, which had been subject to robust efficacy and safety trials before being administered.
'The idea that it could cause infertility is particularly insidious and absolute rubbish,' he said. 
'It is a poisonous rumour based on an assumption that an undergraduate biology student could tell you was wrong.
'How many billion doses of the vaccine have been given out? I think one or two of them may have got pregnant afterwards.'
He said it was a 'complete fallacy' to say the vaccine did more harm that the virus and pointed out that vaccines were the way out of the pandemic. 
'These people are causing immense harm by targeting kids and parents,' he added. 'It should be made illegal for them to campaign outside schools.
'Parents are already anxious, and all this does is breed uncertainly and more anxiety about the vaccine. 
'These groups are on the extreme end, but their views trickle down and you find many reasonable people refusing the vaccine after being scared by these people.'
Peter Kyle, Labour Party schools spokesman, branded the anti-vaxxers 'quacks' who 'spew bile and fake news into children's faces'.
He said: 'If these people were around 350 years ago they would be calling for Galileo to be burned at the stake for saying the Earth went around the Sun.
Outreach Worldwide attempted to sabotage the Government's Covid testing programme by urging supporters to mass-order free lateral flow kits. 
The group posted an 'urgent call to action' on its Instagram page explaining that packs of seven were free to pick up via pharmacies and explained how to order them online.
It added: 'When stocks run out there will be a dramatic reduction in mass testing. The more ordered, the faster they will run out. It will take under a minute to place your daily order.
'Set an alarm every 24 hours and you'll have 30 packs in a month. It won't take long for stocks to run out and mass testing to end.'
In a cynical conclusion, the post, on November 4, stated: 'Be sure to dispose of the tests once you get them! (so no one else can use them.)' In its 'training manual' for recruits, the group said its main goal was to 'encourage the general public to stop public testing urgently.'
The Government's multi-billion-pound testing scheme began in April with everyone urged to take two per week as the country gradually emerged from lockdown.
They are designed to be taken by people without coronavirus symptoms and help to detect the estimated one third of cases that are asymptomatic.
'They want scientific expertise and knowledge to be driven out of the way we govern our country.'
He added: 'They want to send us back to an era where superstition determined our fate. We can have no truck with them. 
'If these people had their way, millions of people would have died and that's only in the last year or so.'
Facebook, which owns Instagram, removed the Footsoldiers4Freedom Facebook page and several of the Outreach Worldwide Instagram posts after being contacted by the Mail.
The social media giant is continuing to investigate the Outreach Worldwide account. 
In videos posted online Miss Dill denied being against vaccinations, saying she did not count the coronavirus jab as a vaccine.
Approached for comment, she said: 'Outreach Worldwide is a human rights organisation with a Christian ethos. 
'We're dedicated to educating and empowering the local community and we are just concerned about informed consent. We are not anti-vaccine. We've never been anti vax.
'But we believe that informed consent is really important.'
Miss Dill added that she denied providing any false or misleading information, and was simply exercising her 'lawful and democratic right to publicly inform others of their right to make choices'.
But a video shot outside a school in Walthamstow, north-east London, shows her telling girls they could end up 'really sick' if they get the jab, adding: 'It is deadly for your health.'
She warns another group that there is a 'real possibility' that taking the vaccine will leave them unable to have children.
To other teenagers she says: 'Hey ladies, you won't be getting the Covid jab will you? It's important that you don't.
'They're going to be trying to give you the Covid-19 injection at school and you need to say no to it – it's really quite dangerous.'
She also encourages children to take off their masks, claiming they are bad for their health.
Anti-vax rapper's 'Pied Piper' tour of the UK urging, 'Don't tek di vaccine'
By DAILY MAIL REPORTER 
A rapper has become the 'Pied Piper of anti-vaxxers' as he tours the UK performing his rap urging schoolchildren not to get the jab.
Extraordinary footage posted online shows Jamaican born Edward Freeman, who uses the name Remeece, leading dozens of children in school uniform along a road singing his song, 'Don't tek di vaccine'.
Carrying a megaphone, he gets the pupils to join in the with lyrics calling vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna 'you tools, you fools'.
In another Facebook video, he performs to a group of around 50 children outside a school, in which he declares 'the vaccine is killing people'.
After his performance he is mobbed by the youngsters who pose for selfies, fist bump him and repeat his song. One schoolboy tells him: 'I won't get the vaccine 'cos of you.'
Mr Freeman's trips to spread false and dangerous myths about the vaccine have taken him from Cornwall to Glasgow, videos posted on his social media accounts show. 
The ex-male model, PR worker and nightclub operator, is the key figure in an anti-vax and anti-lockdown group called Footsoldiers4Freedom.
On his website, amidst a string of conspiracy theories, he also has a sideline selling anti-vax merchandise, including hoodie tops emblazoned with his slogan for £45. Mr Freeman did not respond to requests for comment.
Fanatics tells pupils: The vaccine will poison you
By TOM KELLY and JACOB DIRNHUBER for the Daily Mail
Protesters from the Outreach Worldwide group told 12-year-olds that the Covid vaccine would 'poison' them, a head teacher has warned.
Knole Academy in Sevenoaks, Kent, was targeted by demonstrators this week.
Headmaster, David Collins, 47, went to confront those waiting at the schoolgates. Footage shows the group's leader Francesca Dill then asking him why he was facilitating the jab 'knowing that children are dying?'
She added: 'Parents aren't happy with your leadership. If a child dies, how are you going to feel about it? Because they will, and it's your fault.' 
Mr Collins told the Daily Mail the protests were 'totally inappropriate' and called for police action to remove trespassing campaigners.
The demonstrators claimed they were on a public road, but the headmaster said the area was part of the school site.
'These people clearly do not have the best interest of students at heart', he said. 'They were telling 12-year-olds that the vaccines will poison them, and in my mind that's totally inappropriate.
'If you've got a problem with that, take it up with the Government, don't start approaching children. Three of them in particular were quite rude and unpleasant, and refused to leave when I said they were trespassing.
'It shouldn't be left to us, I don't think it should be the role of any teacher to end up having to confront protesters and keep them away from the school.
'Ultimately, it's a police matter as soon as they come on the school site. We'll do it because we have a duty to protect the children in our care, but it's not really what we've signed up for.
'The funny thing was they had a yellow sign saying, 'Beep if you hate the vaccine' or something – but the only car to beep it was one of theirs. They drove past over ten times – it was a bit tragic.'",-2
7,"Germany is becoming a hub for migrants attempting to reach Britain, it emerged last night.
Asylum seekers are massing in the country as a new staging post for Channel crossings masterminded by people-smuggling gangs.
Organised crime groups are also using German sites to store dinghies and other small boats used to attempt crossings, sources said.
Six out of ten migrants arrive in France only on the day they attempt their crossing, travelling there through Belgium and the Netherlands.
A UK government source described Germany as 'the established hub for criminal trafficking gangs' in Europe. 
It is also a key location in the criminals' supply chains, where boats, life jackets and other equipment is sourced for Channel crossings, they added.
This week Home Secretary Priti Patel attacked the EU's open borders policies for allowing migrants free access across the Continent, and called on Brussels to act. 
UK officials are increasingly dissatisfied with the French government's response to the crisis. 
During the last major Channel surge – which saw the 'Jungle' camp spring up at Calais in 2015 – France sent 3,500 of its tough Compagnies Republicaines de Securite officers to the area.
By comparison, the UK's latest £54million handout to Emmanuel Macron's government has seen just a couple of hundred reservist gendarmes deployed. 
British officials believe the shortfall has left the French struggling to deal with the massive numbers pushed through by gangs.
However, the French president yesterday took aim at the UK over the crisis.
He said: 'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation. We need to further strengthen collaboration.'
The number of migrants to have crossed this month has now surpassed 4,000.
It means 23,761 people have now arrived on UK shores this year with more expected yesterday as many braved the poor conditions. ",-2
8,"An organic farm that supplies award-winning cheeses to upmarket retailers and farmers markets has sacked a worker over cruelty revelations.
The Bath Soft Cheese Co, which makes a number of 'supreme champion' cheeses, claims to put the welfare of its cows at the heart of its operation.
Its website even carries the mantra 'Look after your cows and your cows will look after you'.
However, campaigners from Animal Justice Project, say the evidence of seven months of secret filming on the company's dairy farm reveals alarming cruelty.
A member of staff was seen slapping, punching, and kicking cows in the face; as well as hitting them with plastic pipes around their hindquarters, legs and udders.
Footage of the separation of cows from their calves showed them bellowing in distress for many hours.
There is video evidence of at least one cow showing severe lameness, while calves only a few days old were held in narrow pens with very little room and no contact with others.
Images showed the calves being manhandled during so-called debudding, which involves removing their horns.
And bull calves were sent for slaughter soon after birth, rather than being reared on for beef, which is considered the most ethical approach.
Bath Soft Cheese, based around a dairy farm in Kelston, supplies organic retailers such as Able & Cole, Planet Organic and farmers markets. 
Its award-winning cheeses include Wyfe of Bath, Merry Wyfe, and Bath Blue, some of which have won awards.
However, the owners of the business say they are 'horrified' by video evidence of the behaviour of one herdsman, who has been sacked, however they reject the other allegations.
The Animal Justice Project showed the footage to veterinary and welfare experts, including Professor emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, Marc Bekoff. 
He said: 'It is never acceptable to hit and kick farmed animals, particularly when they have nowhere to go, as viewed in this footage.
'Cows can discriminate between people who handle them roughly and who are gentle with them.'
Veterinarian, Dr Molly Vasanthakumar, said the footage of lame cows was 'most likely exacerbated by the long waiting times in the slurry-filled concrete collecting yards and passages prior to milking'.
She added: 'On this particular farm, calves are kept in individual small pens, with no contact to other animals other than through the bars. It is impossible to see how young, inquisitive animals are expected to display natural behaviours in those conditions.'
Animal Justice Project founder, Claire Palmer, said: 'Footage captured on this multi award-winning organic dairy is in stark contrast to the image portrayed by the farm.
'Callous kicking, slapping, punching, yelling and swearing at cows; the desperation and anguish of calves who cried for days after being separated from their mothers; and the pitiful individual housing afforded to youngsters for up to a month post-separation preventing play and other normal, social behaviours.'
Hugh Padfield, whose family has been running the 240-acre Park Farm since 1914, said: 'We are horrified by the scenes of a herdsman hitting cows. It is totally unacceptable. The member of staff involved was recently hired, we have taken disciplinary action and he will be leaving the farm.
'Our ethos is to be open, friendly, accessible and honest in everything we do, which is why the farm has public viewing areas.
'Our aim is to maintain the highest standards of welfare on our farm and we expect our staff to adhere to these standards at all times.'
Mr Padfield, said the video footage gave a misleading view of its activities.
'The newly separated calves are kept in individual pens to make sure that they are drinking their full allocation of milk each day. When we are confident that they are strong then they are moved into larger pens with other calves of a similar age,' he said.
'We keep lame cows separately in the central loose-bedded area, which one of the cameras filmed. This area is overlooked by a viewing area. The cows have to be walked out of this area to be examined by the vet who visits regularly.
'Dehorning is carried out to stop cows injuring each other. Whenever we do this it is carried out under local anaesthetic and under veterinary guidance.'
He said the reason bull calves have been sent for slaughter, rather than reared for beef, is because of an outbreak of bovine TB. This explanation was rejected by the welfare group.
Mr Padfield added: 'We are concerned that this footage, which is highly edited to mislead, selectively chosen and portrayed with no context, does not represent what happens on our farm on a daily basis, where animal welfare is at the heart of all we do.'",-2
9,"Former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has pulled out of the race to be next chairman of media regulator Ofcom and launched a blistering attack on the civil servants he accuses of blocking his appointment.
In a letter to The Times, Mr Dacre said he had been rejected by an interview panel because of his ‘strong convictions’ and has taken the decision not to re-apply for the job despite the appointment process being re-opened by Boris Johnson.
Mr Dacre said he would instead take up an 'exciting new job in the private sector' and attacked senior Whitehall figures' determination to exclude anyone with right-of-centre 'convictions'.
He called his encounters with senior civil servants an ‘infelicitous dalliance with the Blob’.
He wrote: 'To anyone from the private sector, who, God forbid, has convictions, and is thinking of applying for a public appointment, I say the following: The civil service will control (and leak) everything.
'The process could take a year in which your life will be put on hold; and if you are possessed of an independent mind and are unassociated with the liberal/left, you will have more chance of winning the lottery than getting the job.'
Mr Dacre also made reference to Sarah Healey, the permanent secretary at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport who notoriously said working from home allowed her to spend more time on her expensive Peloton exercise bike. 
To the Editor of The Times
Following a welter of ill-informed, increasingly hysterical speculation from the left-wing media, I’d like to set the record straight that I have not reapplied for the OFCOM Chairmanship, nor do I intend to apply despite being urged to do so by many senior members of the government.
I wish OFCOM all the luck in the world as it faces the awesome challenge of trying to regulate the omnipotent, ruthless and, as we’ve learnt, amoral tech giants without damaging freedom of expression – a freedom I spent 28 years as an editor fighting for both publicly, and privately with ministers.
Whether OFCOM, whose Chief Executive is a brilliant career civil servant, latterly at the Ministry of Housing, has the wherewithal to deal with such issues, is a different kettle of fish.
As is the daunting task facing OFCOM of helping ensure that the BBC (which I am on record as describing as a great, civilising force which I would die in a ditch to defend) is saved from both itself and the frighteningly well-resourced streaming giants.
At the original Chairmanship interview – in which the contribution of one of the assessors was unhelpfully undermined by a belated admission of a small conflict of interest – I suggested that OFCOM’s role as independent regulator of the BBC was compromised by the fact that two of its senior Board members were ex-BBC executives (one of whom subsequently resigned over his involvement in the Bashir scandal).
After the interview – at which another candidate, a senior public official with an impressive reputation, was also judged to be unappointable – my feedback was that, though I’d given a good performance, showing a solid grasp of technological issues, I’d revealed strong convictions that were incompatible with the role of an independent chairmanship.
To anyone from the private sector, who, God forbid, has convictions, and is thinking of applying for a public appointment, I say the following: the civil service will control (and leak) everything; the process could take a year in which your life will be put on hold; and if you are possessed of an independent mind and are unassociated with the liberal/left, you will have more chance of winning the lottery than getting the job.
Me? After my infelicitous dalliance with the Blob, I’m taking up an exciting new job in the private sector that, in a climate that is increasingly hostile to business, struggles to create the wealth to pay for all those senior civil servants working from home so they can spend more time exercising on their Peloton bikes and polishing their political correctness, safe in the knowledge that it is they, not elected politicians, who really run this country. 

He wrote: 'I'm taking up an exciting new job in the private sector that, in a climate that is increasingly hostile to business, struggles to create the wealth to pay for all those senior civil servants working from home so they can spend more time exercising on their Peloton bikes and polishing their political correctness, safe in the knowledge that it is they, not elected politicians, who really run this country.'
Mr Dacre also praised the BBC as a 'great, civilising force' that he would 'die in a ditch for'. 
He added the Corporation would need to be 'saved from both itself and the frighteningly well-resourced streaming giants' in the future.
'I wish Ofcom all the luck in the world as it faces the awesome challenge of trying to regulate the omnipotent, ruthless and, as we've learnt, amoral tech giants without damaging freedom of expression - a freedom I spent 28 years as an editor fighting for both publicly and privately with ministers.'    
‘Whether Ofcom, whose chief executive [Dame Melanie Dawes] is a brilliant career civil servant, latterly at the Ministry of Housing, has the wherewithal to deal with such issues, is a different kettle of fish.’
Mr Dacre detailed the original interview he undertook in which he revealed he and another senior figure were deemed 'unappointable'.
He wrote: 'At the original Chairmanship interview – in which the contribution of one of the assessors was unhelpfully undermined by a belated admission of a small conflict of interest – I suggested that OFCOM’s role as independent regulator of the BBC was compromised by the fact that two of its senior Board members were ex-BBC executives (one of whom subsequently resigned over his involvement in the Bashir scandal).

Mr Dacre was the editor of the Daily Mail for 26 years. The journalist was educated at University College School in Hampstead, north London, before studying at Leeds University.
He had a taste for news from a young age, having edited his school magazine and university student paper.
After leaving Leeds he worked for the Daily Express as a reporter but joined the Daily Mail a decade later in 1980.
He spent a year editing the London Evening Standard before taking up the mantle at the Mail in 1992.
He became well known for his campaigning headlines such as 'Murderers' in 1997, where he accused five men of killing Stephen Lawrence.
Mr Dacre also received widespread praise for his role in stopping Gary McKinnon being extradited to the US for hacking into Pentagon computers.
He was personally thanked by the 46-year-old Asperger's sufferer's mother for 'standing up for Gary non-stop for years'. 
This year, Mr Dacre will lift the lid on his time at the Mail in a three-part Channel 4 programme called The World According to Paul Dacre.",-2
10,"SAS troops helped raid homes allegedly linked to the Poppy Day bomber, as the elite unit joined the hunt for any prospective accomplices of the terrorist.
Pictures show a heavily armed operator from the SAS's counter-terror squad in tactical gear and armed with a powerful automatic rifle as the regiment stormed properties in Liverpool after the suicide bomb attack.
It is believed special forces operatives utilised new drone technology, equipped with in-built electronic security, to neutralise any remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED).  
Military insiders suggested the elite team were called upon to lead the raids in Liverpool because their 'specialised training' made them perfect for the high-pressure situation of hunting down potential active terror threats.
It comes as police revealed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen, 32, started building a 'bomb factory' at a rented bedsit as early as April.
Armed units raided a property in the Sefton Park area of Liverpool shortly after Al Swealmeen blew himself up at Liverpool Women’s Hospital on Remembrance Sunday.
The next day, bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion in the park, and Rutland Avenue, where the explosives factory was located. It remains closed off.
Yesterday afternoon officers also extended a cordon around Sutcliffe Street in Kensington, central Liverpool, where Al Swealmeen is thought to have lived.   
The SAS were summoned to head-up the anti-terror raids in the historic waterfront city amid fears there were other jihadist-sympathisers operating with Al-Swealmeen, the Mirror reports. 
It is understood that the anti-terror squad's searches focused on drains, toilet systems and other external outlets to find traces of IEDs or other bomb-making equipment.
Part of the elite unit's training, honed in Afghanistan, sees them work to eliminate potential threats before they have a chance to detonate their explosive devices. 
Techniques utilised for combat in the Middle Eastern theatre include using ladders to scale walls rather than using potentially boobytrapped main entrances or doors.   
'The decision to send in the SAS was made very quickly because of their high level of training. The police counter-terror teams are extremely good but special forces are so highly trained that when the doors go in they don’t flinch,' one military source told the Mirror. 
'They are able to make split-second decisions with no hesitation and this saves lives in what may have turned into a high-intensity, very risky situation.'
Yesterday it emerged that Al Swealmeen had spent months trawling the internet to buy chemicals and metal components in small quantities to avoid detection.
The failed asylum seeker, who arrived in Britain from Iraq, is said to have had online shopping packages constantly arriving at his rented flat in Liverpool.
Officers have recovered traces of chemicals from the bomb factory indicating that he experimented with various explosives.
One of the recipes he is understood to have followed was for hexamethylene triperoxide diamine – the same material used by the July 7 2005 London bombers.
Counter-terrorism police confirmed they believe the 32-year-old's Remembrance Day weapon would have caused 'significant injury or death' if it had gone off outside.
But the fact it detonated inside innocent David Perry's taxi outside Liverpool Women's Hospital, meant only the bomber was killed.
Police also disclosed on Friday that devious Al Swealmeen purchased components from his bomb individually and by using a number of fake names to avoid flagging systems.
After the explosion, officers from the bomb squad were on the scene and a counter-terror police spokesman said several suspicious packages had been found after police raids.
Residents were ordered to stay indoors and others forbidden from returning to their homes. They were instead directed to a nearby primary school for shelter.
Forensic tests are still being carried out on the taxi which exploded with Al Swealmeen inside. It was confirmed last night that he died of injuries sustained in the blast and from the subsequent fire.  ",-2
11,"Experts have questioned the authenticity of newly released photos that appear to show missing tennis star Peng Shuai smiling as she poses for the camera behind a sea of children's toys.
Three photographs posted online by a reporter working with CGTN, the international wing of China's state broadcaster, purportedly show the 35-year-old tennis ace posing with a grey cat while surrounded by a bed of soft toys.
Shen Shiwei, the man who shared the pictures to Twitter on Friday, said the images had been posted on Shuai's WeChat messenger, but experts have continued to express doubts over the veracity of the pictures.
Fears continue to mount for Shuai, once ranked as the top female double's player in the world, who has not been seen since accusing the country's former vice premier of rape on November 2.  
Friday marked the second time in as many days that the Chinese-state broadcaster attempted to alleviate concern over the missing tennis star, after sharing an email claiming to have been written Shuai in which she said she was 'resting at home'.
Andy Murray and Serena Williams have become the latest high-profile names to join the campaign to find missing tennis star Peng Shuai in the wake of her sexual assault allegations.
As news broke of the pictures being shared online, internet sleuths also raised questions over the fact that a framed picture of Winnie the Pooh - a character banned in China - appeared in the background.
The former doubles world No 1 has not been seen or heard from publicly since she said on Chinese social media in early November that former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex three years ago, and that they had had an on-off relationship.
The post was quickly deleted from her verified account on Weibo, a leading Chinese social media platform, but screenshots of the explosive accusation quickly spread despite the topic being blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet. 
23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams, 40, publicly called on the authorities to launch an investigation into Shuai's disappearance and urged those involved to 'not stay silent'. 
Andy Murray then weighed in on the uncomfortable situation himself, noting: 'Female tennis player Peng Shuai whereabouts currently unknown after making Sexual abuse allegations against Chinese government official. 
'This speech gives us a reminder and some hope that things can change in the future #WhereIsPengShuai'  
Meanwhile, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) said it was prepared to pull its tournaments out of China if they were not satisfied with the response to her sexual assault allegation.
It comes after Chinese state media published an English-language email they claimed was written by Peng which said: 'I'm not missing, nor am I unsafe. I've just been resting at home and everything is fine.' 
Steve Simon, the head of the Women's Tennis Association, said he has a 'hard time believing' that Peng wrote the email herself and it 'only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts.'
Simon said that nobody from the WTA has been in direct contact with Peng since she accused 75-year-old Communist party official Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex on Chinese social media two weeks ago. 
On Wednesday, Simon cast doubt on an email, which was also released by a Chinese state media outlet on Twitter, purporting to be from Peng and denying the allegations of sexual assault.
'I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her,' he said.
By Friday, the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai had racked up over 32 million mentions on Facebook's Instagram, which is also blocked in China, as well as Twitter, according to hashtag analysis website BrandMentions.
Earlier, China's Foreign Ministry has said it was not aware of the controversy surrounding Peng, who disappeared after accusing a former top official of sexually abusing her.
Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that the matter was 'not a diplomatic question and I'm not aware of the situation'.
The ministry has consistently disavowed knowledge of the issue since it broke as a major global story earlier this week.
Despite this, international pressure has been growing to uncover the truth about Peng's whereabouts, with 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams, 40, urging an investigation to be launched.
Peng, 35, is a former top ranked player in women's doubles who won titles at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014.
She also participated in three Olympics, making her disappearance all the more prominent with Beijing set to host the Winter Games starting on February 4. 
Liz Throssell, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights office in Geneva, said Friday it was calling for 'an investigation with full transparency into her allegation of sexual assault.' 
'And I think we would say that that should be the case into all allegations of sexual assault. It is really important to ensure accountability, to ensure justice for the victims,' she said. ",-2
12,"Twelve people will stand trial in Paris over a £7.4million jewellery heist targeting Kim Kardashian West in 2016, authorities revealed on Friday.
The reality TV star said she was tied up at gunpoint and locked in a bathroom after armed robbers forced their way into her rented Paris apartment during fashion week.
After five years of investigation, judges have ordered the case sent to trial, a judicial official said Friday.
The 12 suspects face a range of charges related to the theft.
No trial date has been set, and the official would not provide further details. Kardashian West's French lawyer did not immediately comment.
Several suspects have been released from jail pending trial for health reasons, including 68-year-old Yunice Abbas, one of the five men accused of carrying out the heist itself, who published a book about it last year.
The alleged mastermind, Aomar Ait Khedache, wrote Kardashian West an apology letter from his prison cell, saying he regrets his actions and realizes the psychological damage he caused.
At the time, a spokeswoman for Kardashian West said she was badly shaken but physically unharmed. 
Kim and sister Kourtney traveled to Paris together in October of 2016 to attend Paris Fashion Week.
In a reunion episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians in June this year, Kardashian West told host Andy Cohen she still cannot sleep if there are any 'expensive items' in her home. 
Five years after the robbery, she revealed: 'As far as jewelry, if I'm wearing something, it's borrowed. It's fake.
 'I can't sleep if I have jewelry in my safe, or money, or anything at my house. I just don't live my life like that.
'The things I valued before that happened were genuinely completely different than what I value now. It's fun to get dressed up and all this, but like, [material] things don't make me.' ",-2
13,"A cinema in Wales has been ordered to close after its owner refused to ask customers to show their NHS Covid pass.  
Cinema & Co in Swansea announced on Tuesday it would not enforce the rules which came in this week, extending the Covid pass scheme in Wales to cover cinemas, theatres and concert halls.
Visitors are legally required to show an NHS Covid pass to enter the venues.  
The Welsh Government claimed that the scheme played a key role in keeping people safe from the virus.
But owner Anna Redfern said on Facebook the rules were 'unfair and killing the entertainment industry' and vowed to 'take a stand' against the new 'discriminatory and unlawful' measures.  
Last night, notices had been pinned to the shutters of the cinema after it had closed for the day.
The notices said the venue had been closed due to the requirement to 'minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus on premises'. 
However, today, the cinema was open and operating again in defiance of the rules, prompting the council to say that it was 'considering further steps'.
They said the venue could be closed for a maximum of 28 days.  
At least a dozen people were reportedly seen in the small cafe inside the 56-seat venue this morning. 
Speaking yesterday after her cinema was ordered to close, Ms Redfern said: 'I'm clearly distraught.
'I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the offers of help and support locally, nationally and even internationally. 'I have no further comment to make, but I will not be bullied.'
A spokesman for Swansea Council said: 'The Council has recently issued the owners of Cinema & Co with a legal notice requiring them to close for a maximum of 28 days. 
'This was issued due to the absence of any measures to protect the public against Covid 19. 
'We have since been made aware the business has reopened and we are now considering further steps to ensure the venue complies with the current Covid regulations. 
'Thankfully, the majority of businesses in Swansea have acted in a responsible manner in the interests of public safety and have worked with the Council to ensure venues have appropriate measures in place to help minimise the spread of coronavirus.'  
In its post on social media earlier this week, Cinema & Co said: 'Dear Customers. As an independent business, we will not be implementing the nonsensical & unnecessary Covid passports here in Swansea, Wales, as they are unlawful, an infringement of our human rights & discriminate against those exercising their right to bodily autonomy.' 
Speaking before the closure order, mother-of-two Ms Redfern said she has lived in fear for the past year and wanted to stand up against restrictions.
She said she wanted 'people from all walks of life' to know they are welcome at her Cinema & Co venue in Swansea, South Wales
She said: 'There are businesses that are skirting around the rules, people aren't using them appropriately and the sheer knowledge that you have to have one of these is putting people off.
'People don't want to come for this reason and this is why I wanted to say something and take a stand.
'Businesses are living in fear of losing their livelihoods and I'm in the exact same position, I didn't want to pretend to comply anymore out of fear.
Ms Redfern claimed that the rules on the entertainment industry in Wales are 'discriminatory.'
She said: 'If this is the hill I am going to die on then this is the hill I'm going to die on.
'I'm standing up for what I believe in, it is not fair by any stretch of the imagination - it is killing the entertainment industry and hospitality is even next - it says so in the rules.
'They keep changing the goal posts, they keep putting up more obstacles and I have a right to earn a living, it puts food on my kids table and I'm a single mum, dealing with all this has been extremely challenging.
'There's a huge discrimination element to these passes and people aren't able to access their rights, we're in 2021 and we're discriminating against those who have chosen to exercise bodily autonomy'
The Welsh Government says the passes can play a key role in keeping people safe.
Fixed penalty notices can be given to businesses which breach regulations - with the maximum £10,000 fine for repeated breaches.
Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties campaign, said it was starting legal proceedings against the Welsh government, calling the scheme 'authoritarian, invasive and unevidenced'.      
Welsh Government regulations say that businesses have to complete a risk assessment before opening and that should include whether a Covid pass is needed and how it would be enforced. 
On Friday, Public Health Wales reported eight further deaths from coronavirus, along with 2,456 new cases. 
It brings the total number of deaths to 6,342, and the total number of cases to 484,744.
In the UK as a whole, daily Covid cases rose by another 10 per cent today and deaths ticked upwards, but hospitalisations fell by 17 per cent.   
Government dashboard data shows 44,242 positive tests were registered in the last 24 hours, a slight uptick from 40,375 last Friday. 
Another 157 Covid deaths were also announced by health chiefs, in an eight per cent rise from the same time the previous week. 
Latest hospitalisation figures showed 827 admissions were recorded on November 15, which was down 17 per cent. 
Since October 11, all over-18s in Wales have had to use the NHS Covid Pass to show that they are fully vaccinated or have tested negative to attend large events, nightclubs and other similar venues.
This applies to:
To get into these venues, people must prove one of the following:
You can use the NHS Covid Pass, or test results emailed or sent by text message are also considered proof of a negative test.",-2
14,"An Insulate Britain eco-warrior who went on hunger strike in protest at being jailed for taking part in protests that brought Britian's motorways to a standstill has urged more eco-zealots to step up and continue the group's extreme campaign.
Emma Smart, 44, - who will be housed in Europe's largest women's prison which is home to murderers and child rapists - was handed a four-month sentence for taking part in a protest on the M25 on October 8.
In a video shared by Insulate Britain online, a short recording of Smart, believed to have been taken before she was sent to HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, can be seen in which she defends her actions and called for more civil disobedience.
Smart, an ecologist by trade, said: 'It was quite an extreme campaign, you know, going onto the motorway but we're in an extreme situation and I felt I had to do what was necessary.
'I stepped up, we all need to step up. Non-violent civil disobedience is the only way we're going to enact change.
'We don't need nine of us, or 20 of us in prison, we all need to put our liberty on the line because we are facing losing everything.'
In the clip shared to Twitter, Smart explains her actions leading up to taking part in the mob's motorway protests earlier this year. 
Speaking with a row of fence panels behind her, she said: 'I don't know what more I can do and then IB [Insulate Britain] came along and yes, this was a way I could step up. 
'It was quite an extreme campaign, you know, going onto the motorway but we're in an extreme situation and I felt I had to do what was necessary.
'So I feel this is the moment. Our government could have accepted and acted or done something meaningful in relation to our demands.
'But they chose to imprison us and really that has got to send a strong message to everyone. Now is the time. We need to come together, whatever we're doing is not enough. 
'I stepped up, we all need to step up. Non-violent civil disobedience is the only way we're going to enact change.
'We don't need nine of us, or 20 of us in prison, we all need to put our liberty on the line because we are facing losing everything.
'Our life support systems are collapsing, society is going to collapse. Be part of that change while you have the chance.' 
Insulate Britain have been contacted for comment. 
Following two months of repeated motorway chaos caused by Insulate Britain, Smart told the High Court that she was there to 'ensure future survival' and compared watching the climate crisis to watching a child trapped in a burning house. 
'She said: 'I'm asking when you consider my sentence that my actions are proportionate to the crisis we are facing, where 8,500 people die a year from cold and hunger in their own homes. I cannot stand by and watch. 
'I would run to them. Our Government is betraying us, our vulnerable people and our children's future. I will not be a bystander while our Government fails and betrays its people, I will continue to do what is necessary.'  
This week, Smart was sent to HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, which was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in 2004. Up to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 people in each one.  
Announcing her intention to go on hunger strike after being jailed, 44-year-old Smart said: 'Our Government is betraying us, betraying our vulnerable people and betraying our children's future. 
'I believe that my intentions are morally right, even if my actions are deemed legally wrong. This court may see me as being on the wrong side of the law, but in my heart I know I am on the right side of history. I will not be a bystander.' 
She told the court that the proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways. 
But Smart, a biologist, has previously been criticised for undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her partner, Andy Smith.
Mr Smith, 45, who volunteers as a climate activist full time but has not taken part in any demonstrations with Extinction Rebellion offshoot Insulate Britain, said he is 'terrified' for her. Mr Smith said he was aware that Smart would be going on a hunger strike if she was put behind bars, adding: 'It's something we discuss quite frequently'. 
He added: 'She is incredibly resolute in her actions. I stand by her in all the decisions she makes. Morally they are in the right in this instance and she really stands by her convictions. 
'She's an incredibly passionate person who has spent her whole entire adult life trying to save wildlife and protect the environment. 
'That's deeply ingrained in who she is. That freedom to go out on to the street and protest has been taken away from her, so her going on a hunger strike in prison is another way to continue that process.'
He added that the sentences were less than the supporters of the group were expecting so they were 'relieved', but still felt it was a 'complete injustice'. 
He said: 'I completely stand with them on what they've done and how they've acted. I would obviously rather the judge side with them but they did break the law and then they were willing to face the consequences of breaking the law.' ",-2
15,"Budget Champagnes from Sainsbury's, Tesco and Lidl have beaten bottles from high-end brands costing three times as much in a Which? blind taste test. 
An expert panel of judges sampled 19 non-vintage champagnes from supermarkets and best-selling brands for the consumer group's annual Christmas report.
Waitrose Blanc De Noirs Brut NV Champagne, £24, was declared the overall winner, with a score of 82%. 
Second place went to Co-op Les Pionniers Non-Vintage Champagne, £19, with a score of 81%, followed by M&S Champagne Delacourt Brut NV, £20, at 81%.
Lidl's Veuve Delattre Champagne Brut NV, which at £12.49 was the cheapest bottle tasted, scored 77% and was named best value. It came in sixth overall. 
In contrast, Moët & Chandon Brut Imperial NV Champagne, £38, scored 73% and Piper-Heidsieck Brut Champagne, £35, scored 71%. Both finished outside the top 10. 
Supermarkets were asked to nominate two widely available champagnes that they thought would stand up to the bestselling brands, including a premium own label costing up to £38 and, if available, a second, lower-priced own label champagne.
Each member of the panel tasted the champagnes in a different order to avoid any bias. 
After all the champagnes had been tasted, the panel agreed on a score for each bottle and which ones deserved to be Best Buys. 
Results proved a higher price does not always mean a higher quality bottle, with supermarket wines dominating the top 10. Sainsbury's Lidl 
Which? commented that Lidl's 'Great Value' Champagne was 'the cheapest on test, yet it outshone many pricier rivals'. 
Lidl's Veuve Delattre Champagne Brut NV received a higher rating than bottles from some of the top Champagne houses.
It was was the cheapest bottle the experts tested, at around £26 less than the price of those by the more renowned brands. 
The Lidl champagne scored higher than £35 a bottle Piper-Heidsieck Brut and £36-a-bottle Taittinger Brut Reserve N/V.  
Richard Bampfield, Lidl's Master of Wine, commented: 'The results of this expert blind-tasting are a well-deserved endorsement for what truly is a great value bottle of Champagne.  
'Proving once again that Lidl cannot be beaten on price or quality! 
Lidl's Veuve Delattre Champagne Brut NV is a brilliant option for those looking to save and impress over the festive period.'",-2
16,"Rowdy Brits threw caution to the wind to defy the woke mob as they dressed as migrants in inflatable boats, North Korean leader Kim Jon Un and saucy nuns - all while ignoring a Covid ban - and took part in an annual costume event through the streets of Benidorm on Thursday.  
Local media including NIUS reported that over 20,000 people, largely Brits, attended the annual 'Fancy Dress Party' in the Spanish seaside resort of Benidorm on Thursday.
According to local media outlet Actualitat Valenciana, the event had been officially cancelled this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but British revellers decided to hold it anyway, and the police, unable to prevent it, could only patrol it.
Pictures from the event showed tens of thousands of people rubbing shoulders and not a face mask in sight. 
One video showed a group of men walking down the street dressed up as channel migrants, wearing life jackets and carrying an orange inflatable dingy boat. Another group were seen in costume as Pacific islanders, while one man was wore a Kim Jong-un mask and a 'Squid Game' tracksuit.
As of yesterday, Spain had a total of 5.07million confirmed cases since the beginning of the pandemic and 87,804 deaths.
Of these figures, 6,315 cases and 29 deaths had come in the last 24 hours. 
Despite the uptick in COVID-19 cases, locals were dismayed to see throngs of Brits flocking together in such numbers that they no could longer fit in the bars and spilled out onto the streets instead.
Photos taken at the event show not a single face mask in sight, despite the latest statistics showing a coronavirus infection rate of 353 cases for every 100,000 inhabitants.
The Costa Blanca capital's infection rate is an astonishing four times higher than the average for the wider Valencian Community, and it is believed tourism is largely to blame.
According to NIUS, the authorities had tried to avoid the party spilling out onto the streets at all costs, but in the end, the pubs filled up and they were simply unable to contain the numbers.
Benidorm's annual Fancy Dress Party is regularly a big hit with Brits, who have been flocking to the Mediterranean tourist destination in large numbers since the package holiday explosion in the 1960s.
Pre-COVID, the event attracted up to 50,000 revellers, according to Actualitat Valenciana.
The costume party is held every year on a Thursday following the Major Patron Festivities of Benidorm Costumes and features various kinds of music, paella and colourful floats.
This event, which fills the streets of the so-called 'English quarter' every year, is billed as Europe's biggest fancy dress party.
It began more than 20 years ago and has been growing in numbers ever since, with similarly outrageous costumes seen in previous years.",-2
17,"Double child killer Colin Pitchfork has been arrested and recalled to prison, the Ministry of Justice said, after he was released two months ago.
Pitchfork, now 61, was arrested by police officers for 'concerning behaviour' and taken in for processing just two months after he was freed after 33 years in prison.
Under the cover of darkness, the sexual predator was taken from Leyhill open prison, in Tortworth, Gloucs., to a hostel in the south of England, where he was greeted by other residents and staff. 
In September, it was revealed he had been placed near three schools and two nurseries, with pictures showing him prowling the streets as a free man.
Pitchfork, who was imprisoned for life in 1988 for the rape and murder of two 15-year-old girls, is facing a standard recall - which in theory means he could be re-released into public life again in 28 days. 
But sources told the Sun his past life of crime means he is almost guaranteed an audience before an official Parole Board hearing within the next six months to determine his fate.
The source said it could be 'years' before he was released into public life again, adding: 'Pitchfork’s licence conditions were so tough that if he stepped out of line he faced recall.  
'Now he has done just that. His behaviour caused great concern and that was behind it.
'He kept going for long walks alone which in itself was alarming. It’s thought his attitude and fears he was hiding things were also a problem.'
Pitchfork strangled his first victim Lynda Mann, in Narborough, Leicestershire, in November 1983. He killed Dawn Ashworth three years later in the neighbouring village of Enderby. 
He became the first person to be convicted using DNA evidence after he had tried to evade capture by persuading a work colleague to take a blood test for him during the murder hunt.
Reacting to the news he would be returning to a life of incarceration today, his second victim's mother, Barbara Ashworth, said she was 'pleased' the child killer has been recalled to prison.
She said: 'I'm pleased that he's been put away and women and girls are safe and protected from him now.
'It's a safer place when he's behind bars and I won't have to worry about other people being hurt by him for the time being.
'But there's always the worry that he might get out again, he seems to have a lot of people on his side who give him the benefit of the doubt.
'But for now, I have to be pleased about the news.' 
Pitchfork was freed after the Parole Board rejected the Government and his devastated victims' families' legal challenge. 
In a clear indication of the threat he still posed, he was subject to some of the strictest licence conditions ever set.
The killer will wear an electronic tag so he can be monitored at all times, banned from going near the relatives of his victims and face restrictions on using the internet by himself.
He also faced on-the-spot lie detector tests to see whether he has broken any conditions.
He is also banned from approaching children and will be on the sex offenders register for life. Pitchfork’s hostel had a small garden, a pool table and runs a cooking club for residents. 
Pitchfork raped and strangled Lynda in Narborough after dropping his wife off at an evening class and while his baby son slept in the back of his car.
Three years later, he raped and murdered Dawn in a similar attack in nearby Enderby. 
The killer was the first criminal to be caught by the revolutionary DNA profiling process pioneered by Sir Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester.
He was eventually caught after the world's first mass screening for DNA, as 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples.
No matches were found. 
But in 1987 a bakery colleague of Pitchfork - who had been there as an apprentice and had expressed a desire to set up his own cake-making business - was overheard boasting how he was set to receive £200 to pose as Pitchfork and give a sample.
The conversation was reported to the police and Pitchfork was later arrested. He was jailed for life in 1988.  
His minimum term of imprisonment was set at 30 years, later reduced to 28 years in 2009 on appeal.
Pitchfork's early release from a life sentence in the summer prompted furious relatives of his victims to speak out.
Barbara Ashworth, the mother of Pitchfork’s second victim Dawn Ashworth, said: ‘This man should not be breathing the same air as us. He should not be walking the streets again.’  
Rebecca Eastwood, the sister of Pitchfork’s first victim Lynda Mann, said: ‘Why has he been placed near a number of schools? I just hope the pictures will mean people will now be able to be on their guard.’
Miss Eastwood, of Liverpool, added: ‘Please remember his face and stay clear of him and keep your children safe. There is no way a man who committed these crimes can change.’
The families of both victims had accused the Parole Board of putting children at risk by ignoring concerns from experts, especially over Pitchfork’s ‘future sexual interests’. 
Alberto Costa, MP for South Leicestershire, where Pitchfork committed his crimes, said: 'I was informed earlier this evening by the Policing Minister that double child rapist and killer Colin Pitchfork has been recalled to prison. 
'Pitchfork’s behaviour has given sufficient cause for concern to the probation authorities. 
'Pitchfork is under the most stringent of licence conditions and perhaps this recall evidences that those conditions are working. I will urgently take this matter up with the government to ensure that public safety remains the number one focus.'
DNA evidence - then in its early use in criminal cases - played a key role in solving the murders of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.
It was first used in the investigation following the death of Pitchfork's first victim - Lynda Mann.
Then 15, Lynda was grabbed, raped and murdered as she walked home from babysitting earlier that day.
DNA was used at the start of the investigation, when a sample of semen taken from her body was found to be from a person with type-A blood.
It also matched an enzyme profile of just 10 per cent of males.
But with few leads and no direct suspects, police left the case open.
In 1986, a second 15-year-old girl, Dawn Ashworth, left her home to visit a friend's house.
When she did not return, a search was launched and, like Lynda, her body was found having been raped.
Police again found similar DNA, and with the murder having been carried out in a similar way, detectives realised they were looking for a double murderer.
Officers had another suspect in mind at the time, Richard Buckland - a 17-year-old with learning difficulties who had confessed to the second murder and had knowledge of the first. He would later be exonerated.
But it wasn't until Sir Alec Jeffreys, a genetics researcher at nearby Leicester University, became involved that his innocence was proved. 
Sir Alec first developed genetic profiling along with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett.
And he used it to compare DNA samples found on both bodies.
It proved the killer was the same person - but not Buckland.
Later, police launched a DNA drive and up to 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples.
However, no matches were found.
But in 1987 a bakery colleague of Pitchfork was overheard boasting how he was set to receive £200 to pose as Pitchfork and give a sample.
The conversation was reported to the police and Pitchfork was later arrested. ",-2
18,"The Bank of England’s new chief economist has cast doubt on the likelihood of a rise in interest rates before Christmas.
Huw Pill, who took over from Andy Haldane this summer, said there was a growing need to take action to bring inflation back under control.
But he said there was no guarantee that such a move would come next month, adding: ‘I genuinely do not know today how I will vote.’
Speaking at an economics conference in Bristol yesterday, Mr Pill admitted that he was ‘looking perhaps for reasons not to hike rates’.
And he warned that interest rate rises – when they come – may be steeper than expected.
It had been assumed rates would rise to 0.25 per cent and then go up by 25 so-called ‘basis points’ thereafter – such as from 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent.
But Mr Pill said: ‘I don’t want to give an impression that there is a piece of data that will come out, and I will look at that and say, “OK, it’s zero or 50 or 25 or 40 basis points”, or whatever.
‘There is an attraction at some point to getting back to a multiple of 0.25, but we are not under pressure to do that immediately.’
His comments came as households across the country face a cost-of-living crisis.
Prices are rising at such a fast pace that inflation has hit 4.2 per cent – its highest level for a decade.
It has sparked speculation that the Bank of England will raise interest rates imminently to bring the cost of living back under control.
But while higher interest rates are typically used to curb inflation, they also make mortgages and other loans more expensive.
Households also face higher taxes, with several hikes due in April, including a rise in national insurance to pay for extra spending on health and social care.
The Bank defied expectations earlier this month by refusing to hike rates from their current record low of 0.1 per cent to 0.25 per cent.
The cost of servicing Britain’s towering national debt more than tripled last month as inflation sent interest payments soaring.
In a bleak report, the Office for National Statistics said the Government spent £5.6 billion on debt interest in October alone.
That amounted to £180 million a day and was more than 200 per cent higher than the £1.8 billion spent servicing the debt in October last year.
The national debt has ballooned to nearly £2.28 trillion, or 95.1 per cent of gross domestic product – a level not seen since the early 1960s. ",-2
19,"NOW Cop26 has drawn to a close, you may be left feeling a little befuddled about how best to do your bit for the planet.
Does it make sense to stop eating imported fruit if you plan to fly to the sun for some much-needed family time next year?
Is a shower more eco-friendly than a soak in the tub?
To answer such questions — and help us better understand the implications of our consumer choices — PROFESSOR MIKE BERNERS-LEE, professor of sustainability at Lancaster University, has calculated the carbon footprint of absolutely everything . . . with some surprising conclusions.
Like most people I don’t particularly enjoy instructions on how to live.
I may have spent 15 years researching the impact of the carbon emissions that are slowly heating our planet.
But I’ve also had plenty of practice in not being quite as good as I’d like to be.
We all want to live our lives responsibly but we have to live. That’s not to say we don’t need to change our habits. We do. We are in a climate emergency. But a sense of scale is required.
A friend once asked how he should best dry his hands to reduce his carbon footprint — with a paper towel or electric drier? This same person flies across the Atlantic dozens of times a year.
The flying is hugely more significant than the hand-drying, so my friend was just distracting himself from the real issue.
The reason I decided to work out the carbon footprint of everything I could think of was to help you get a feel for roughly how much carbon is at stake when you make simple day-to-day choices.
Everything we do has some impact — where we travel to and how, whether we buy an apple in season or asparagus in winter, whether we have a quick shower or luxuriate in the bath.
What is a carbon footprint? It’s a measure of the impact of our activities on the amount of greenhouse gases being produced and released into the atmosphere.
All we consume and do and think about, both at home and work, has a carbon impact — that is, a climate change impact.
But you might be very surprised by some of the things that have a hefty carbon load and some that don’t.
I use a measure called ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ to calculate the volume of harmful gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, refrigerant and other gases) generated in the making and consumption of any product or service.
Take a tomato: any calculation needs to take into account how it was grown (naturally or in a heated greenhouse), the type of fertiliser used (some require a complex manufacturing process, others emit greenhouse gases), and how it was packaged and transported (by road, ship or air, the latter being a carbon disaster).
As a consumer, you need to consider that 1kg of locally grown tomatoes has a carbon footprint of 400g CO2e compared to an astounding 50kg CO2e produced by 1kg of organic, ‘on the vine’ UK cherry tomatoes grown out of season in March.
Choose those tomatoes and they can be the highest-carbon food of all, even though grown here.
Bananas, on the other hand, may travel far before they land in our fruit bowls, but as they tend to be shipped rather than airfreighted and require less packaging because they are protected by their skins, they are a low-carbon — and extremely nutritious — food.
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS BAD FOR PLANET
Gold and diamonds are precious precisely because it takes effort, industry and resources to extract them, and this takes their carbon footprint sky high, particularly for jewellery which comes from far afield (£500 worth of gold and diamonds from Africa has a carbon footprint of 710kg CO2e).
That’s aside from the bad working conditions for some miners. Far better to wear jewellery passed down through the family, re-fashioned from existing gems or made from natural materials like shells.
GROW YOUR OWN BOUQUETS
Out-of-season cut flowers are bad news for climate change, because they either have to be put on a plane to get here or grown with artificial heat.
A single red rose may be romantic, but when grown in a Netherlands hothouse or outdoors in Kenya and airfreighted to Europe, it will set you back 2.4kg of CO2e compared to zero carbon for a rose grown in your own garden.
A bouquet a week of imported flowers could add 1.5 tonnes of CO2e a year per person.
Grow your own flowers or look for bouquets of local-grown, seasonal blooms (1.7kg CO2e for 15 UK outdoor-grown stems).
An alternative is indoor plants, which are far less carbon-intensive.
DON'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT A DISHWASHER
A high-efficiency dishwasher always wins on carbon footprint over washing the dishes in hot water as long as you run a full load (between 470g to 600g of CO2e per full load) and particularly if you set it to run at night when electricity demand is low and the grid becomes more efficient.
Rinsing plates before stacking the machine is the worst option and ranks alongside ironing your spouse’s socks. If this is your routine, liberate yourself, sharpish.
ORDER A COFFEE WITHOUT MILK
The quickest way to slash the carbon footprint of your morning coffee (or tea) is to drink it black (49g of CO2e per cup for instant coffee or 87g a cup for a black filter or Americano compared with 235g CO2e for a large cappuccino).
Cow’s milk has such a high emissions toll that even the splash in tea accounts for three quarters of a cuppa’s carbon footprint. For a large latte (552g of CO2e) you could have nine Americanos or 25 cups of black tea.
If you buy takeaways, add 110g of CO2e for the disposable cup. At home, use one sturdy mug and only wash it at the end of the day.
JUST HOW BAD ARE IMPORTED BANANAS?
The distances bananas travel to reach us are vast.
But at just 110g of CO2e each, bananas are actually a great food for anyone who cares about their carbon footprint.
Grown in natural sunlight with no hothousing required, they keep well.
So although they are often grown thousands of miles from the end consumer, they are transported by boat (about one per cent of the carbon footprint of airfreight) and they require hardly any packaging as they have skins.
The only really bad bananas are those you allow to rot in your fruit bowl.
These join the scandalous 22 per cent of food binned by consumers in the UK.
Use overripe bananas in baking or enjoy with lashings of custard.
GO FOR THE UGLIEST APPLE IN THE SHOP
Buy the most misshapen apples. It encourages the supply chain not to chuck less-than-perfect-looking fruits away.
Apples are low-carbon but local and seasonal is best (32g of CO2e per kg). This changes when out of season.
UK apples bought in early summer will be last year’s fruit, which will have been kept refrigerated, so requiring electricity. This makes imported apples (80g of CO2e per kg) a better option.
NO WINTER ASPARAGUS
Perhaps the single most carbon-intensive winter vegetable is fresh asparagus flown in from Peru (4.7kg of CO2e per pack.)
That’s because a mile by air typically has about 100 times the carbon impact of a mile by sea. The same applies to airfreighted baby corn, baby carrots, mangetout, green beans, fine beans, okra, shelled peas, lettuces, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.
Enjoy lashings of UK asparagus in summer (270g of CO2e per pack) then wait a year to eat it again.
THE SCOOP ON THE MOST ECO ICE CREAM
A soft scoop from a van comes with a hefty carbon price tag of 500g of CO2e per cone as the vanilla ice cream’s dairy-based and kept cold in a less efficient mobile refrigeration unit, often belching out diesel fumes.
A chocolate flake makes the footprint of an ice cream higher again, though perhaps we can agree this is a necessary evil.
Opt for a plant-based ice cream for your cone, instead. Better still, buy a choc ice (140g of CO2e) or an ice lolly (70g of CO2e) from a shop, which has a lower figure as its refrigeration will be more efficient.
CROCS ARE TOPS
Shoes vary a lot in their carbon footprint, depending on what they’re made of and how long they last.
Running shoes made in China might come in at 8kg of CO2e a pair, but specialist leather is more (15kg of CO2e).
At the lowest end of the scale are a pair of Crocs, made with just 250g of expanded EVA (foam rubber).
They are sold unpackaged so the carbon toll is just over 1kg CO2e per pair.
ARE REUSABLE NAPPIES THAT SAINTLY?
A cloth nappy may seem better than a disposable but if washed at 90 degrees and tumble-dried to soften, it’ll carry a higher carbon footprint (165g of CO2e per nappy) than a disposable (130g per nappy).
The lowest carbon option is reusable nappies washed at 60 degrees, line dried, and passed on to a second child (60g CO2e per nappy).
Up to 20 per cent of the carbon footprint of a disposable nappy arises from the methane it emits as it rots down in landfill.
Biodegradable disposable nappies break down more rapidly in landfill so give off more of the gas.
WINE BOXES OVER BOTTLES
The bottle usually has a bigger footprint than the wine. Shipping is only a small part, so it doesn’t matter much where your wine comes from.
Far more important are the road miles — in your country and the country of origin.
For this reason, locally produced wine could cut the footprint by 20 per cent (1.3kg CO2e a bottle from Britain or France) and, oddly, I estimate Australian wine shipped to the UK (in huge sealed tanks) probably has a slightly lower footprint (at 1.4kg) than Sicilian transported in bottles by road (1.65kg).
By buying wine boxes or cartons you can reduce the footprint by a factor of about five.
EAT FROZEN BERRIES WHEN IT’S COLD
Fresh strawberries flown in from South Africa in winter or those grown in a hothouse come with an eye-wateringly high carbon cost of 3.65kg CO2e for a 250g punnet.
Far better to eat UK strawberries in summer. Or opt for frozen British berries (770g CO2e for 250g) which are super-nutritious and easier than fresh fruit to eat without wastage, as you can take just what is needed from the freezer.
NEVER, EVER FLY BUSINESS CLASS
Flying, particularly long haul, is bad for the planet. Emissions from airborne planes have a greater impact on greenhouse gases than those burning the same amount of fuel on the ground. A business class seat, as it takes up more room, has a greater percentage of the flight’s total carbon footprint. A single flight is equivalent to using 340,000 plastic bags.
If you do fly, choose economy. Go abroad less often, stay away for longer and only fly to do something you can’t do here in the UK.
RATION BATHS AND TIME YOUR SHOWERS
abandon a daily bath, folks — just have one a week. A quick dip can be anything from 500g to 1.5kg of CO2e depending on your heating system.
Far better to have a quick, daily shower. Five minutes is 160g to 250g of CO2e (depending on your hot water system). You could treat yourself to 15 minutes under a power shower for the 1kg of CO2e you generate running a hot bath.
ONE TAP THAT YOU SHOULD TURN ON
At 400g of CO2e per litre, bottled water is 1,000 times more carbon intense than tap water, so it really pays to ditch the plastic bottles.
The carbon emissions come mainly from packaging and transport, but add 83g CO2e per litre for the plastic, and 20g CO2e to melt the plastic pellets and mould them into bottles.
Transport is also significant because water is so heavy.
SWAP YOUR CAR FOR THE TRAIN 
Trains are generally a lot greener than cars, though a good petrol car can beat a train’s carbon footprint if the car is full of people. Even two people travelling together are better off driving an efficient car than travelling first class by train.
The carbon cost of a train trip depends on how fast it goes (air resistance increases with speed), how many stops there are (each stop wastes energy) and type of fuel used (electricity beats diesel).
Travelling by an Underground train is lower-carbon per passenger mile than an intercity train (68g of CO2e) — mainly because people are packed in so tightly.
YOU MUST EAT YOUR (SOURDOUGH) CRUSTS
Homemade sourdough or locally baked artisan loaf has a smaller carbon footprint than mass-produced sliced bread (630g of CO2e per loaf compared to 1kg of CO2e for mass-produced).
More than 60 per cent of the emissions of all bread production comes from the wheat cultivation (and most of that is the fertilizer used). A third comes from the milling and baking.
Transport is a tiny fraction if bought locally. Buy only what you need and always eat the crusts! Food waste thrown into landfill is very bad news.
Rice, unlike bread, is a surprisingly high-carbon staple (at 4kg to 7.1kg of CO2e per kg depending on planting practices).
This is due to the methane that bubbles out of the flooded paddy fields and the carbon-excessive nitrogen fertilisers that are often applied. This means a kilo of rice can cause more emissions than burning a litre of diesel.

20,"Along with a tendency to be argumentative, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) feature strongly in my family tree.
My father had both, which undoubtedly contributed to his early death at 74, while my mother's family are prone to strokes, which again are closely linked to raised blood sugar levels and raised blood pressure. 
So I assume that I carry some pretty dodgy genes, and that's why I keep a blood sugar testing kit and a blood pressure monitor at home and keep a close eye on both.
Around half of British adults have hypertension, while a third have raised blood sugar, and most don't know they have it because they haven't been tested. 
But although these two conditions are treated as if separate, there's increasing evidence they're actually closely intertwined. 
And the bad news is that if you have both, it quadruples your risk of a heart attack or stroke, as well as increasing your risk of dementia.
The good news is that if you treat one, there's a high chance you'll also improve the other — for reasons we don't understand, lowering your blood pressure cuts your risk of type 2 diabetes.
This was confirmed in a study in The Lancet this week, which showed that bringing down someone's blood pressure, with medication or lifestyle changes, will not only have a big effect on reducing their risk of heart attack and stroke, but also their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
The study, which involved more than 145,000 people, showed that even a very modest drop in blood pressure cut your chances of type 2 diabetes by 11 per cent. But there was a sting in the tail: not all blood pressure drugs had a positive impact.
While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor II blockers lowered the diabetes risk, thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers increased it by 20 and 48 per cent respectively — possibly because the different drugs work in very different ways.
So what can you do if you want to reduce your blood pressure without relying on medication? 
Losing weight is a simple but powerful tool; cutting back on salt and becoming more active can also help. My other suggestions include:
TRY SINGING 
I enjoy belting out songs while I am driving or in the shower — and fortunately, research shows that singing is a good way to reduce the stress hormone, cortisol, which in turn should reduce your blood pressure and blood sugar levels (cortisol boosts your blood sugar levels by converting protein into glucose).   
And it can work pretty instantaneously: I remember, some years ago, seeing a middle-aged patient who was in hospital for an operation, but her blood pressure was so high that the surgeons were anxious about operating. 
She began singing quietly to herself, and within 20 minutes her blood pressure had fallen enough for the operation to proceed.
TAKE A HOT BATH 
A daily immersion in hot water can help lower blood pressure —the heat makes your blood vessels expand, reducing the work the heart has to do to make blood pump around your body, 
This was confirmed in a Japanese study published last year, based on data from 30,000 people over 20 years.
Researchers found the people who had a hot bath most days had a 28 per cent lower risk of heart disease and a 26 per cent lower risk of stroke than those who bathed less than twice a week.
EATING DARK CHOCOLATE 
Eating dark chocolate (more than 75 per cent cocoa) can reduce blood pressure almost immediately — this is because it contains significant amounts of flavanols, compounds that can, among other things, cause your arteries to relax and expand.
A few years ago, I took part in an experiment where researchers used an ultrasound to measure the stiffness of my arteries before and after eating a couple of squares of dark chocolate. 
To my surprise, there was clear improvement after the chocolate, accompanied by a drop in my blood pressure. Sadly you don't get the same effect with milk chocolate.
VISIT THE ZOO - IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PET!  
I love my family dog, Tari, a King Charles spaniel, but having looked into the health benefits of having a dog, I feel she is also remarkable value for money. 
For starters, she encourages me to go for daily walks, which is good for my blood pressure. 
A study of residents in a new housing estate in Perth, Western Australia, found people who owned dogs walked 30 minutes more a week, and had lower blood pressure, than those who didn't.
If you don't have a pet, then visiting a zoo can also be beneficial. 
In a 2010 study, researchers in Japan found that after a day at the zoo, not only did the study participants walk, on average, 6,000 steps more than normal but they also experienced significant drops in their blood pressure. 
Exercise makes your heart stronger, so it can pump blood with less effort, which reduces the force on your arteries and therefore blood pressure.
PRACTISE BREATHING 
WE think we know how to breathe — after all, we'd be dead if not — but there are clear benefits from practising slow, deep breaths.
This activates our parasympathetic nervous system (which controls our stress response) and in turn reduces heart rate and dilates our blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.
One of the simplest types of breathing exercise, which I do for a few minutes most days, is called four-two-four. 
This involves breathing in through the nose to a count of four, holding it for two seconds, then breathing out through the mouth to a count of four. Very calming.
You can catnap with your dog  
I was very surprised recently when a leading sleep researcher told me she shares her bed with two dogs.
I've always assumed that dogs in the bedroom, let alone on the bed, are a disaster for sleep. 
Our dog, Tari, isn't even allowed upstairs, though I know she sneaks up when she thinks we're not around.
There's not much research on the impact of sharing your bed with a dog. But a key study in 2017 by the Mayo Clinic in the U.S., which looked at sleep efficiency — the amount of time we spend actually asleep — found it was around 80 per cent when there was a dog on the bed, and 83 per cent when it's in the room (85 per cent or more sleep efficiency is considered excellent).
This meant the dog's owners lost around 14 minutes of sleep a night (though the dogs themselves slept just as soundly on the bed or in the room).
But while sharing with your dog may not be overly disruptive to your sleep, once a dog becomes used to it, it will howl if excluded. 
And, like humans, they get more restless as they get older.
WATCH OUT FOR VEGAN JUNK FOOD  
My wife, Clare, and I have been looking at how to cut our carbon footprint. As well as keeping our house chilly, for instance, we're thinking about going more vegan.
There's plenty of evidence that meat and dairy production makes a big contribution to the release of atmosphere-warming gases, and clearly lots of others feel the same, with the number of Brits eating and drinking only plant-based foods nearly doubling in a decade.
Two things are currently holding me back. The first is that I love dairy and struggle with plant-based milks. 
But also I'm not entirely sold on all of the alleged health benefits.
Yes, if you cook your meals from scratch, make sure you're getting enough protein and supplement with the necessary vitamins, then a vegan diet can be really healthy. 
The trouble is that food manufacturers are now rushing out all sorts of vegan-based ultra-processed foods, such as vegan sausage rolls, that are unlikely to be healthier than meat alternatives.
For instance, a survey by Action On Salt in 2018 found that some meat-free burgers contained 15 per cent more salt than the meat ones.
And a recent study in the Journal of Nutrition, involving 21,000 people, found that the vegans were eating the most junk food, with 39 per cent of their diet made up of ultra-processed foods, compared to 33 per cent for meat eaters.
So I might give it a go in Veganuary (trying to eat only vegan in January) but I'll certainly need to get in more recipe books and start practising firsT.",-2
21,"A picture showing a grinning Prince Andrew was on display at Jeffery Epstein's notorious 'Pleasure Palace' where he was accused of molesting teenage girls.
The image, which sat next to a framed photograph of billionaire paedophile Epstein at his former Florida retreat in Palm Beach, shows a smiling Andrew apparently in military uniform in his younger years.
The Duke of York, 61, had previously denied making frequent visits to Epstein's Florida home, despite the former housekeeper Juan Alessi claiming Andrew spent 'weeks at a time' at the property when he was working there.
Sources warned the revelation of a picture being proudly displayed at Epstein's home was 'incredibly damaging' for the embattled royal.
One told the Sun: 'Epstein cultivated powerful friends and would show them off in pictures around all of his homes.
'This is incredibly damaging for Prince Andrew because it shows how highly Jeffrey prized his friendship with a senior member of the Royal Family. His picture was shown off in Jeffrey's home like a trophy.'
Sources indicated the scandal-hit royal faces further public scrutiny as news of the picture emerged.
The source continued: 'Andrew's reputation is hit every time something like this emerges - and he is already facing another year of further lurid headlines.'
In his 2019 Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew admitted he had visited Epstein's Florida home, but denied making repeated visits.
He explained: 'I definitely did not visit his Palm Beach house three or four times a year, absolutely not. In total, probably four times in total throughout the time that I knew him.
'In fact probably that was the place that...if you see what I mean, he was in the house more there than in other...in other places that I was at. But it was usually because I was going...I was going through and on somewhere else so it was a day, that was it.'  
Other newly released pictures showed the financier donning a kilt as he poses with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is pictured elsewhere riding a motorbike near Scotland's Skibo Castle. 
Friday marked the latest development in the Epstein saga, as the Duke of York faces a US lawsuit from Virginia Roberts Giuffre who claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew.
The Duke of York also faced a fresh headache this week when campaigners and experts warned his finances should be investigated by MPs and tax authorities.
Prince Andrew faced mounting scrutiny on Tuesday over whether he broke the Royal Family’s conduct rules by accepting a £1.5million off-shore payment from Tory donor and long-term friend David Rowland.
The Queen’s scandal-hit second son received the payment days before he paid off a loan from the financier’s own Luxembourg bank.
Buckingham Palace conduct rules state that royals should ‘never accept gifts of money, or money equivalent, in connection with an official engagement or duty’.
The Duke of York has previously been accused of attending naked pool parties and receiving massages by Epstein's former butler Juan Alessi, 70.  
Alessi, who started working for Epstein in 1991, has previously been interviewed by the FBI, police and victims' lawyers and said the Prince stayed for 'weeks at a time' in a sworn statement to Palm Beach police in 2005.  
Prince Andrew has consistently denied all sexual allegations made against him.  
Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges that alleged he abused women and girls under the age 18 at the Florida estate and his Manhattan mansion in the early 2000s. 
The waterfront property became the epicentre where he groomed and sexually assaulted underage girls and women as part of a sprawling sex trafficking scheme, prosecutors said.
The house was where the crimes that would eventually lead to his downfall were first reported in 2005.
Epstein had been recruiting underage girls for 'massages' from Palm Beach high school and one eventually confessed to her mother what was going on, who then went to the police.
The girls would be hired to massage Epstein in their underwear or totally naked. Often the massages progressed to sexual touching as Epstein allegedly used vibrators on the girls and masturbated.
He paid them hundreds of dollars at a time with another $200 going to other schoolgirls who recruited them to go to mansion on Palm Beach's El Brillo Way.
Dozens of victims were underprivileged middle and high school girls recruited in and around Palm Beach County between 1998 and 2006.
Earlier this year, demolition crews ripped down the notorious Palm Beach mansion where the financier sexually assaulted young girls. 
The property, which had stood since 1952 and was bought by Epstein in 1990 for around £2million, included a main house, a pool cabana building and another staff house - all of which were demolished.  
Developer Todd Michael Glaser purchased the sprawling Palm Beach estate for $18.5million (£13.7m) and he sighed 'finally' as the first bulldozers began raising the house of horrors to the ground on April 18.
Glaser, who has previously said it would be personally satisfying to tear down the mansion due to its horrific history, said he plans to replace it with a 14,000-square-foot 'Art Moderne home'.",-2
22,"The soldier's voice requesting air support burst onto the radio in my cockpit. 
'Dragon' — my call sign — 'are you visual with three Isis fighters running to the east? They pose an imminent threat. We need a strike on these targets immediately. How long will it take you to set up?'
'About 60 seconds,' I replied as with the lightest touch on the controls I eased my Typhoon jet fighter — the RAF's newest supersonic combat aircraft — into a left turn, staying high over the advancing Isis forces.
The soldier's voice came back on, rushed, pressing. He was a joint terminal attack controller (JTAC), our eyes on the ground, a specialist trained in coordinating air support. 'Dragon cleared to engage,' he sang out.
It was spring 2016 and for more than a year the world had looked on in horror as terrorists in convoys of pickup trucks crossed Iraq and Syria, killing everyone who stood in their path.
They had seized an area of territory the size of France, killing tens of thousands, taken control of Mosul, a cosmopolitan city of two million, and planted their black flags over what they called the Islamic State.
Isis gunmen and suicide bombers had also crept into Europe. In November 2015, 130 people were butchered and another 416 injured on the streets of Paris in the worst violence seen in France since World War II.
The West had decided to take action and the RAF's 1 (Fighter) Squadron — of which I was commanding officer — had been dispatched to the Middle East. 
And now, flying from our base in Cyprus, we were in the thick of the action over the badlands of Islamic State.
Ever since I was 16 I had dreamt of being a pilot, after the captain of an airliner bringing me home from a holiday in France invited me onto the flight deck. 
I remember gazing out along the line of the wing and beyond to the horizon.
And I could see the big murmuring engine, the silver-white glow of the wing tip edging up and down in the evening air as the sun slid into the dark waves of the Atlantic. I was hooked. I told my dad: 'I'm going to become a pilot.'
It became an obsession. At home my eyes always turned skywards to watch the Hercules transport aircraft flying into nearby RAF Lyneham and the Chinooks thumping over my school at low level on their way to Salisbury Plain.
It was mind-blowing, terrifying and hugely appealing. And now, 20 or so years later, here I was, leading my own squadron into battle in the most modern, most powerful multi-role jet in the world, one I felt emotionally connected to and trusted with my life.
The Typhoon is a beauty of an aircraft, balanced with fine lines and carved like a postmodern sculpture. It was brilliantly designed and intuitive, making it easy to fly after just a few sessions in the simulator.
Climbing into the cockpit felt as if you were entering the space age. The layout was simple, almost sterile, with all the information the pilot needed on the head- up display and three-colour TV screens.
With its two massive Rolls-Royce engines, its thrust and manoeuvrability were beyond anything I had ever imagined possible. 
At any altitude, engaging the afterburners caused an acceleration that felt like a kick in the back. From take-off, it took you almost vertically skywards.
It could reach a top speed of Mach 1.8, almost twice the speed of sound, and would climb at more than 10,000 ft a minute. It had totally carefree handling. 
You could snap the control column back as hard as you liked at any speed and it would be impossible to overstress the airframe.
It was impossible to stall, spin or lose control. If you slowed down too much, a warning voice that sounded like Judi Dench playing M in the Bond films would rebuke you through the headset: 'Slow speed, recover . . . slow speed, recover.'
Judi always had the last word. If you ignored her and persisted to the point where a normal jet would spin out of control, she would simply remark, 'Override', and an autopilot system would momentarily engage, advance the throttles, lower the nose, and hand the jet back to you at a safe airspeed a couple of seconds later.
Being shot down or ejecting over hostile territory were everpresent anxieties in the back of my mind. 
I imagined all pilots thought about how they might use the Glock pistols we were issued if the worst happened. I know I had. 
News reports talk about hero pilots steering away from populated areas before ejecting. But, more often than not, where the aircraft crashes is merely chance. 
Ejections are often the last-gasp option. On operations over Iraq and Syria, an ejection into the hands of Isis risked brutality.
Pilots would attempt to escape and evade, coping with whatever injuries. 
Search-and-rescue teams would be called into action, but time would always be in short supply. 
For me, the conduct-after-capture course lingers in my memory like an old scar: seven days and sleepless nights of escape and evasion training on Bodmin Moor, hunted by Royal Marines with blackened faces and night vision equipment. 
Everyone gets caught. 
You then spend four hours in stress positions, being grilled by interrogators who shout inches from your face. 
The experience was exhausting, but you knew you were in a phoney cell somewhere in Cornwall and a recovery night out in Newquay was imminent. 
Psychological training like this would be of some help against a conventional enemy, but the brutality carried out by Isis had shifted the paradigm and weighed heavily in the back of our minds. 
The relaxed handling of a Typhoon allowed the pilot to concentrate on fighting — and in the world of air combat, where a battle can be won or lost in a fraction of a second, this marginal gain was a total game-changer.
Its armaments were formidable — a cannon loaded with armour-piercing 27 mm shells, four 500 lb precision bombs, long-range radar-guided missiles and short-range infrared heat-seeking missiles.
Even so, it was not impregnable, nor risk-free. Out there in the desert, the enemy were armed with infrared guided missiles procured on the black market with stolen oil money. 
We would stay out of the range of small arms, but no aircraft can fly high enough to avoid all the different types of surface-to-air missile.
From my cockpit I trained the targeting camera onto the desert below, where a frenzied and fast moving battle was raging on the outskirts of Ramadi, to the west of Baghdad.
It was hot with the sun burning down, and it must have been deafening for the troops on the ground as large calibre rounds sailed through the air and exploded in mushrooms of rock dust that sailed off in yellow- tinted streamers.
I could clearly see a trench line running east to west, from which Isis soldiers were attacking Iraqi troops, running along it, climbing out, letting off rounds of gunfire, and returning again to the trench or darting forward towards the city.
Others were in open fields, with rocket-propelled grenade launchers over their shoulders, moving towards Baghdad. 
Fighters were advancing or retreating in ways that defied logic, as if there were no overall command, just a general order for a mass attack.
Our job, in this mayhem, was to place high-explosive weapons — released at high speed and high altitude — into precise, bullseye locations. 
If we didn't get these attacks inch perfect, we could easily kill the Iraqi friendlies whose lives we were there to protect.
We had to keep emotions under control as we tried to work out who was who.
On the screen I could see the three Isis fighters race across a field. They separated. Two ran to the north and set up a new firing position.
The third continued along an irrigation channel, stooped with rifle in hand, then threw himself down against a bank of earth and opened fire on the friendlies once more from a different angle.
We needed to split the Typhoon formation and strike both groups. I glanced across at my wingman, Nick Callinswood, known as Cal. He was about a mile away and slightly high, his jet appearing like a grey dart against the chalky blue sky.
'Dragon 2, are you visual with the individual who just broke from the three?'
'Affirm,' Cal answered.
'Your target. We'll prosecute simultaneously.'
Using a home-on-laser weapon, I slewed the camera to put the target in the cross-hairs, then pressed down hard with my thumb on the red weapon release button. I felt a small thud through the airframe as a laser-guided bomb was unleashed into the airflow.
I heard Cal release, too, moments later. We struck both targets. The earth erupted. The three fighters were killed outright. Their motionless bodies were clearly visible.
My breathing raced in the oxygen mask. God, I've just killed someone again. How can this be allowed? How on earth did I end up doing this?
They were killing us all over Europe. Now here we are killing them all over the Middle East. It all seemed terribly wrong, a huge failure of humankind. I felt no satisfaction; I was just numb.
At one level, I was simply doing the job I had signed on to do. When applying for Cranwell, the RAF's college for officers, I had told the two starched officers who interviewed me that I wanted to join the RAF because I was patriotic, that I wanted to serve my country.
But, now here on the front line, it was all so relentless and all-consuming, as if we were machines.
Just act and react, scan the systems and defensive computers, fly the jet, avoid the clouds, monitor the weapons, slew the cameras, assess the fuel burn, watch for the restricted airspace, track the enemy, ensure the rules of engagement are met, keep communicating with the JTAC, keep monitoring for collateral damage, work out where I need to be in one minute, guess what could catch me out the next.
But there was no time to dwell further. There never is. Beneath us, the fighting raged on. The attack controller was straight back on the line to me. 'Dragon. Confirm you have the 27 mm today?' He was referring to the cannon loaded with armour- piercing 27 mm shells.
'Affirm. We have 27 mm.'
'Roger that,' he replied. 'I've got a gun target for you. Enemy fighters hidden in a scrappy bush pinning down friendly troops. Standby for the talk-on.'
A gun target! We were almost clean out of bombs but such was the severity of the situation on the ground that the commanders of the operation wanted to resort to strafing the ground with fast jet cannon fire.
It would be the first operational use of the Typhoon's gun, and a first for me, too. My throat was dry and sweat was streaming down my neck. Strafing was always risky because it meant going in really low, right on top of the enemy.
In order to fire with accuracy, I'd have to dive right into the mix, at risk from every single weapon on the ground. No aircraft has protection against bullets from high calibre rifles, not even the Typhoon.
What if it all went wrong? My heart quickened. Ejecting in these circumstances was a horrific prospect. I could feel the fully-loaded Glock pistol in a holster resting snugly against my chest, though I wasn't sure what good this would be if I had to parachute into hostile territory.
The last airman captured by the jihadis had been shoved in a cage and burned alive in front of a baying mob, the video of his murder uploaded for the world to see on the internet. I might not come out of this alive.
This thought and a thousand others reeled through my mind and were instantly wiped like raindrops from a windscreen.
Complete and absolute focus was required. I was calm as I considered the task ahead. The cannon was fixed to the airframe, so during a strafe attack, you need to line up the aircraft itself and physically aim the 27 mm rounds at the mark.
Fly at 500 mph, descend at thousands of feet per minute, and squeeze the trigger at the precise time to hit the target. 
If I fired too early, the rounds would scatter during the flight and likely miss. If I fired too late, I would potentially fly right into the fragmentation from the bullets, or worse, into the ground.
The gunsight showed a single dot, which had to be placed on the target. If the sight was just a millimetre away from the target, the bullets would miss by hundreds of feet. 
I would get one chance only. My intention was to fire the supersonic rounds in a long burst of two to three seconds.
So I threw the Typhoon into a right turn to line up for the attack, turning my head as far as I could over my shoulder to keep sight of the target — but, as I flew away, it turned from a sizeable bush to a tiny speck vanishing to almost nothing.
To make things even more tricky, it stood in an indistinguishable scrub in miles of open desert. The potential to lose sight of that exact piece of undergrowth or confuse it with another was huge. I took mental snapshots of the surrounding features.
Things happen fast in a jet. After 20 seconds, I turned and made the target out in the distance. Ten seconds to go. Adrenaline was coursing through my veins.
From the ground, the jet would have been heard as nothing more than a faint rumble, masked by the noise of the ongoing battle. If the Isis fighters had spotted me at this stage, I would have appeared as nothing more than an indistinct dot high in the sky, several miles off and flying away from them.
This gave me the edge I needed to make the attack a complete surprise.
With a flick of the wrist, I overbanked the Typhoon onto the line of attack. I pulled the nose down through the horizon, settling into a 30-degree dive, and rolled the wings to level.
I brought the throttles back to idle, to keep the engine noise low. I wanted to arrive silently out of the sun. The speed was building. I would be on them from three miles away in less than 30 seconds.
My heart felt like it was going to burst through my flying suit. Sweat stung my eyes. Do. Not. Screw. This. Up. 400 knots. Five seconds to go. 450 knots. Speed increasing. 
All my effort, all my concentration, all my focus was on that aiming point. I rested the index finger of my right hand on the trigger. Three seconds to go. Almost 500 knots. 
The whole airframe pulsed as I started to fire. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. The 27 mm rounds were in the air travelling at 4,000 ft per second. 
The ground was rising up fast around my ears. The aircraft ground proximity warning was screaming. 
PULL UP! 
Instantaneously I released the trigger, pulled back on the stick and started climbing at 30 degrees nose up. 
At this moment I was at my most vulnerable and felt very alone. If the Isis fighters hadn't seen me approach, they would definitely see me now, just a few hundred feet above them. 
I sent out infrared countermeasures to decoy any missiles and, with the ground falling away fast, I slammed the throttles forward. 
The Rolls-Royce engines kicked to life with a roar that bounced across the flat desert landscape, propelling the jet skywards like a rocket. Through 10,000 ft, through 15,000 ft and climbing. I levelled off and breathed again. 
The controller came on the radio. 'Dragon. Looks like we've had some effect, but some rounds went slightly long. Need an immediate re-attack.' 
'Roger.' I still had one laser-guided bomb left in the armoury. I circled straight back, keeping the cross-hairs fixed on the target, and released. 
Thirty seconds later, the weapon slammed precisely into the stretch of bushes and left nothing but a plume of smoke and a deep scar in the landscape. The Isis firing stopped. I headed back towards base. 
An hour later, I caught the first glimpse of the hazy Mediterranean sea-line and the beginning of a pale sunset. I consciously relaxed my shoulders and stretched as much as the limited space would allow. 
The tension eased. It had been one hell of a day. We had walked to the jets at 0800 that morning. It was now approaching 1600. In those eight hours I had barely paused for breath. 
We had been right in the thick of it, and had caused one hell of a lot of casualties. 
Yes , what we had done had saved the lives of many of the Iraqi soldiers on the ground, but later, in hindsight, I would dwell on the extreme violence we'd left in our wake. 
We were completely focused on delivering precise air support in highly complex scenarios with ruthless, professional efficiency. But where was my empathy? Where was my compassion? 
It seemed I had constructed a hard shell around me. When there were casualties, I would routinely report '2 enemy KIA' with no more emotion than I would have written a shopping list. 
Maybe the detachment was a necessity, a form of self-defence. We pilots of fighter planes put up emotional walls to protect ourselves from the reality of the operation. 
But at some point, I thought, the feelings we harboured would come bursting out and those walls would need to come down. 
The constant flip-flop between wartime and peacetime every 12 hours was draining and I was beginning to feel fatigued in a way that was different from the tired feeling you get behind the eyes after a restless night. 
This weariness went much deeper. One day, I told myself, our mission would be finished. The relentless cycle of sorties would be over. 
But not yet. Just 36 hours later I was back in the air over Iraq, my life once again on the line.

23,"Anyone watching Azeem Rafiq’s testimony before the Common’s committee on Tuesday revealing the appalling racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club would — just like him — have been moved to tears.
We heard of repeated taunts of ‘P***’ in the dressing room and the time he learnt his unborn child had died, yet was still expected to train and was berated by one of his coaches for his poor performance.
No compassion, no kindness, just constant racist ‘banter’ that left him feeling suicidal, needing medication for depression and ultimately ended his glittering career.
It was years before Rafiq, 30, found the courage to speak out, to tell of how, aged 15 and a practising Muslim, he was forced to drink wine.
So how sad and confusing for those of us who wept with him to learn now that he had been the perpetrator of racist comments during the very period he suffered such abuse.
In text messages with another Asian cricketer, he wrote of a friend who was tardy in paying for his round of drinks, ‘Hahahaha he is a Jew’ and then ‘only Jews do that kind of s**t’.
Yes, he’s apologised unreservedly for his ignorance but his message shines a spotlight on the casual, endemic racism against the Jewish community that is still alive today.
What is so troubling is that in certain liberal circles it has become almost an acceptable form of racism.
That’s thanks in no small measure to the pro-Palestinian Momentum mob and the failure of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party to eject swiftly all anti-Semites from their midst.
Meanwhile, anti-Semitic abuse on university campuses is up 59 per cent in a year, with Jewish students concerned for their safety.
In his youthful anti-Semitism, Rafiq revealed a horrible truth — that ridiculing Jewish people is placed in a lesser category to ‘real racism’.
Comic David Baddiel wrote about the shocking way many view this two-tier racism in his book Jews Don’t Count, published this year.
If any good can come from Rafiq’s admission and apology it is that there is nothing casual about hurtful tropes directed at any community, whether they be Pakistani or Jewish.
A primary school in Richmond, South-West London, has replaced Winston Churchill’s name at one of its houses with that of free-meal campaigning footballer Marcus Rashford. Jolly progressive but did it occur to teachers that without our wartime leader, their kids would be making Nazi salutes?
Deadly cost of unjabbed
Around 10,000 more people than normal have died in the past four months from non-Covid conditions like heart disease as their treatment was postponed. Why? Because NHS wards are now full of selfish, deluded, unvaccinated patients who caught Covid.
Have these bed-blockers no shame?
They’ve caused unimaginable suffering to the families of those who did the right thing yet were put at the back of the queue for emergency treatment. A plague on all these selfish idiots.
Harry Potter and the ingrates
No one's saying why Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are reuniting to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter film without his creator, J.K. Rowling. Was she cancelled for her views on transgender issues?
Or is it that these ‘stars’ are too stupid to realise she is a true liberal who created the magical world of Hogwarts and the riches they enjoy?
I wish J.K. would cast a spell on these three to make them discover a little gratitude.
Heart-warming pictures of the female Afghan football team landing for a new life in Britain. But how much prouder we would have been had we also seen Afghan translators and their families arrive here, given the hundreds who fought beside British troops but were cruelly left behind.
Meghan Markle has been challenged about saying she was so poor that she used to drive an old Ford Explorer Sport that was so beaten up the door key didn’t work and she had to climb through the boot and over the seats to drive it.

Gaga's gibberish 
Preparing to play Patrizia Reggiani in new movie House Of Gucci, Lady Gaga studied a cat, a fox and a panther to recreate the animalistic guile of the designer’s wife.
Yet she says she sees herself as a whale because they have ‘very big hearts and even if they want to be small, they can’t’.
Crikey, let’s hope she hasn’t had a hand in the film’s dialogue.
Will there be no end to Adele emoting about her divorce and the suffering it caused her and her son Angelo while promoting her new album? The once private singer even included one track My Little Love for Angelo with the lyrics ‘Mummy’s got big feelings. I feel confused. Mama’s got to learn, teach me’. When you ditch half your body weight and your husband to take up with an American sports agent, Mummy, surely it’s your job to teach your child how to cope.
In life, the multi-millionaire novelist Wilbur Smith who has just died aged 88, said his epitaph should be: ‘I did it all. I had it all. Life has been good to me.’ A pity he ensured life wasn’t as good to his three estranged children who he dismissed as getting ‘my sperm, that’s all’.
Westminster wars
A fine and fiery moment when the House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told Boris to sit down and shut up in PMQs. ‘You may run the country,’ he told the PM, ‘but I run this House.’ Never underestimate the tenacity of a man who named his tortoise Maggie.
Irate about the clampdown on second jobs, one self-pitying Tory MP said: ‘The thing no one is mentioning is that we are paid s**t, just 80 grand,’ not mentioning the perks and expenses and gold-plated pensions. Yes, three times the average wage for doing what, it’s becoming clear, is in so many cases a part-time job.
Serena Williams used her profile to highlight the case of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai who ‘disappeared’ after revealing she was forced to have sex with the ex vice-president of President Xi Jinping’s government. Perhaps others like her could also turn the spotlight on a million Uyghur Muslims in ‘re-education camps’ in China where women are raped and sterilised.
Marr the merrier
You know the BBC has lost the plot when they lose a national treasure like Andrew Marr — his departure to pastures greener after 20 years was announced yesterday. I declare an interest as Andrew and the Marr clan have been my friends for more than 20 years.
In her gormless quest for youth and multi-cultural representation, Aunty has forgotten her core mission to act in the entire public’s interest providing services which ‘inform, educate and entertain’, and keeping presenters like Andrew to justify the licence fee.
Sunday mornings will never be the same without The Andrew Marr Show. And if they put politically correct presenters like Amol Rajan in his seat, I’ll stop paying my licence fee.",-2
24,"Jeremy Corbyn faces up to a decade in jail if he ever acts as a cheerleader for Hamas again.
Under measures being announced today, the former Labour leader would be treated as a terrorist if he supports the Palestinian group in future. 
Today’s move will see Home Secretary Priti Patel banning Hamas’s political wing as a terrorist organisation.
Until now it has been treated differently from its military wing, which was outlawed in the UK 20 years ago. 
Successive governments have hesitated over taking similar action against the political wing. But Miss Patel will say that approach will change during a visit to Washington. 
Mr Corbyn described Hamas as ‘friends’ in 2009 and later invited members to Parliament. Afterwards he said he regretted using the term. 
Miss Patel said last night: ‘This should be a very strong message to anyone who thinks it’s OK to support an organisation like Hamas.’ 
Under the measures, being a member of Hamas’ political wing, inviting support for it or arranging a meeting backing it will carry up to ten years in prison. 
Wearing Hamas-badged clothing or displaying its flag will carry up to six months. It is understood the measures will be outlined in the Commons today and are expected to become law within days or weeks. 
In a major speech on security in Washington, Miss Patel is set to say Hamas ‘has long been involved in significant terrorist violence. 
'But the current listing of Hamas creates an artificial distinction between various parts of the organisation. It is right that the listing is updated to reflect this. 
'This is an important step, especially for the Jewish community. Hamas is fundamentally and rabidly anti-Semitic. 
'Anti-Semitism is an enduring evil which I will never tolerate.’
Miss Patel urged Labour to support the Hamas measures in Parliament. 
Marie van der Zyl, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ‘The proscription ends the dangerous loophole via which this terrorist organisation can spread its extremist poison here and raise funds and support in the UK.
‘Hamas regularly espouses violent jihad and grotesque anti-Semitism.’ 
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, said: ‘He has never been a supporter of Hamas but recognises the need to bring all sides together for dialogue to promote security, peace and justice.’
In 2010 Mr Corbyn held talks with senior Hamas officials in Jerusalem, but it was claimed he did not meet a single Jewish Israeli. 
Labour later defended the trip, saying he was ‘engaging with actors in the conflict to support peace and justice in the Middle East. That is the right thing to do.’",-2
25,"More than £115million of taxpayers' cash was 'wasted' buying hundreds of homes along the section of the HS2 route that was scrapped this week.
A total of 455 properties were bought on the high-speed rail line's original 'eastern leg', which was supposed to link Birmingham with Leeds.
But the Government announced on Thursday that this section will now only go to East Midlands Parkway, south-west of Nottingham. This means around two-thirds of the eastern leg has been axed – and it is understood most of the 455 properties were located along this section.
The homes were bought so they could be knocked down for the train line, but this will no longer be necessary. However, the properties cannot be sold off as ministers have reserved the right to revive the original route – with no cut-off date.
The homes were bought by HS2 Ltd, the company set up to deliver the high-speed rail project, on behalf of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. In total £115,013,357 was spent, or an average of around £250,000 per property. Owners decided to sell after being told that their homes were along HS2's eastern leg route. Many are understood to be near Toton in Nottinghamshire, where a new hub was to be built, and between Sheffield and Leeds. Some are now being rented.
Tory MP Greg Smith, who sits on the Commons transport committee, said: 'It's horrendous. I think there was a genuine change of heart from the Government about the eastern leg. But it's disgraceful that people have been made to feel that they have to move out... before a project is 100 per cent signed off.'
Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem transport spokesman, said: 'It's a waste of money. This shows the consequences of the Government's indecision. It has disrupted people's lives who made plans – either to move home or make business investments – based on the promise the Government repeatedly made to deliver HS2.'
Thousands more homeowners along the original route have also been left in limbo for years by the Government's revamped strategy, known as the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP). This is because ministers have decided the 'safeguarding directions' that protect the route are to remain in place.
This means homeowners are in effect still on notice that the Government could decide to proceed with the original HS2 route up to Leeds, and so their properties may still need to be destroyed. Ministers have not set a cut-off date for a decision.
It also means that under the law HS2 Ltd will be obliged to buy properties that homeowners want to sell, despite the fact that the line may never be built in full.
Harry Fone, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Ministers should scrap the rest of HS2 before the bill spirals even further out of control.' The Department for Transport said: 'We recognise the impact HS2 has had on residents.
'That's why our compensation schemes go far beyond what the law requires. The Government has now committed to explore the most effective way to run HS2 trains to Leeds and it's important we safeguard properties until final decisions are taken.'
Our housing estate's gone off the rails
BY CHRIS BROOKE FOR THE DAILY MAIL 
For residents of a £30million housing estate, the on-off HS2 project has been a blight on their lives.
Even now, the legal possibility that the rail line could be revived in future has left the community in limbo.
What families thought of as 'forever homes' became worthless overnight when it was announced five years ago that the revised route would go through the Shimmer estate in Mexborough, South Yorkshire.
Years of stress followed as more than 160 homeowners from the estate – which was then still under construction – tried to negotiate a fair deal from HS2 Ltd to buy their properties.
Several described the company's behaviour as 'horrendous' and at least one suffered a breakdown as a result.
The announcement this week that the eastern leg of HS2 was being scrapped means their suffering has been for nothing.
But even now communities along the route are unable to move on, as 'safeguarding' remains in place – meaning the potential for the line being revived remains. Thanks to the spectre of HS2, the once-prized townhouses, surrounded by picturesque countryside, are being rented out at low cost. Crime and anti-social behaviour has flourished, and just two of the original owners remain.
In July 2016, when the HS2 route was revealed, 166 houses of up to four bedrooms had been sold and occupied, with another 46 under construction or due to be built soon. About 400 people lived there.
Robert Hulme, 38, said HS2 was a factor in the break-up with his then-partner, who had lived with him on the estate for three years.
HS2 originally offered to buy his house for £149,000, the same price he had bought it for, but after almost three years of wrangling he accepted £163,000. By then his relationship was over.
'It caused a lot of arguments between us and we ended up splitting up. It caused a lot of stress,' he said.
'We had to go through a lot of bartering to get the price up bit by bit, but then we split up and had no choice but to accept. From start to finish it was horrendous.
'It was heartbreaking. When we moved in we were delighted. It had a balcony, the neighbours were very nice and it was a nice estate.
'There is a Facebook group and now they have problems with burglaries and kids throwing stones... they have moved social housing in now.'
Mr Hulme, an alarm installer, said he was now with a new partner and had 'moved on', but the U-turn to scrap the line was 'annoying' as it 'caused a lot of stress'.
Carer Leigh Smith, 56, and her teacher husband Michael were also forced to sell up – but moving out took three years.
Having initially been offered £12,000 less than the £140,000 they paid for the property, they eventually received a sum more or less matching it. However, they still made a loss given the cost of moving to a new home in Doncaster. 'Our mortgage is now £50,000 more and the property is smaller,' Mrs Smith said.
She added that the couple became 'ill' as a result of trying to move, which saw them continually reserving homes elsewhere only to lose out due to delays by HS2 Ltd in sorting out the Shimmer estate sale. 'They were awful,' she said. 'It has been horrendous and I nearly had a breakdown.' The couples' suffering was made worse as the original property was 'our dream come true, our forever home'.
'We had only been there three weeks when the letter about the train line arrived,' she said. 'We hadn't even done a meter reading.'
Another householder is still on medication from a breakdown resulting from their ordeal. Bev Chapman, a local councillor who has dealt with many of the residents, said: 'People have literally had the rug pulled away from underneath them, it was awful.'
An HS2 spokesman said safeguarding of the route remains as a review is under way to look at how to bring high-speed services through South Yorkshire to Leeds.",-2
26,"Despite his current travails, no one can take away from Prince Andrew his heroic role as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands war.
And I hear the Queen’s second son plans to use his military career as a way to return to public life.
Next year is the 40th anniversary of the conflict in the South Atlantic, which claimed 255 British military lives, and the Duke of York will attend commemorative events in the summer.
‘The Duke is determined to take part in the Falklands commemorations,’ a source tells me. ‘The Falklands was a key moment in his life and he wants to honour his fallen comrades. He hopes this could help pave the way for a return to public life.’
Today is the second anniversary of Andrew’s withdrawal from royal duties, after the overwhelmingly negative reaction to his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis about his ill-advised friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke on three occasions when she was 17.
However, earlier this month, a U.S. judge set a date in January for Andrew’s bid to have his accuser’s allegations thrown out.
He has repeatedly and vehemently denied the claims.
My source tells me: ‘The Duke expects that the court action in New York will have been dealt with long before the Falklands events.’
A spokesman for one of the organisations Andrew is still involved with, the Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel Trust, tells me he will be welcome to attend. ‘We have a big commemorative service on June 12. It’s all about those who were lost, the veterans no matter who they were, those who were lucky enough to come home.’
A royal source is keen to make clear that Andrew would be attending events as a veteran, saying: ‘No invitation has been received for the Duke to attend events in an official capacity.’ Andrew’s spokesman declines to comment.
Has Kate given her catwalk career the boot?
She's had one of the most successful careers in fashion, spanning three decades, but could Kate Moss finally be strutting away from the runway for good?
I ask because this week, the 47- year-old supermodel closed down the long-standing business through which she’s channelled her catwalk earnings, Skate.
Newly filed documents reveal that the company, which she set up in 2008, has officially ceased trading.
At one point it had about £5million in assets. Her spokesman declines to comment but friends say she’s now focusing on the business she established in 2016 to manage the careers of fellow mannequins, the Kate Moss Agency.
‘I want people who can sing, dance and act,’ she explained at the time of the launch. ‘I want to create stars.’
The move comes after a removals lorry was spotted for two days in a row outside Moss’s house in North London, suggesting the reformed hedonist was quitting city life.
Moss also has a cottage in the Cotswolds, where she spent most of her time during the pandemic with daughter Lila, 19, and boyfriend Count Nikolai von Bismarck, 34. 
As the new boss of the landed gentry’s union, Mark Tufnell should be accustomed to sitting astride a horse as he hunts.
In a startling confession, Tufnell, who owns an estate in the Cotswolds, has, however, admitted he’s scared of all things equine.
And his fear prevented his becoming a vet.
‘I found I was terrified of horses — couldn’t go near them,’ the new president of the Country Landowners’ Association admits.
Let’s hope his members don’t gallop away...
Chelsea chocolate war set to end in sweet revenge for Chantal... 
Who knew that chocolate could leave such a bitter taste? Word reaches me of an unseemly feud in the genteel world of expensive treats.
At next week’s Chelsea Physic Garden Christmas fair, one stall will be manned by Chantal Coady, co-chair of the Academy of Chocolate, who will be officially launching her company, The Chocolate Detective.
Just across the lawn, West London’s well-heeled shoppers will find Rococo, the firm Coady founded and spent 37 years turning into a luxury brand adored by the Queen and Hollywood stars.
However, this stall will be operated by Rupert Morley, a Comic Relief trustee, now its sole owner.
Coady abruptly departed the company she loved so dearly in 2019. Morley invested in the company in 2017 when Rococo had five shops and had been valued at £10million.
To Coady’s dismay, she was gradually edged out of the business until it suddenly went into administration in 2019. Morley snapped up Rococo weeks later.
‘Losing Rococo has been utter hell for Chantal,’ a friend tells me. ‘She was wiped out financially and emotionally.
'It has been desperately sad, but she is fighting back and starting from scratch again.’
Morley declines to comment, but I hope this war can have a sweet ending.",-2
27,"ABBA’s new album Voyage has made history with its UK chart success.
The Waterloo hitmakers released their first album in 40 years earlier this month, and it soared to the top of the Official Albums Chart during its first week of release. 
The album marked ABBA’s 10th number one album in the UK, and it became 2021's fastest-selling album so far as it registered the biggest first week sales in four years.
But new data has also unveiled the album managed to top the album charts in 17 different countries, as it achieved worldwide sales in excess of 1 million copies in its first week, and has received more than 190 million combined streams to date. 
Speaking on the early success of Voyage, the band said: 'We are so happy that our fans seem to have enjoyed our new album as much as we enjoyed making it! 
'We are absolutely over the moon to have an album at the top of the charts again.'   
The news comes as the Mamma Mia singers also achieved new heights with their greatest hits album, GOLD, which reached a landmark BRIT Certified 20x Platinum in the UK this week. 
ABBA's GOLD was released in September 1992, debuting at Number 1, and has gone on to be the UK's second best-selling album of all time, falling only behind Queen’s greatest hits album. 
About the certification BPI's Rob Crutchley, who oversees The BRIT Certified Awards, said: 'Gold going 20x Platinum is an extraordinary achievement. 
'It shows – along with the great success of Voyage – just how well-loved Abba are and how their enduring appeal truly spans generations.'
Earlier this week ABBA announced details of their first ever Christmas single Little Things which will be released on CD through Universal Music Group on December 3.
The single appears on Voyage, and is a gentle reflection on the joy of Christmas morning and family time around this special time of year.",-2
28,"Ashes hero Matthew Hoggard was blocked from speaking at an awards dinner on Friday night as a direct consequence of using racist language to Azeem Rafiq.
It came on a day ECB chief executive Tom Harrison vowed to stay on to clean up cricket. Harrison, speaking following an emergency meeting of all stakeholders at the Oval, insisted that he is the man to make the sport more diverse and to drive real change, a determination reported by Sportsmail on Friday.
Harrison claimed he received the support of the 41 ECB members to address the racism crisis, which will begin with the publication of a 12-point action plan next week, though he is still expected to leave Lord’s next year once a new chair has been appointed.
‘I’m determined to lead this change through cricket,’ Harrison said. 
‘I feel passionately about this issue. It’s something I feel to my core. I’ve been trying to drive an inclusive and diverse sport from the moment I arrived as chief executive in 2015. I feel very motivated and very supported to make sure that change happens.’
Meanwhile Hoggard, 44, had been booked to appear at the ECB-accredited North East Premier League’s presentation evening, but following Rafiq’s revelations at the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Tuesday that the paceman had nicknamed him ‘Raffa the Kaffir’ — for which the ex-pace bowler has since apologised — Ryan Sidebottom was drafted in to replace him.
NEPL secretary Gordon Halliday confirmed to Sportsmail: ‘Our committee didn’t feel it would be appropriate for Matthew to speak at our presentation evening. It is attended by people of mixed ages, mixed sexes and mixed races.
‘The committee felt it was in the best interests of Matthew and of those attending that we found a replacement speaker.’
Hoggard has been popular on the after-dinner circuit since he retired in 2013 and is on the books of Champions Celebrity Talent Agency.
The cancellation comes after the BBC pulled Hoggard’s 2005 Ashes-winning skipper Michael Vaughan from his recent radio show in the wake of other Rafiq revelations.",-2
29,"By the time you get to the end of this column it is possible that I will have been nicked by the boys in blue. I have been sent a 'warning notice'.
My crime was to buy a car 27 years ago and keep it. I boasted that I was doing the right thing by the environment. 
Replacing a medium-sized car like mine with a new one generates a carbon footprint of 17 tonnes —the equivalent of three years' worth of gas and electricity in a typical UK home.
Since the average motorist changes their car five or six times in 27 years, I've practically saved the planet from global warming single-handedly.
It's not that I expected a knighthood. I just didn't expect to be punished for it. 
But Transport for London has changed emission rules so we OACs (Owners of Ancient Cars) who live within the North and South Circular roads must now fork out £12.50 every time we drive anywhere. All day and every day (except Christmas).
That meant setting up an account to pay the charges. So I did as I was told and got an email confirming that my account was active. 
Off I drove. A few days later, the Warning Notice arrived.
I was puzzled, so I checked the website and got nowhere. The password I'd used for the account was suddenly not accepted. 
So I phoned the number on the website. And got nowhere. This time the problem seemed to be my PIN. 
Or maybe my account number. Or maybe my customer ID. Or my PCN number. Whatever that was. The recorded message didn't really care. I gave up.
I had become the innocent victim of the new digital age in which the algorithm reigns supreme.
There was a time when a human being with a problem talked to another human being who helped to get it sorted. Those days are gone. 
The lives of big companies and government officials are made so much easier if we customers or clients can be kept at arm's length. 
It began long before the pandemic struck. Covid has given it a rocket booster.
It's so much easier to cite Covid if you're dealing with a customer who wants to complain about the heating engineer not turning up.
Easier for them, that is. Not for you. 
You just have to keep listening to the recorded message telling you that your call is important to them, but unfortunately they are receiving a very large volume of calls and, due to Covid restrictions, there will regrettably be some delay in getting to you.
What a load of rubbish. Even if it were true that 'Covid restrictions' still existed and call handlers were forced to work from home, modern technology means calls could very easily be patched through to them. 
But it's not true. Not any longer. Five minutes in the rush hour on any Tube or bus proves that if you want to go to work, you can.
But that's assuming your company actually wants you to go to work. 
The statistics show that many firms are saving loads of money by encouraging office staff to sit at computers in their own homes rather than occupy expensive space in their city centre office block.
At least with private companies we customers retain the merest smidgeon of power. We can always take our custom elsewhere.
It worked for me, sort of, when my home alarm system kept going wrong and my long-suffering neighbour was being woken up in the middle of the night by it.
I spent endless hours on the phone listening to their recorded messages warning me, amongst many other things, that an engineer couldn't visit unless there was somewhere for him to wash his hands and wondering how many homes don't have washbasins.
Eventually, I cracked and told them I was switching companies. Result. The engineer came. Not on the day promised, but let's be thankful for small mercies.
That option does not exist, however, if it's a government department you are forced to deal with. Especially if it's the dreaded HMRC.
You'd have needed a heart of stone not to share the pain Ben Wilkinson described in this paper a few days ago. 
It took him one hour and 44 minutes of being forced to listen to the hideous music and even more hideous recorded messages telling him the delays were 'due to coronavirus' before he was able to speak to an actual person.
And then the human told him she could not help him because she had 'not been trained' to deal with his particular problem. 
So he had to start all over again. The really scary part of this is that Ben is not alone. 
And it's not as if HMRC can claim that they are getting an abnormally high number of calls.
Their own annual report, published this month, shows they received 33 million calls in the past financial year. 
That's 8 million fewer than the year before. Four years ago, only 15 per cent of callers had to wait more than ten minutes. That figure has more than trebled.
This is more than just an inconvenience. The taxman has enormous powers. Quite right, too. 
Nobody enjoys paying tax and even the most diligent citizen might make the occasional mistake. 
Plus there are many fraudsters out there — sometimes aided and abetted by dubious accountants — who should be in jail rather than their Caribbean tax haven.
But there are also many entirely innocent people being threatened with fines and visits from debt-collection agencies over money they do not owe.
And on the other side of the balance sheet are those who are forced to wait months for refunds of money they should never have been made to pay in the first place.
Ironically, the HMRC website offers a service called 'Where's my reply?' I say 'ironically' because I've just checked it out. 
I logged onto the website and claimed (a modest white lie) that I'd made a query about my self-assessment a few days ago.
It told me I could expect a reply by June 2. That's six months. Oh … and if I still hadn't had a reply I could try phoning. To which there is only one response: a hollow laugh.
It's a bit like your doctor telling you not to worry about his rather bleak diagnosis because you'll probably be dead soon anyway.
I suppose we should applaud HMRC for admitting that it's not exactly covering itself in glory. 
Or, to use its own language, 'not fulfilling the ambition to be a trusted, modern tax and customs department'.
Perhaps it would help if their customer-service staff were not working from their offices only one day a week.
I suspect there's something else going on here. Covid is a convenient excuse for forcing us to abandon any hope we might have had of talking to a living, breathing human being who might actually help us with our problem.
The Institute of Customer Service says that for the first time more than half of all our interactions with companies or public services are being made digitally.
Incidentally, you might like to know that I have just learned that 'they' won't be coming to take me away after all.
I have managed to make contact with a real human being at Transport for London who was both courteous and competent. 
It helped, of course, that I have the advantage of a public platform in the shape of this newspaper. Most do not.
Increasingly, we are being deprived of even a semblance of what we once thought of as customer service.
We are left talking to a computer screen behind which sits not another human being, but an algorithm. Or a recorded telephone announcement that may or may not respond to our pleas for help.
It's as though any human compassion in the relationship between customer and provider has simply disappeared. And that's very sad.",-2
30,"Early in 2019, a few months after he resigned as Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson and I had lunch in a family-run Italian restaurant close to the old Spectator offices in Bloomsbury.
I arrived a bit early and was shown to a table perhaps 20 paces from the door. Ten minutes later Boris bounced into view, slightly flushed from his cycle ride but exuberant as ever.
That extraordinary star quality was immediately apparent. At almost every table between us, diners stood wanting to shake his hand, slap him on the back or pose for selfies — all of which he happily played along with.
Despite the short distance between us, it took him a good five minutes to cover it. The whole place, previously rather quiet, was buzzing with excitement.
When we ordered, he asked whether the sea bass was fresh or had been frozen. The waiter was momentarily nonplussed.
A minute later, the owner came over. He said the fish on the menu had indeed been frozen, but added that he had bought two fresh bass that morning, for himself and his wife.
‘One of them, I will cook for you myself,’ he said. Boris worried slightly about what the poor man’s wife was going to eat but managed to overcome his reservations. ‘Superb!’ he said.
Over the next couple of hours, we covered a lot of ground; his exasperation with the hung Parliament, Theresa May’s weakness, the Brexit quagmire.
He hadn’t yet launched his leadership bid, but Mrs May was obviously in his sights and he was anticipating going into the next election as leader.
It was equally clear that to win a decent Commons majority, Boris would have to persuade millions of traditional Labour voters that he was their man.
The Brexit rift meant most of inner-London was dead to him but the Eurosceptic constituencies behind the northern Red Wall offered huge potential.
These places had voted Labour by reflex — for generations in some cases — but with Jeremy Corbyn and a largely metropolitan clique now in charge, the dial was shifting.
They saw the Corbynistas as ‘loony Left’ obsessed with issues of identity, unpatriotic and out of touch with the everyday concerns of ordinary families.
However, the question was, could they bring themselves to vote Tory, the party their parents and grandparents had dismissed, in Nye Bevan’s notorious words, as ‘lower than vermin’.
Of course, we now know the answer. I can’t remember whether Boris was already talking about ‘levelling up’ but there was no doubting his enthusiasm for what he saw as his one- nation mission.
Or, I believe, his sincerity. That lunch came back to me this week, as a series of blunders, U-turns and policy shifts saw the Prime Minister’s credibility seriously undermined — especially it seems among Red Wall supporters.
The torrent of sleaze allegations which followed the Owen Paterson debacle, the second jobs farrago, an apparently unstoppable flood of cross-Channel migrants and now the axing of the promised high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds, as well as the eastern leg of HS2 all enraged his new MPs in the North.
There is much talk of a party schism between older MPs of the Tory shires and the mainly younger 2019 Red Wall intake, especially over second jobs.
While many of the former have become used to supplementing their MPs’ pay with outside earnings, the latter mostly believe taking their Commons salary means they should devote all their time to the job in hand.
Other divisions are also opening up, especially over economic and fiscal policy.
The new intake are generally more tolerant of higher spending, even if that means higher taxes. This is, of course, anathema to traditional Conservatives.
So the legacy of the 2019 landslide is a Parliamentary party which, while strong in numbers, is dangerously divided in outlook and purpose.
Unless Boris can square this circle his prospects in 2024 could be grim.
Sir Keir Starmer may be dull, uninspiring and another member of the North London gang. But he is not Jeremy Corbyn — and that is a huge asset.
If the Tories descend into internecine warfare, it is by no means impossible that the Labour leader could win and form a government.
So yes, the PM must carry through his promise of uniting and levelling up the country.
But he must also do the same for his party. In the interests of full disclosure, I should say that I have known and liked Boris Johnson for nearly 30 years, from the time we both worked on The Daily Telegraph.
I don’t claim any special relationship, but we played a bit of tennis and cricket as well as working together back in those days and our paths have crossed a few times since.
God knows, he has his flaws. Rackety doesn’t begin to describe aspects of his private life. He has a habit of thinking everything can be distilled into a joke, and he occasionally speaks before fully engaging his brain.
But he has the alchemic ability to make people forgive his foibles, through his great charm, wit and intelligence.
Voters have factored in his faults and have taken to him, warts and all. Up to now.
There are those who will never forgive him for Brexit and want to see him destroyed. Just listen to the BBC if you need proof.
But for all the noise they make, the Boris-haters are not in the majority.
They caricature him as a buffoon. They are wrong.
Although he projects a blustering, Woosterish persona, those who dismiss him as a fool make a serious misjudgment. However, he is no longer a journalist, whose column is written one week and generally forgotten by the next.
He is in charge now and has to behave accordingly.
I am also, by the way, a Red Waller — by breeding at least. Who knew we would ever become so fashionable? Born and brought up in a working class Middlesbrough family, I had no real concept of any other class until I left home.
My father served his time at Dorman Long steelworks, where the Sydney Harbour Bridge and countless other great structures of Empire were built.
After the war (he joined the Fleet Air Arm soon after his 18th birthday in 1943), he worked at Smith’s Dock and latterly in the vast petrochemical plant at ICI Wilton.
He was briefly an official in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and voted Labour as a matter of faith. But like many working class northerners, he was socially conservative.
He worked hard to buy his own house, was aspirational for his children and had a strong sense of pride in being British.
It is this innate conservatism that Boris Johnson tapped into with such success in 2019.
The industrial North is not a single entity, of course.
But there are strong uniting factors, the main one being decades of relative neglect.
The strikes and industrial decline of the 1970s were followed by the inevitable but deeply scarring Thatcher reforms and a chronic lack of subsequent investment.
Northern Tory MPs are looking to Boris for change and are understandably dismayed that he stands accused once more of over-promising and under-delivering.
Labour’s taunt that his levelling up agenda has fallen at the first hurdle resonates with their constituents.
However, they must also recognise some of the things he has achieved. In tandem with the impressive Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen, he has brought new industry, employment and hope to a once deprived area.
Some Whitehall functions are being moved north, notably the new economic campus in Darlington, where hundreds of Treasury officials will work.
There has already been considerable expansion of green jobs in the North, with more to follow. New money has also been found to revivify struggling High Streets. 
And although the HS2 project has been scaled down, some £96billion will still be spent on the new Integrated Rail Plan, overhauling Inter-City links across the North and Midlands. This is a colossal amount of money and should not be sneered at.
Red Wall members should also remember they owe their positions in Parliament almost entirely to the PM, without whom most couldn’t have hoped to be elected.
They are now Tory MPs and must work with him to achieve their aims, not against him. For his part, Boris has to do better. The recent pain inflicted on the party was entirely avoidable.
The Owen Paterson affair, which began it all, should never have happened.
Mr Paterson broke the rules by engaging in paid lobbying while an MP and a 30-day Commons suspension was recommended after an investigation by the standards commissioner.
If he had served his penance quietly, the whole thing would have been quickly forgotten.
Instead, the PM sprang to his defence (probably without reading the report into his misdemeanours) and whipped the party to support him.
He also tried to destabilise the standards commissioner who ruled against him.
However well intentioned, this was a wretched decision which backfired spectacularly and caused his party no end of damage — all self-inflicted.
Another confession. I was present at, and had a supporting role in organising, the now infamous Garrick Club dinner for old Daily Telegraph hacks, at which the plot to save Mr Paterson was allegedly sealed.
Boris was there, but if he was hatching a conspiracy of any kind, he hid it exceptionally well.
There were 32 people present and he spent most of the time bounding around the tables reacquainting himself with old colleagues, pausing only briefly to make an entertaining but uncontroversial speech.
To clear up a number of other misrepresentations, it has been widely described as an all-male affair. It wasn’t. There were a number (admittedly small) of women there, one of whom gave a brilliant address.
Former Telegraph editor and public Paterson apologist Charles Moore is said to have hosted it. He didn’t.
Most shockingly, Boris is said to have made cruel and disparaging remarks about his wife Carrie, which many allegedly heard and were ‘astonished’ by.
I was sitting six feet away from him and it’s news to me, as it was to several other attendees I have asked about it.
I understand the source of the story claims the remarks were heard by 30 people, suggesting it must have been said during his speech.
This being the age of the iPhone, the speech was recorded by one of the diners as a memento. Carrie isn’t even mentioned.
The evening has been characterised by some media outlets as some unreconstructed, port-swilling, Stilton-guzzling, boys’ club extravaganza.
In fact, it was simply a reunion of old friends.
The menu was chosen largely for its cheapness, and the wine was the Garrick equivalent of house red. No caviar, no cote de boeuf, no Stilton — or indeed any other cheese.
It’s unfortunate that, because Boris was always an outsider, now he’s PM he has few political allies or counsellors in Westminster.
He initially staffed No. 10 with people from his time as London mayor and in the Vote Leave campaign.
Most have gone, leaving him perilously short of hands to retrieve the ball when he drops it — or, ideally, before.
The row over who paid for the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat is a prime example of Boris’s sometimes stunning lack of attention to detail.
Detail matters. Probity and financial integrity matter. And so does keeping your promises.
The PM has a long-standing love of grand projects — even if the chance of them ever coming to fruition is negligible.
An island airport in the Thames estuary, a tunnel from Stranraer in western Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland, even a roundabout under the Isle of Man.
Imaginative projects, but all hopelessly quixotic.
Two years ago, Boris acknowledged that the Red Wall constituencies had merely ‘lent’ him their votes.
If he wants to make that arrangement more permanent, he must earn their continued trust.
He is certainly capable of doing it, but it will take hard work and sharp focus.
Of course he needs vision, but levelling up is not just about flights of fancy or high-blown rhetoric.
It requires targeted, sometimes incremental improvements to connectivity, economic prospects, training, education and quality of life.
Illegal immigration, too, must be tackled as a matter of extreme urgency.
Taking back control of our borders was a key issue during the referendum debate — particularly in the North.
For all the recent setbacks, the PM still has political capital in the bank.
He has delivered Brexit, won a landslide and presided over the vaccine miracle which is slowly beating the worst health crisis we have seen in a century.
And let’s not forget, he routed Corbynism.
The Tories may have made some bad decisions during the pandemic, but just imagine if Mr Corbyn, John McDonnell and Diane Abbott had been in charge!
Worryingly though, there is a dangerous sense of drift around the Government right now and Labour is making hay without really having to try.
Boris is a remarkable politician and a proven winner.
And for all the hysteria, he is by no means holed below the water line.
But to use his own words, he needs to prenez un grip, if he is to stop those borrowed Red Wall votes being repossessed.
The words of former New York governor Mario Cuomo come to mind. ‘Campaign in poetry, govern in prose.’",-2
31,"Publishing tycoon Dominic De Sousa craved fame as a singer but only found it when he died performing at a BBC event.
Now his name is at the centre of an astonishing inheritance battle as his sister claims a fake Russian bride is using a forged wedding certificate to pose as his widow.
Mr De Sousa was 56 when he died on stage singing Hey Jude at a BBC Good Food Awards ceremony in Dubai in December 2015, as Great British Bake Off presenter Paul Hollywood watched.
The incident so shocked TV celebrity chef James Martin, who had chatted to Mr De Sousa moments before his death, that he quit his Saturday Kitchen show as he re-evaluated his life.
The latest twist is that a tiger-wrestling Russian, Svetlana Brezhneva, 58, who lives in Dubai, has applied to the High Court in London claiming to be his widow.
She says in documents filed in court that Mr De Sousa’s UK assets, worth £640,000, were wrongly given to his sister Maria De Sousa – and that they should instead be paid to her.
Miss De Sousa has hit back in legal documents, denying there was a marriage and claiming that a wedding certificate from Kislovodsk in Russia in 2014 is forged.
Born in Kenya, Mr De Sousa moved to London as a child, went to school with snooker star Jimmy White and played guitar in a cruise ship band called Black Velvet.
A British citizen, he lived in Merton, south London, but then made his fortune in magazines in Dubai.
Performing as a singer, however, remained his first love and he continued to do so at public events and on the internet.
In the 1990s, as is accepted by his sister, he met Miss Brezhneva, who rescued big cats abandoned from the zoos of United Emirates royals and ran a small refuge for lions and tigers with which she would tussle playfully.
The Russian now claims she was by Mr De Sousa’s side for much of his life after they met in 1994, that they married in 2014 and that she is due his entire estate.
Her case is rejected in documents filed by lawyers for Miss De Sousa, of Wimbledon, south London, who argue Miss Brezhneva ‘is not entitled to any part of the deceased’s estate’.
Miss De Sousa’s lawyer Arabella Adams said: ‘Miss Brezhneva and Mr De Sousa were never married and the alleged marriage certificate is a forgery.’
She also alleges that in 2016 Miss Brezhneva went to the Dubai courts with a handwritten will she claimed was Mr De Sousa’s final testament. She said that not only was her claim for his money rejected by the court but ‘at no point did she ever mention being the deceased’s wife’.
It is claimed Miss Brezhneva only mentioned the marriage for the first time in June 2019 in a fresh case in Dubai demanding his money. That case has twice been rejected and she is on a final appeal to the Dubai supreme court.
Miss De Sousa’s lawyers say the handwritten will is invalid because all three of the named witnesses to it said they signed after Mr De Sousa’s death. Miss Brezhneva insists the 2006 will should be adhered to regardless.
Miss De Sousa’s lawyers argue her brother died intestate, or without a will, and as next of kin she was his sole heir under British law.
Miss Brezhneva says in her claim that as Mr De Sousa’s ‘surviving spouse’ she ‘is entitled to the whole of his estate’.
She notes that in 2018 Miss De Sousa, who describes herself as chief executive and owner of her brother’s Dubai firm CPI Media, was given all he owned in Britain.
But the Russian’s UK lawyer Laura Webster claims the sister ‘is not entitled to any share of the deceased’s estate’.
Miss Brezhneva, who works as a photographer, said last night the marriage was ‘unforgettable’ because it took place in 2014 on April 12 – which is celebrated in Russia as Cosmonautics Day.
She added: ‘Dominic and I met here in Dubai – we both came with only suitcases and launched this business [the publishing firm]. Maria got everything.’
Miss De Sousa did not respond to requests for comment.",-2
32,"She is one of Britain's most brilliant actresses who is still, aged 88, winning rave reviews for her latest West End role. 
Now, in the first extract from our exclusive serialisation of her reissued and updated memoirs, Dame Sian Phillips reveals how she fell helplessly in love with the charismatic Peter O'Toole — and how their marriage began to be corroded by his drinking and obsessive sexual jealousy . . .
One night, in the early hours, I was woken by a noise coming from the ground-floor window of my front room in Notting Hill. I got out of bed without putting on the light.
Improbably, there was a face pressed to the glass and a tall ﬁgure perilously straddling the gap between the window and the steps to the front door.
I raised the sash slowly and two hands plunged in to seize the window frame. Then, with a heave, two long, slim feet swung down to the ﬂoor, and over 6ft of Peter O'Toole sketched a little bow.
I wanted to applaud. At the same time, I was astonished: we'd become close friends after acting together in a play, but had fallen out spectacularly.
I had innocently repeated to a friend something he'd told me about a former girlfriend — and when O'Toole found out, he had reacted with such fury that I never expected to see him again.
'I've got a car,' he said now. 'Coming for a cup of tea?'
'It's three in the morning.'
'So?'
'I'm in my nightie.'
'Put a mac on.'
That was the start, in 1958. We were in our early 20s and had no trouble adjusting our living habits to suit each other.
I'd never stayed up late, but came to love it. And he began to enjoy seeing the world in daylight hours — streets and parks as well as the dark interiors of bars.
The only slight difficulty was drink. Before meeting O'Toole, I'd never tasted beer, let alone whisky. I realised quickly that an appreciation of draught Guinness was essential in my new life and persevered, sipping the hated drink slowly during evenings when O'Toole drank his own age in the stuff.
Everyone we knew drank so much; incredible quantities of alcohol were lowered on every conceivable social occasion. Coming from a nonconformist, teetotal Welsh background, I was cautiously intrigued by the guilt-free, amusing nature of drinking to excess.
It was easy living together — and with wonderful sex thrown into the mix, it was ecstatic. While I played lead after lead in live television plays, O'Toole was in Willis Hall's The Long And The Short And The Tall, his ﬁrst big London success.
After the play, the company would move to the bar next door. When the pub shut, there would be a muttered conference and a large part of the crowd would drift off to parties in basement ﬂats, then hit the after-hours clubs.
The fag-end of the night was my favourite part. The two of us would walk to the all-night tea-and-sandwich stand in Covent Garden and order huge mugs of tea and hot-sausage sandwiches, which we ate sitting opposite Lloyds Bank.
Fortiﬁed, O'Toole would say, 'OK. Now for a little climb,' and he'd scale the wall of Lloyds.
The ﬁrst time he did this, I was terriﬁed and tried to dissuade him. But in a remarkably short space of time, I came to accept his dangerous behaviour as fairly unremarkable and would sit on the low wall with the tramps, nursing my tea, watching him.
He was sure-footed. And lucky. The regulars knew him as 'Pete' and gave him a little cheer as he ﬁnished the descent.
In our bedroom one day, O'Toole looked at my wardrobe of good clothes and said, 'You look as though you're in mourning for your sex life — all this black and violet. Give it here.'
It was late at night and raining as he gathered up armfuls of organza and wool, bags, shoes, gloves, frocks, hats and suits and, opening the window, ﬂung thousands of pounds' worth of clothes on to the wet cobbles below.
I had a momentary pang of regret. 'But what will I wear?' I asked.
'My clothes,' he said grandly, gathering me into his arms.
So we became the only couple in London who shared a wardrobe. Winter and summer, we wore cotton trousers, canvas shoes, lumberjack shirts and big knitted ﬁsherman sweaters. I had to roll his trousers up, of course, which made me look like a waif (he looked like a handsome pirate).
O'Toole's friends didn't approve of me. They felt his free spirit was being sucked into a conventional relationship and, with no special ill-will towards me, tried to put a stop to it.
I didn't mind. They weren't to know we had a new kind of equal partnership and that the last thing I had in mind was domesticity — as alien to me as it was to him.
My friends, advisers and employers were equally appalled and bluntly said that he would destroy my career, trample all over me.
They must be mad, I thought. I was deliriously in love. What could possibly go wrong?
During a break in Ireland in 1959, O'Toole suddenly clutched me and said, 'Have my children.' I instantly said, 'Yes.'
Five weeks later, it dawned on me that I must be pregnant. It turned out there was a conventional side to O'Toole after all: although he never proposed, he kept saying, 'We must arrange this marriage.'
Our wedding in Dublin was essentially an excuse for a p***-up. From pub to pub, we criss-crossed the city that night, gathering well-wishers. By 3am there were just ﬁve of us left, standing in a shebeen.
Was it marriage that changed him? Back in London, he would come grumpily home at night and sometimes go straight out again. Without me. Some nights, he didn't come home at all.
I knew what he was doing: he was leading the life we used to lead together, but now I was the wife and not really eligible. Nor, I realised, was he keen on me working, or at least not in leading roles.
I said nothing. All I'd ever wanted was to act — but the idea of a wife with a career, demanding rights, was laughable back then.
Then came an offer for O'Toole to play Shylock in The Merchant Of Venice in Peter Hall's new company. So in January 1960, as I neared the end of my pregnancy, we moved to Stratford-upon-Avon. We'd rented a big Edwardian house called Mount Pleasant (promptly re-christened 'Mount Unpleasant' by O'Toole).
Heavy now — and resenting it — I was surprised to ﬁnd that my free spirit, my equal partner, expected me to clean the house, wash, iron, provide meals and be on parade when needed.
Drink now became a dominant factor in our marriage. I made meals at night and threw them away uneaten before I went alone to bed. Often I'd wake to ﬁnd O'Toole asleep in an armchair, by an overturned glass.
In 1960, clever women shrugged tolerantly in the face of masculine stupidity. They knew if they complained, they would be branded as 'strident'. And when women did stamp and scream, they were laughed at. 'Stupid cow'. No one had any sympathy. But what happened next would have defeated me utterly, had I not understood that O'Toole was beside himself with nerves.
Word of his drinking habits had spread, and we knew his professional future depended on his performance as Shylock.
Although he was prepared, his moods became darker and more erratic. He justified this in a most unexpected way — by taking the moral high ground over my sexual past (no worse than that of most of the actresses he admired and respected).
Weeks went by with constant criticism of my morals. Even in public, he'd be savagely critical.
Why did I put up with this? In spite of everything, I believed O'Toole was worth it. I loved him; I also knew he'd had a terrible childhood and that a lot of his bad behaviour resulted from that. (He swore me to secrecy, so I'll never reveal what he told me.)
In any case, his occasional periods of sobriety brought wonderful interludes of repentance and irresistible charm, when I believed myself supremely loved and needed; but when I was made to feel like a useless encumbrance, I believed that just as fervently.
After the birth of our daughter, Kate, he visited the ward just once, bearing a white television set. There was no aerial. It sat in a corner, silent and glamorous.
I first met Rudolf Nureyev in 1962 but by our next meeting, he had become a huge star and partner to the ballerina Margot Fonteyn. 
At a dinner given in Belgravia, he arrived straight after a performance, picked up a small bottle of plum brandy and drained it in seconds. 
Next, he seemed to levitate on to the table and danced down its length, extending his arms and deftly but forcefully lifting off several women's false hair-pieces. 
Margot had now also arrived, smiling and imperturbable. 
I was pregnant and wearing a green Dior velvet dress and jacket, trimmed with heavy jet beads. 
The heat and excitement proved too much and, as I stood chatting to Margot, I knew I was going to faint. 
As I began to fall, I felt someone catch me. 
And when I regained consciousness, I was floating in a stairwell. 
Rudi, I realised, was carrying me above his head. 
He was drunk and I weighed a ton.
 He took me to a nursery and we chatted until he began to throw up violently. 
'Come on, mush,' barked O'Toole, as he seized Rudi's legs and began to bump him down the thickly carpeted stairs. 
There were cries of, 'Be c­areful! Take care of his feet.' 
'To hell with his f*****g feet,' muttered O'Toole.
One night, I woke to hear the sounds of drunken revelry from the grounds outside — O'Toole and a car full of actors had left the pub to come and serenade his daughter. Hoping no one would wake up and complain, I lay silently in the dark, looking at the ceiling until they went away.
Another day, I overheard my doctor talking to the Sister. Referring to a gypsy girl and me, he said, 'Keep both of them in. Neither has a suitable home environment.'
I couldn't look at my daughter for shame.
At home, there was a flow of people to cater for while I kept my eye on the clock for Kate's next meal. My mother-in-law paid a brief visit. It was hard not to react when she urged drink on her son. Didn't she know, 'Just one more small one, son' marked the beginning of the end of an evening?
Later, we had a visit from his father — a bookmaker from Leeds who was a feckless, occasionally violent drunk. I saw only the man O'Toole had told me about: the father sitting his little boy on the mantelpiece. Arms outstretched, he'd say, 'Jump, boy. I'll catch you. Trust me.'
When the child jumped, the father withdrew his arms and, as the child fell to the ﬂoor, he said, 'Never trust any bastard.'
O'Toole thought this was a good story. I found it despicable.
Producing a baby did nothing to improve my status. When a childhood friend of O'Toole's came to visit, my husband abused my character in front of me and then collapsed into a deep sleep.
His friend looked at me, picked up a big bowl of dressed salad, and smiled as he slowly emptied the oily contents on to the pale green carpet. Then he picked up a half-empty bottle of Scotch and, still smirking, sauntered to his bed in the guest room.
I picked up the salad, washed the carpet and fetched a rug to cover O'Toole, asleep in an armchair.
When Kate was four weeks old, I went to the opening of The Merchant Of Venice. 'One of the great nights in the theatre,' they called it. At the wild curtain calls, I sat with tears rolling down my face. Whatever it cost, I had to do all I could to help cherish this talent.
Soon afterwards, I opened in a play myself — The Taming Of The Shrew. The atmosphere at home worsened; the scenes resumed.
By the time Kate was nearly ﬁve months, our house had become a kind of ramshackle hotel for people who wanted to see the plays and stay over. O'Toole was lavish in his offers of hospitality but usually not there to attend to his guests. I muddled through from one nightmare meal to the next, constantly doing laundry and making beds.
Early one morning, after hours of close, drunken questioning about my past, O'Toole overturned a table. Doors slammed and his car sped erratically down the long drive.
I walked out of the house and lay in the wet, long grass on the lawn in my nightgown. It was almost dawn but I didn't feel the cold. My wish was to get ill and die. 'Let me just leave,' I said aloud.
As dawn broke, I heard the country noises around me and returned to my senses. Kate was inside, sleeping in her basket. What was I thinking of? So long as she was there, I'd have to be there for her. Getting up, I returned to the house and sat on the ﬂoor, leaning against the wall, waiting until she woke. It was never worth confronting O'Toole about his behaviour. But sometimes, unable to resist speaking up for myself, I'd add fuel to the ﬂames.
In a rage, he would erupt out of the house, running in bare feet across the dark Warwickshire ﬁelds while I stood alone, crying.
O'Toole knew, of course, that he was wiping out my self-confidence. At times, he would be remorseful and beg for forgiveness — though never for anything specific.
One day, he announced that my parents were taking Kate for a week and he and I were going to the west of Ireland. I was back in favour. Why? For how long?
In seconds, bags were packed, the fridge emptied, the car loaded. Then O'Toole held out his hand and I could no more resist him than stop breathing. Two days later, I was sitting in an Irish pub with him, totally happy with my decision to stay married.
For a while, the trip had a miraculous effect on our home life. Now, most nights after his show, Kate and I were invited to supper at a restaurant, where she slept in her basket under the table.
At times, O'Toole clutched at me as though his life depended on me. Then, every so often, our bubble of normality would be punctured by scenes of appalling verbal abuse.
I lost my precarious happiness. Sadness, which I didn't think to characterise as depression, crept closer. The criticisms of me grew more frequent and one night, I decided to leave.
The next day, I assembled Kate's things, packed and called a taxi.
It was over. Or so I thought . . .

33,"Nigel Kennedy is munching biscuits and swigging tea from his Aston Villa mug. It's 10.30am: practically the crack of dawn, given that he was up necking plum vodka — 'My wife made it. I drink it. Teamwork!' he cries — until the early hours.
The virtuoso violinist is wearing one of Villa's vintage 'away' strips: 'Horrible, tasteless neon green and lurid red. I love it!' he chortles.
His allegiance to the Birmingham football club he has supported since boyhood is as ingrained as his commitment to making classical music accessible to everyone, not just an elite minority of 'condescending wannabe gentry', as he puts it.
Since his 1989 recording of Vivaldi's Four Seasons sold more than three million copies, making it the best-selling classical recording ever, he has been resolutely defying convention. And today, as he publishes Nigel Kennedy Uncensored!, a riotous, no-holds-barred memoir, he fires a volley of invective at his detractors and deplores the BBC's descent into political correctness.
He talks about drugs (yes, he smokes cannabis), sex, all-night partying — and how he's standing by his son Sark, 25, jailed earlier this month for drug-dealing after being caught with £15,500 worth of cocaine in his car.
'He knows that I'm around to offer him an alternative life and he knows that I love him. I'm going to see him (in prison) pretty soon so I'll remind him of that.
'I just hope he's going to be successful in what he's trying to do, which is to change his life and turn it around. But I'm not going to pull him up by the ear. It's not my place.
'We have all these relatives in Australia and it would be a really fantastic opportunity to start a new life there, away from his old circles. But he's an adult. You can give people opportunities but they have to make up their own mind.'
Nigel Kennedy, 64, is a man of fierce loyalties and ardently held opinions. I had expected bluster and braggadocio. I hadn't reckoned on humour, affability and charm. He's talking to me via Zoom from the studio of the timber house, remote in the Polish countryside, he shares with Agnieszka, 43, his second wife, and their elderly weimaraner, Huxley.
'We're in the wilderness. There are bears, but they're quite shy, not like American grizzlies, and wolves,' he enthuses. 'We've got a huge vegetable patch — Agnieszka instigated it — and beehives. We go hiking!'
He has always been provocative: his bog-brush hair and concert get-up mark him as a maverick. Long ago he eschewed the performer's traditional black tailcoat — the outfit of a 'poncing underpaid butler', as he puts it — and often performs wearing bovver boots, cargo pants and his football jersey. The stuffy elite deplore his anarchism; his vast army of fans applaud his determination to bring classical music to the masses.
He's been dubbed the 'punk violinist' and more acerbically, 'a latter-day Liberace with his ludicrous clothes'. (This from the late Sir John Drummond, one-time director of the Proms and controller of BBC Radio 3.)
He points out that Sir John — an 'elite toff' — at times garnered as few as 250 listeners at Radio 3, turning it into 'an unattainable exclusive club'. Meanwhile, Kennedy, a glittering alumnus of the Yehudi Menuhin School (the great violinist actually paid his fees) was packing the 5,000-seat Royal Albert Hall to the rafters.
'And I don't think he [Sir John] played the piano as well as Liberace,' he says. 'He was a purist; he didn't like Liberace's white piano and candelabra. I didn't really like Liberace either, but he was a skilful piano player.'
And Kennedy laments the fact that the taxpayer-funded BBC has become 'a teeth-gnashing, pitiful and desperately wannabe politically correct institution', concluding: 'Public reaction to this self-indulgence is already taking the shape of even more apathy and resentment, which will inevitably lead to refusal to pay the licence fee and the discarding of TV in general in favour of the internet.'
Kennedy renames one BBC First Night of the Proms the 'Farce Night', decrying its 'tedious desperation' to burnish its woke credentials after one singer dedicated her performance to 'transgender people all around the world'.
'What for? Why?' he asks incredulously. 'That type of irrelevant superficial claptrap was too much to take and had nothing to do with the music she was performing, unless she thought it couldn't stand up for itself.
'To think that we pay a licence fee to hear that kind of spouting. I respect everyone whatever their gender, but meritocracy is what we're looking for. This insistence on quotas and equality of outcome . . . there should be an equal chance for everyone as long as they're prepared to work hard.'
Kennedy, never reticent about expressing his views, was not prepared to let the singer's comments pass unremarked.
He was due to play Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending and Monti's Czardas, and during his rehearsal with the orchestra, he recalls: 'I quipped in a similar bleating manner to the singer, 'I would like to dedicate my part of the performance to all the forgotten and displaced heterosexuals around the world.' '
This light-hearted riposte misfired. He was met with an 'unamused glower' from two women in the viola section, 'As if heterosexuals shouldn't be recognised or allowed to celebrate anything'. 'The conductor also seemed rather unsupportive,' he adds.
'I know some people suffer from a chronic sense-of-humour shortage and I sincerely wish them a speedy recovery.'
Although he is Left-wing and fervently anti-elitist, he now finds his sympathies veering towards the white British middle classes.
'I've had a fair few good nights at the Proms. I've experienced a mixed feeling or two about the toffs waving Union Jacks. First of all, I found myself a bit averse to all of that jingoism, but now that everyone in the media is so anti-white British my feelings have become a bit more tolerant. Every other group of people is allowed to talk about their race and big it up.
'And once the Scottish finally have to leave our UK, we won't see the Union Jack any more and it's a shame, because it's a killa [great] looking flag.'
Such unfashionable views have, it seems, made him persona non grata at the BBC. 'They won't make any shows with me any more. Jimmy Savile was OK but apparently I'm not!'
He has always been a dissident, his soaring musical talent matched by rebelliousness and an epic capacity for partying.
Does he still love a shindig? 'Of course! There's a lot of adrenaline coursing round your body after a concert, when you're trying to deliver the best performance for the people who have paid to be there.
'Afterwards it's good to hang out with your mates. Often I'll invite members of the audience to a party. Everyone's welcome.'
He's famous for the epic duration of these parties: in his book he enumerates the many events to which police were called, grading various forces throughout Europe on the standard of their response.
(The Met come out top for turning a blind eye to the antics of the carousers at his home during one early-hours revel, merely requesting they kept the volume down.)
He goes off on a riff in praise of our police force: 'It's an amazing privilege to live in a society where we don't have armed police,' he says. 'The people who join the police are trying to help society and we ought to remember that.
'Maybe a few behind desks get a bit addled in the head, but the people on the streets are trying to benefit us. It's not a brilliantly paid job and there are huge expectations.'
He makes no secret of the fact that he smokes cannabis: 'I appreciate a good smoke. It has helped me become the improviser, composer and classical interpreter that I am today.'
But I wonder if his capacity for caning it has waned with age?
'I think you become more professional at handling drink as you get older, don't you?' he asks. When I tell him I hardly drink now he roars with laughter. 'Well there's no point in you coming to one of my parties then!'
I ask about his views on cocaine. When his son, Sark — who lives with Nigel's ex-wife, Eve, in Malvern — appeared at Worcester Crown Court earlier this month, he was jailed for 33 months after admitting possession with intent to supply the drug.
The court heard that he was selling 'wraps' of cocaine at £40 each after getting into debt since becoming addicted as a teenager, but was now determined to become a useful member of society.
'I've always been clear that I don't appreciate it [cocaine] in my circles,' Nigel says. 'I really hate that type of stuff. It doesn't improve the atmosphere. I've got a crackpot theory that coffee is a gateway for cocaine. It revs you up and makes you more hyperactive. I don't think you'd find many tea-drinkers like it.' He tops up his brew and takes another sip.
'My son knows what I think about it. It's not my place to tell him: 'You can't do that.' You give people opportunities and in the end they make their own choices.'
Is he a good dad? 'You learn as you go, but practice does not always make perfect,' he says.
'My son sees a lot of hard work going on in my house and he knows to get a life together you have to really work.'
Indeed, Nigel's work ethic is formidable. He practises for between three and six hours a day, striving constantly to improve.
'It's quite boring, what I'm doing. I write music. I get better at the violin. I work ceaselessly at it. And if I have a killa project like a gig at Madison Square Garden [the 20,000-seat New York arena], or if I'm writing something — I've just finished my first violin concerto — my life becomes very regulated.
'For a couple of months I have no sex or alcohol; no parties or any recreational stuff. It becomes a very focused life, and it really does help.'
I wonder what Agnieszka thinks about this monastic life.
'Oh I think she's pretty happy about it,' he laughs. 'She doesn't have to bother about me.'
'And you can still do a bit of hiking.'
'Exactly.'
They've been married for 23 years or so — he is hazy on dates and chronology, a fact that has got him into deep trouble with his wife, an actor and artistic director.
'Three years ago I forgot her birthday and I had to buy her a car,' he guffaws. 'My mate said, 'Well you've learnt from that. You won't forget next time.' But I did! I couldn't buy her another car — Greta [Thunberg] wouldn't like that — so I got her a toy one instead.'
We go off on a bit of a tangent, talking about Greta, from whom he is loath to take advice.
'Relatively speaking she's just a child.' He's sceptical about man-made global warming but is an ardent environmentalist.
'I hate to think of dolphins swallowing plastic. I went through a phase of leaving plastic packaging outside the supermarket. If they want to propagate it they should deal with it.'
He likes a bit of a rant. When we talk about the house he owns at the foot of the South Downs in West Sussex he says he's likely to sell it. 'The village there has lost its post office and I said, 'When they get rid of the pub, I'm off,' and they've turned it into a horrible wedding venue. It's a crime, isn't it?'
He's easy company; amusing, provocative and for all the privileges his exceptional talent has conferred, his early life was not plain sailing.
His father, John, a cellist, left his mother when Nigel was a baby, emigrating to Australia and returning later to become principal cellist with the Royal Philharmonic. His mum Scylla, a pianist, remarried when Nigel was a child and they moved from his native Brighton to Birmingham.
Nigel's stepfather, a doctor, was physically abusive to Scylla. 'As a small child I did jump on him and try to stop him once or twice, but it resulted in him chasing me round the house with a knife.
'It was a horrible thing.'
At the age of six he says he was subject 'to a form of abandonment' when he was sent away to the Yehudi Menuhin School in Surrey, having won a scholarship.
He was both precociously talented and determinedly single-minded. In his teens, while studying at the Juilliard School in New York, he was invited by jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli to perform with him at the city's Carnegie Hall.
He was told by his teachers that he would scupper his classical career if he did, but he defied them, with glorious results. And his challenging of convention and authority continued.
He recalls how he became the Punk Violinist by mistake when, flying from New York to perform a concerto at the Royal Festival Hall in London, he forgot his 'bat suit', as he calls it. Finding himself on a Sunday without the appropriate attire, he went to the only place that was open in the 1970s, Camden Market, 'and the only clothes I could get were punk stuff with chains and a gothic edge. I got all togged up for less than 50 quid'.
He has infuriated and entertained in equal measure ever since. Refusing to be pigeon-holed, he's performed with rock aristocracy: with Paul McCartney, The Who and Led Zeppelin; with Roy Wood of The Move and Deep Purple's Jon Lord.
Music snobs will always decry what they perceive as his philistinism. They have even, he says, disparaged him for playing Tchaikovsky.
'His music is looked down upon by some pseudo experts as being below top level, and this sets my bulls***ometer right off into the red,' he says.
'These pseuds try to discount this beautiful music because it has committed the cardinal crime of becoming phenomenally popular with classical audiences all around the world.'
He's off on a tirade again, inveighing against 'experts' who 'protect their status by pretending that something popular is s*** in order to appear as if they know more than us poor proletariat'.
'It seems that there's always an 'expert' on every subject, from global warming all the way to poor little music, portraying themselves as knowing better than us.
'But it's all hot air and no substance, reminiscent of the emperor and his new clothes.
'Mind you,' he adds as a coda, 'if we're to believe Greta et al, it won't be long before neither we nor the emperor will need any clothes.'

34,"Newly released bodycam footage shows the moment a 17-year-old girl warned police of the abuse her parents were inflicting upon her and her 12 siblings living in squalor, in the first time she had ever spoken to a person outside her family.
Jordan Turpin, now 21,  escaped her home and called the cops on her abusive parents on January 14, 2018. Bodycam footage from that night in Perris, California, shows a terrified girl struggling to speak but determined to rescue her siblings. 
Then 17, Jordan managed to escape her home out a window with a cell phone, which contained evidence of the abuse, walking down the middle of the street not knowing where she lived and shaking as she struggled to dial 911.   
'My whole body was shaking, I couldn't really dial,' Jordan, choking back tears as she described the moment she finally escaped the House of Horrors and made the 911 call, said during a 20/20 special set to air Friday.
Their parents, David and Louise Turpin, pled guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison in 2019.

The 911 dispatcher had stayed on the phone with the frightened girl until an officer arrived. Jordan is seen noticeably frantic, taking a moment to calm herself as she begins speaking with the officer. 
'Okay. I just ran away from home. And I live in a family of 15. My two little sisters right now are chained up,' she say as her voice shakes sounding much younger than 17. 
When the officer asks where the siblings are chained up she replies: 'On the bed now mother didn’t chain them up just to be mean. Okay. They’re chained up because they stole mother’s food.'
She strains to maintain her calm as she speaks to a person outside her home for the first time in her life. 'But…I’m sorry if I talk too much. Okay. I’ve never talked to anybody out there so I don’t- I’ve never been alone with a person so this is very hard for me to talk,' she tells the officer.
Questioning the frazzled teen who struggles to speak clearly, the officer asks if she's on any medication. 
'Medication? What's medication?' she asks back. The officer tries to help Jordan understand asking if she takes pills. 
'Oh. I don’t think I’ve ever tooken a pill before. Right, I haven’t,' she confirms in her broken vocabulary. 
She's then seen putting on a baseball cap, which ABC's Diane Sawyer explained in her interview was a reminder of one of her sisters. After nervously fixing the cap on her head, she dives back into the reason for her call. 
'Our parents are abusing. They abuse us. But the reason I called and the reason I managed to get out here this is one of the most scariest things I’ve ever done. I’m terrified. But I called because my two little sisters they’re chained up right now.' 
The officer asks if Jordan has any photos of the girls chained up and she excitedly confirms she took photos after one of her sisters told her to. 
'I don’t have proof of everything but I have proof that my sisters are chained up.'
Not knowing the word 'bruise' she tells the officer: 'See? Those are the places that make in on them. And see how dirty she is? We’re so filthy. We don’t take baths.'
The officer asks one more time: 'Your parents chained them up?'
'Yes, because they stole food. But they stole it because they were hungry,' Jordan confirms.  
Audio from the bodycam recorded the deputy asking Jordan: 'What are your parents going to do when they find out you left?'
'They are going to want to literally kill me,' she answers. 
Jordan's call to police lasted for 20 minutes because the girl struggled to work out her address because she had not been outside alone before.
'I had to make sure that if I left we wouldn't go back and we would get the help we needed,' she told Sawyer. 
Explaining her decision to finally escape, Jordan told Sawyer: 'I think it was us coming close to death so many times.'




'It was literally a now or never. If something happened to me, at least I died trying.'
'The only word I know to call it is 'hell,""' Jordan's sister Jennifer, 33, added in the trailer for the 20/20 special, set to air Friday.
'My parents took my whole life from me, but now I am taking my life back,' she said.
Jennifer doesn't doesn't want her siblings to be remembered as victims, but instead as fighters.
'I want the Turpin name [to be] ""Wow, they're strong. They're not broken. They've got this,'"" she said.
Jordan, describing life post-rescue, said: 'It's so free. Like wow, this is life.'
Jordan said she and her siblings came 'close to death so many times.'
'Mother, she choked me and I literally thought I was going to die,' she shared.
In her harrowing 911 call, Jordan sounded clear but agitated as she walked away from the home she was confined to most of the time and revealed everything to the dispatcher. 
'Um hello? I just ran away from home because I live in a family of 15. OK? Can you hear me? And we have abusing parents. Did you hear that?' Jordan Turpin tells a dispatcher.
When the dispatcher asked how her parents abused her and her siblings, she replied: 'OK, They hit us. They like to throw us across the room. They pull out hair. They yank out our hair. I have two ... My two little sisters right now are chained up.' 
Bodycam footage later shows officers enter the house, confront the parents and discover the children, at least two of whom were shackled to their beds. 
'Sarge, we've got another room in the front right here with two kiddos in the bed,' an officer says in the video.   
The siblings, ranging in age from 2 to 29 years old, were freed from the home in January 2018 after being regularly beaten, starved and strangled by their parents. 
The house was covered in filth and the stench of human waste was said to be overwhelming. Jennifer confirmed that the kids would often be chained up for months.
The parents' abuse and neglect was so 'severe, pervasive, [and] prolonged' that it stunted their children's growth, led to muscle wasting and left two of their daughters unable to bear children. 
Since the 13 Turpin children were rescued from their parents horror house in January 2018, they have been actively working to take back their lives. 
'They're all happy,' Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People in April 2020. 'They are moving on with their lives.'
His interview revealed the siblings still live in Southern California and remain close to each other, regularly getting together.  
'They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they'll meet somewhere kind of discreet,' he shared.
Beecham shared that the six youngest children had been adopted and, since they had experienced fewer years of abuse due to their ages, were able to quickly adjust to their new lives.
One of the older siblings has earned a college degree.  
Others are in school, living on their own and working jobs.
'Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,' Beecham explained. 
A few of the siblings, at the time of the interview, were still living in group homes as they received therapy and counseling.
Two of the Turpin sisters spoke out to Diane Sawyer, in an interview airing on November 19, revealing that they were moving forward with their lives. 
'My parents took my whole life from me, but now I am taking my life back,' one sister told Sawyer. 
The other described her new life as being 'free.'



Following David and Louise's arrests in January 2018, horrific details began to emerge of the extent of torture, abuse and neglect that the children.
Deputies testified that the children said they were only allowed to shower once a year.
They were mainly kept in their rooms except for meals, which had been reduced from three to one per day, a combination of lunch and dinner. 
For years, the siblings' diet consisted of nothing but two slices of bread with peanut butter or bologna. The couple were also accused of taunting their children with pies and other food that they were forbidden to eat.  
The Turpin parents chowed down on fast food in front of them, chaining the children to filthy beds if they tried to steal food. 
'They still can't look at peanut butter or bologna,' Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham told People magazine last year.
'I made the mistake of mentioning peanut butter during one of our meet-and-greets, and one of the girls almost threw up. And when they're at the grocery store, they can't look at peanut butter. They can't even go down the aisle where there's peanut butter.'
The Turpin offspring weren't allowed to play like normal children and were deprived of things other kids had, including toys and games. 



Sawyer also spoke with Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin, who was involved with the case. He says it is one he will never forget.
'It stopped me dead in my tracks,' he said. 'There are cases that stick with you, that haunt you.' 
David and Louise pleaded guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse in 2019 and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
They are both eligible for parole in 22 years.
The 13 siblings remained out of the public eye as their parents' case unfolded in court and they learned to adapt to normal life outside the confines of the house of horrors. 
Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People magazine that all of the siblings 'are happy.'
'They are moving on with their lives,' he added.
At that time, one sibling had graduated college, while several others had jobs or were going to school. 
'Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,' he shared. 
He also noted that the siblings see each other regularly.  
'They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they'll meet somewhere kind of discreet,' he said. 
Several of the siblings have changed their names to rid themselves of the stigma of being a victim in the high-profile case. 
'It would be difficult for them to carry that name, that label of being a victim, forever,' Beecham said. 
But Jennifer told Sawyer she wants to change what people think when they hear the Turpin name. 'I want the Turpin name, like wow, they're strong, they're not broken, they've got this,' she explained.

35,"A hospice nurse has shared the most common things that people say and right before they die, and she revealed that they often claim to see their dead relatives.
Julie McFadden, a registered nurse from Los Angeles, California, said her patients often tell her that they see their loved ones who have already passed on in their final moments, and that their deceased loved ones tell them things like, 'We're coming to get you soon,' or, 'Don't worry, we'll help you.'
Julie has worked in hospice care for more than five years after spending more than a decade working as an ICU nurse. She recently started sharing her knowledge and experience on TikTok, under the username @hospicenursejulie, and she has gained more than 430,000 followers and 3.6 million likes. 
Hospice care is a type of health care that focuses on helping terminally ill patients reduce their pain and suffering, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs at the end of life. 
Julie is often around death due to her job, and she has decided to clear up some misconceptions around what happens to people's bodies and minds when they die. 
According to the nurse, it's very common for dying patients to see their 'dead relatives, dead friends, or old pets that have passed on' during the last few weeks of their lives.
She said it happens so often that they put it in their 'educational packets that they give to patients and their loved ones' but that she can't explain why this occurs.
'This happens so often that we put it in our educational packets that we give to the patient and their loved ones so they understand what's going on. But we don't know why it happens and we can't explain it,' she said. 
'It usually happens a month or so before the patient dies. They start seeing dead relatives, dead friends, old pets that have passed on - spirits, angels, that are visiting them.
'Only they can see and hear them. Sometimes it's through a dream and sometimes they can physically see them and they'll actually ask us, ""Do you see what I'm seeing?""
Julie explained that the patients are 'usually not afraid,' but that they're actually very 'comforted' by it. 
She added: 'They're usually not afraid, it's usually very comforting to them and they say they're sending a message like, ""We're coming to get you soon,"" or, ""Don't worry, we'll help you.""
'Most people love this, they're very comforted by it, it's not scary to them. But yeah, we can't explain it and it happens all the time.'
When someone asked Julie if she thought it was a hallucination, she said that she didn't think so, since the patients are normally 'pretty alert and oriented.'
'I don't know what it is,' she continued. 'It doesn't seem like a hallucination to me because the people who are saying this are usually pretty alert and oriented, they're usually lucid.
'It's not like they're saying a bunch of crazy things that don't make any sense. They're usually functional and logical and questioning me, ""Why am I seeing my dead mom, do you see her?""
'I've seen hallucinations and what we're talking about here is not that. But I don't know.'
She also revealed that the most common thing people say right before they die is 'I love you,' and that they often call out to their mom or dad.
The woman wanted people to know that death is normally not painful, but instead, she called it a very 'peaceful and natural' process since 'our bodies are built to die.' 
'Our bodies are truly built to survive birth, for the most part, and they are built to die. When someone is on hospice dying a natural death, the body knows,' she explained. 
'The body will start kicking in its regular mechanism that are built in when someone is getting near death. It will stop eating and drinking for the most part and sleeping a lot more.
'The body was start preparing itself and helping the person have a more peaceful, natural death.'
She noted that although there are certain diseases that cause pain or discomfort, death itself does not normally hurt. 
'Now, there are certain diseases that people are dying from that can cause pain or discomfort so we, as hospice providers will help with that, and those symptoms,' she said.
'But that's from the disease, that's not from death or dying itself. We have found time and time again that the less we mess with the natural dying process, the more peaceful the death usually is.
'People believe that death equal pain, that dying is painful. And this is just not true. The disease you may be dying from, that can be painful and cause pain. But actual death is not painful.'
She also revealed that there are four things that often happen right before someone dies, which are: changes in breathing, changes in skin color, terminal secretions, and fevers.
She explained, 'When you're in the actively dying phase, which is a few hours or a few days before someone dies while on hospice, your body will sometimes lose its ability to hold its core temperature. You can spike a fever or get really cold or hot. 
'Breathing patterns change towards the end of life during the actively dying phase, which is usually a few hours or a few days before death.
'Most families think this indicates something is wrong, but nine times out of 10 it doesn't.' 
While speaking to The Sun, Julie said the best part of her job is 'educating patients and families about death,' and that she hopes to do the same through her TikTok videos.
'The best part about my job is educating patients and families about death and dying as well as supporting them emotionally and physically,' she said.
'Also, helping them to understand what to expect is another part of my job as a hospice nurse.
'I want to normalize death by educating people about it. I went home to visit my family, and my tween nieces were on TikTok making dance videos.
'I later went on TikTok to see their dances. This gave me the idea of starting my own TikTok about death and dying, four days later I did it and it took off.'",-2
36,"Disgraced former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke who was jailed for sexual assault has revealed that he is unemployed and plans to make a Universal Credit claim.
The former MP for Dover, who was released from prison in September, spoke of his financial woes during a court appearance on Friday over unpaid costs.
Mr Elphicke, who was branded a 'sexual predator' by his sentencing judge, served half of his two-year jail sentence for three sexual assaults on two younger women.
The 50-year-old's Friday appearance Uxbridge Magistrates' Crown Court was over his non-payment of a £35,000 sum, that he has now been ordered to pay within a year towards the cost of the prosecution.
The former Government whip, who is on licence until next year, he offered to repay his debt at £1 per month, which the court rejected.
'I find myself in a very difficult and embarrassed position,' he told magistrates, who he urged to 'give me time to the end of my sentence to get myself back on my feet'.
The court heard Elphicke received £51,000 from the sale of his marital home, but most of the money has been used 'in legal fees and to pay rent'.
He said he had paid six months' rent up front for a one-bedroom flat, valued online at nearly £475,000, in Fulham, south-west London, adding: 'That is why I have very limited cash to meet my living expenses.'
'I have made a claim for Universal Credit that is currently being processed,' Elphicke said. 'They are going to come back to me on December 12 to make sure I can pay the rent in an ongoing way.'
He told the court he had worked with the Step Change debt charity to assess his financial situation but the £1-a-month repayment proposal was not accepted by the court.
'I have no job, I have no career, I am long-term unemployed,' said Elphicke. 'I am working with the job centre and my probation officer to find a new career.
'I have made a claim for Universal Credit. I am separated from my wife who has filed for divorce. I have had to find a new place to live.'
The sentencing judge, Mrs Justice Whipple, said the sum would 'otherwise fall on the public purse'. 'You have substantial equity in your family home, which is currently up for sale,' she told him.
Elphicke's barrister Ian Winter QC had told the court his client had 'a fair bit of debt', and that his estranged wife, Natalie Elphicke, now the MP for Dover, loaned him £100,000 to pay for legal bills.
Magistrates agreed to adjourn the case to December 17, while Elphicke is waiting for his benefits claim to be assessed, with a payment order expected to be made at the next hearing.
Chair of the bench Andrew Gell said: 'It does not seem clear as what will be possible over the next 12 months so I think we wait until Universal Credit has been done, adjourning the matter until that has been completed and look at the matter again.'
In March, Elphicke lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his jail term after his lawyers argued the sentence was too long and should have been suspended.
The sentencing judge at the time described Elphicke as a 'sexual predator' who used his 'success and respectability as a cover' and told a 'pack of lies'.
During his trial, jurors heard how he had asked one of his victims about bondage and sex, then kissed her and groped her breast before chasing her around his home, chanting: 'I'm a naughty Tory.'
In the wake of the case, the Commons Standards Committee found five Conservatives, including his wife Natalie, had breached the code of conduct over an 'egregious' attempt to influence his legal proceedings.
As a result Mrs Elphicke, Sir Roger Gale and Theresa Villiers were suspended from the House of Commons for a day.
They, along with Bob Stewart and Adam Holloway, had written to senior members of the judiciary raising concerns that a more junior judge was considering publishing character references provided for Mr Elphicke.
Elphicke became a Government whip during David Cameron's premiership in 2015 but returned to the backbenches when Theresa May came to power the following year.
He had the party whip suspended in 2017 when allegations of sexual assault first emerged but it was controversially reinstated a year later for a crucial confidence vote in then-prime minister Mrs May.
The whip was withdrawn again the following summer when the Crown Prosecution Service announced its decision to charge Elphicke.  ",-2
37,"Pregnant women are at increased risk of severe complications from COVID-19 and they only rose during the Delta variant wave, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed.
Reports published by the agency on Friday found the rate of pregnant women dying of COVID-19 during the period of time where the Delta variant was the nation's dominant strain increased five-fold.
Pre-Delta, five out of every 1,000 pregnant women who contracted the virus during pregnancy died compared to a staggering 25 out of every 1,000 during the Delta period.
The researchers also found that pregnant women who were infected at time of birth were twice as likely to suffer a stillbirth.
The CDC team analyzed pregnancy death data from Mississippi from March 2020 to October 2021 for one their reports.
They found 15 deaths associated with Covid among pregnant women in the state during the 19 month period, out of 1,637 total infections recorded.
In the pre-Delta period, from March 2020 to June 2021, six deaths were reported among pregnant women - or five out of every 1,000 infections.
The number quickly ramped up during the Delta period, from July to October 2021, with nine deaths among pregnant women recorded - or 25 per every 1,000 infections.
Of the 15 women who died, 14 had an underlying medical condition that put them at even further risk of complications from the virus.
None of them were fully vaccinated, and only one was at least partially vaccinated.
Three died during their pregnancy, leading to two stillbirths and one spontaneous abortion.
Seven of the women required an emergency C-section operation in order for their unborn child to survive, and 12 women died shortly after giving birth. 
Twelve of the women were either black or Hispanic, highlighting already disproportionate maternal mortality rates in the U.S. 
A separate report published by the CDC of Friday afternoon investigated the rate of stillbirths suffered by pregnant women who were infected at the time of delivery.
The researchers gathered data from 1.2 million births nationwide from March 2020 to June 2021.
Stillbirths, when a baby is dead upon birth, are very rare, only occurring in 0.65 percent of women who are not infected with Covid. 
Within the dataset, 21,653 women gave birth while infected with COVID-19.
Those women were twice as likely to suffer a stillbirth, with 273 - or 1.26 percent - of babies not surviving delivery.
They were more common in the Delta period, with 2.7 percent of women who gave birth while infected from July to September 2021 suffering a stillbirth - a four-fold increase over the 0.63 percent figure posted by uninfected women.
Infected women who suffer from hypertension, an adverse cardiac event or required a ventilator due to Covid were most likely to have a still birth.
The researchers write that these data make vaccination against Covid even more important for pregnant women.
'Implementing evidence-based COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination before or during pregnancy, is critical to reducing the impact of COVID-19 on stillbirths,' researchers wrote.
Pregnant women are one of the least-vaccinated demographics in the United States, with only 35 percent being fully vaccinated, according to CDC data.
For comparison, nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. ",-2
38,"Britain's daily Covid cases rose by another 10 per cent today and deaths ticked upwards — but hospitalisations plunged 17 per cent.
Government dashboard data shows 44,242 positive tests were registered in the last 24 hours, a slight uptick from 40,375 last Friday.
Infections have trended upwards every day since November 11 except for one blip, with data suggesting cases are now rising in children following the return of schools from half-term.
Another 157 Covid deaths were also announced by health chiefs, in an eight per cent rise from the same time the previous week. Latest hospitalisation figures showed 827 admissions were recorded on November 15, which was down 17 per cent.
In a promising sign, the Government's scientific advisory group today said that it would take a much bigger rise in cases and rapid and sudden waning of the vaccines for Covid hospital admissions to rise to the level of previous peaks. But SPI-M, the modelling subgroup of SAGE, admitted that the epidemic was becoming increasingly harder to predict. 
It comes after the Office for National Statistics' weekly surveillance report suggested that England's Covid cases dipped by 10 per cent last week. 
The report, based on random swab tests done by thousands of Britons, estimated 824,900 people were infected on any day in the week ending November 13, the equivalent to one in 65 people. This was down slightly from 925,400 previously.
But in a warning sign that the downturn in infections has stalled, No10's top scientific advisers today claimed the R rate remained level between 0.8 and 1.0 last week.  
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He urged people to get their booster vaccines and warned of Europe's spiralling crisis, which saw Austria become the first country to impose another lockdown. 
Despite the growing concerns over the continent's outbreak, top experts are confident Britain won't be forced into cancelling Christmas again. One scientist behind a surveillance study showing cases were ticking upwards said he remained 'optimistic' that festivities could go ahead without any restrictions.
The ONS surveillance report relies on random swabbing of more than 100,000 Britons every week to estimate the prevalence of the virus across the country.
It is seen as the gold-standard method of tracking the country's outbreak by ministers because it is not affected by asymptomatic carriers.
Figures suggest Wales had the highest infection rate in the UK last week, with one in 55 people likely infected with the virus. It was followed by England and Northern Ireland, at one in 65, and Scotland, at one in 95.
Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 63.9 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus, one of the lowest uptakes of the jabs in western Europe. 
When cases were broken down by age groups, figures showed only 11 to 16-year-olds saw a drop in cases last week. Infections flatlined in all other groups.
Meanwhile, No10's top scientists estimated the R rate was still between 0.8 and 1.0, the same as the previous week.
But they said in London and the South East it could now be above the cut-off point and be as high as 1.1, which would mean an outbreak is growing. 
The R rate is a lagging indicator measuring how many infected people are passing the virus on. It reflects the situation on the ground up to three weeks ago, simply because of how it is calculated.
An R below one suggests that for every ten people who catch the virus, they are passing it on to fewer than ten others.
Two separate surveillance reports yesterday suggested Covid cases are now rising in younger age groups, too.
King's College London scientists, who track symptoms instead of tests, also estimated infections dipped 10 per cent overall last week, but they said cases appeared to be trending upwards among under-18s. 
There was still a drop in cases for over-75s, while they flatlined in all other age groups.
And the UK Health Security Agency weekly surveillance report, which is based on Government testing rates, estimated cases rose sharply in over-18s last week. 
It said cases also rose slightly among under-70s, but dipped in older age groups.
Britain's daily Covid cases also appear to be trending upwards, with rises in younger age groups and 50 to 65-year-olds appearing to drive the increase.
Professor Tim Spector, the eminent scientist who leads the King's College study, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' Christmas will be business as usual this year. 
He said: 'In terms of what it means for Christmas, I’m cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. It’s becoming clear that children and the school holidays play a key role in the waves of infection. 
'I think it’s safe to say that we can expect to see another rise in the new year after the holidays.'
But he still called on all Britons to get fully vaccinated against the virus, as well as ensuring they have their booster doses. And he urged everyone to start using face masks in crowded spaces such as public transport.
This was a softening in his tone from last month when he joined a chorus of experts calling on ministers to switch to Plan B — bringing back hated face masks, social distancing and work from home guidance. 
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He told a Downing Street press conference: 'Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to — non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions — get the boosters.' 
Austria is the first Western nation to mandate vaccines, but it far from the first.
A handful of tinpot dictatorships, smaller nations, and at least one large democracy has already issued vaccine mandates. They are:
Indonesia: President Joko Widodo made jabs mandatory in February this year, with anyone who refuses facing a £250 fine - roughly two months' salary - and being disqualified from receiving state benefits
Tajikistan: From July this year, all adults over the age of 18 were required to get vaccinated by order of the country's Covid task-force. It did not specify a penalty for those who refuse
Turkmenistan: Though dictator Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has refused to acknowledge having a single case in the country, he never-the-less made vaccination mandatory for all over-18s starting in July. Punishments for refusal were not specified 
Micronesia: A small South Pacific island nation, it mandated in July that its adult population had to be inoculated against Covid
New Caledonia: A French dependency also located in the South Pacific, it ordered its entire adult population to get vaccinated starting in September 
It comes after Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 66 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus. This is just below the 67 per cent average for the EU, and the UK where 68 per cent are double-jabbed. 
It is not the first country to make vaccines compulsory. Indonesia required all adults to get jabbed back in February, followed by dictatorships Turkmenistan and Tajikistan in July. Dozens of other countries, including many western nations, require specific groups — such as healthcare workers — to be fully inoculated. 
Speaking today, Schallenberg said: 'For a long time there was consensus in this country that we do not want vaccinations to be compulsory.
'For a long time, maybe too long, it was assumed that it would be possible to achieve a high vaccination rate even without an obligation. Now we have to face reality.
'Whipped up by radical anti-vaxxers, by fake news, too many among us didn't get vaccinated. The results are overcrowded intensive care units and enormous suffering,' he added, accusing the un-jabbed of launching an 'attack on the health system.' 
Ireland, which imposed a night-time curfew on hospitality businesses this week, has today placed its hospitals on a 'war footing' with routine operations cancelled to make room for Covid patients amid a warning from the country's top doctor that intensive care medics face 'unthinkable' choices over who to give care to.
And Germany's incoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz said almost 30 million vaccines need to be administered before the end of the year to ward off the worst effects of the winter wave, which would require the country to more-than double the number of shots it currently gives each day.
He spoke a day after Germany put forward new rules that would restrict the movements of unvaccinated people in states where hospital admissions are high. 
The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states.
It comes as the NHS app is being updated to show proof of booster jabs in a move which could save Christmas travel plans for the elderly and vulnerable.
It will appear on the travel section of the Covid pass, allowing Britons to visit parts of Europe which now require evidence of a third dose.
While the new feature will initially be limited to travel, it could also make it easier for the UK Government to make the third jab compulsory in domestic circumstances. 
Boris Johnson warned on Monday that the concept of full vaccination would need to be adjusted – with a third jab becoming part of it.
Almost 14million Britons have had the booster but the goal is to administer 40million to people over the age of 40. Younger adults may also be offered the jabs in the near future.
A small but growing number of countries, including Switzerland, Croatia and Israel, are now requesting proof of boosters for arrivals vaccinated many months ago.
France has indicated that proof of a third jab will be required for over-65s to access most venues from December 15.
Austria had required proof of a booster but announced today it is going into a full nationwide lockdown from Monday. The move, which comes just days after the Government imposed a lockdown only for the unvaccinated, makes Austria the first Western European to retreat back into a draconian shutdown since the summer.
A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs.",-2
39,"A terrified wife who died in a horror house blaze alongside her mother and two young children after calling her husband at work to shout 'fire, fire' has been pictured in a family photograph which emerged today. 
The Sri Lankan woman, named by relatives as Niruba, was killed along with her one-year-old daughter Shasna, four-year-old son Thabish and her own mother in the fire at her home in Bexleyheath, south-eat London, last night.
A brother-in-law escaped the flames by jumping from the top floor and breaking his legs. 
The touching family photograph released this afternoon shows Niruba and her mother with the two children at a family event. 
Last night the children's devastated father, Yogan Thangavadivel, was too upset to talk about the tragedy. He was being comforted by a string of relatives at his sister's home two miles from the scene of the tragedy in Bexleyheath, south east London.
Yogan, who works in an off licence, received a heart-breaking call from his wife at around 8.30pm on Thursday telling him their home was on fire. But the line went dead and he arrived back at the property to find his entire family had died.    
He was later seen 'screaming and crying' and collapsing on the ground outside the house as fire crews worked to retrieve their bodies.
Neighbours said they watched helplessly as the blaze tore through the semi-detached home after starting downstairs.
A faulty fire alarm may have led to the devastating inferno, it was claimed, as police and fire investigators probe why no alert was sounded after suggesting the was not suspicious.
The young children are believed to have died in their beds while their mother was hauled out of an upstairs window at the property but could not be saved.
The victims are believed to have moved to the area three months ago, after the £425,000 property was taken off the market.
A group of relatives - three women and two men - broke down in tears on the road this morning and were comforted by police in front of the blackened 1930s three-bed.
Neighbours and well-wishers were also laying flowers at the scene, with one saying: 'My heart aches for this loss of precious life to your family.'
Relatives told how Yogan had been at work when he got the call from his panicked wife at around 8.30pm. The blaze broke out as the grandmother had been packing bags to return to her home in Sri Lanka today.   
A cousin, who gave his name as Jega said: 'We've seen them recently at a wedding - two or three weeks ago. Happy children. It's an accident you can't prepare for.
'I think he said that a call from his wife and she was just shouting, fire, fire and the call went dead. It went silent.' He continued: 'The mother-in-law was supposed to be flying back to Sri Lanka today.
'What I heard is they were packing her stuff to get her to Gatwick today. They were upstairs - we don't know exactly where but it might have started downstairs or in the staircase.
'His brother-in-law was also upstairs, he jumped out of the window but he survived. It's so sad. It's so sad. Yogan can't speak. It's very sad - it's impossible to describe what he's going through.' 
'His brother-in-law is in hospital - no one has had the chance to speak to him yet. We've heard broken legs. It is a tragedy. You can't prepare for these kinds of things. You never expect things to happen in the family.
The relative said Yogan had bought the property, which is near the home of his two sisters, only three months ago. The family are understood to have lived in the UK for more than 15 years. 
A third cousin, who declined to give his name, said Yogan has now left hospital and is 'very upset'.   
Witnesses also told of the horror fire today. Builder Scott James, 44, said the house was 'quickly engulfed in flames' as smoke blew out to the street from about 8.30pm.
Mr James, whose home is a stone's throw away from the scene, said he saw people standing against a wall and one man laying alongside the wall.
He said: 'I got overwhelmed by smoke and then the whole house was engulfed. The downstairs was on fire and then the whole house went up. It was engulfed in flames. There wasn't an explosion.'
The man who was by the wall was 'distraught', he added. Mr James said he was worried and told the neighbours to get back, with the fire brigade turning up shortly afterwards.
Mr James said firefighters 'very quickly had ladders up to the windows,' as they tried to rescue those inside, adding: 'I am still in shock now about how quickly it all went.
'I saw the mum pulled out of the top window by a fire crew.'  
He said he saw the family only yesterday and had waved at them. 'I spoke to them just to say hello,' he added. 
'It was just pleasantries. It is very sad to wake up this morning and hear they have perished.'
One resident who lives nearby said he had been looking to buy the family's property before their purchase.
He said: 'It was on the market for £425,000 four months ago and I think it sold for more than that. It needed a lot of refurbishment. It's quite strange to see what happened knowing I could have been living there.'
Another neighbour said: 'It's absolutely terrible. We saw the blue lights flashing and looked out to see all the commotion.
'We could see they were trying to resuscitate somebody.' A woman added: 'It's shocking We just hope they can find out what caused the fire.'
One local, who asked not to be named, claimed they saw paramedics administering CPR on Thabish before he died at the scene.
Irene, 70, told MyLondon: 'I heard a loud bang at 5.30pm which shook me. Then at 8.30pm, I came outside to see ambulances and firefighters at the scene. The fumes were toxic.'
Mother-of-three Ling Han, 36, used to see the family as her garden backs onto theirs. She said: 'I only knew it was a couple living there with their two young children. We would see them from our garden.
'It was a little girl who was pre nursery, only two or three years old, and then a slightly older boy who I think was reception age.
'One man seemed okay and went off in an ambulance around 10.30pm. He looked very sad and helpless. It was awful. I feel scared and I'm in shock. As a mum, it has really hit home.'
Six bouquets of flowers were left at the entrance to the road while two police officers remained stationed behind the tape this morning.
A fire engine was parked in the residential street between two large blue plastic sheets hung up to block the view from either end.
The windows of the burnt out semi-detached house, which is the first on the right from Pickford Lane, were visibly black and singed with glass missing.  
Six fire engines and around 40 firefighters were called to the horror blaze at the house on Hamilton Road last night.
Crews in breathing apparatus rescued the two women and two children from the first floor using a 30ft ladder, but they all died at the scene. 
The home is near St Thomas More Catholic Primary School as well as Brampton Primary Academy and is not far from Bexleyheath Station.
Houses have sold recently for around £500,000 on the street, with the latest - a three-bed semi-detached - going for £480,000 in February 2020.
James Morford, London Fire Brigade's Borough commander for Bexley, said at the scene today the children were 'infant age'.
He said: 'Last night, roughly about 8.30pm, we were called to a house fire. Crews attended very quickly from the local fire station. Immediately on the scene, they identified they needed extra resources. They were ordered.
'Crews very quickly got to work using their tactics which they practice on a daily basis. From there they used a nine meter ladder and breathing apparatus to make access to the building and carry out four rescues.'
Asked what may have caused the fatal fire, Mr Morford said: 'Unfortunately at this stage I can't answer that. We don't know.
'I've got a fire investigation team that are going to come back later on this morning. Hopefully from there, with the help of our Met Police colleagues and our scientific advisor, we will be able to establish a cause.' 
London Fire Commissioner Andy Roe said last night: 'This is a truly terrible incident which is both sad and shocking.'
He added: 'Our thoughts are with the family, friends and local community at this difficult time.' The Brigade was called at around 8.30pm and the incident was over by around 9.45pm.
Firefighters from Bexley, Erith, Plumstead, Lee Green and Sidcup fire stations were in attendance. The cause of the fire is under investigation.
A Met Police spokesman said earlier today: 'Police were called at approximately 8.30pm on Thursday to reports of a fire at a residential address in Hamilton Road, Bexleyheath.
'London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service attended with officers. Two adult women, and two children - believed to an infant boy and girl - were pronounced dead at the scene.
'Their next of kin have been informed. A man remains in hospital with injuries to his legs. His condition is not thought to be life-threatening.
'A further person was taken to hospital by LAS after he arrived at the scene. Next of kin are aware and receiving specialist support.
'The deceased are all believed to have been related to each other. At this early stage, the cause of the fire is not thought to be suspicious and there have been no arrests.'
Detective Chief Superintendent Trevor Lawry, head of policing for Bexley, Lewisham and Greenwich said: 'Our thoughts are with the family of the deceased, who have suffered such an awful and devastating loss.
'We have officers in the location and I know these sentiments are shared by residents across the Bexley and London as a whole.
'Our inquiries are ongoing and we will continue to work with our colleagues in the London Fire Brigade to fully understand the cause of this terrible incident. In these very early stages we don't believe the cause of the fire is suspicious.'
Bexleyheath and Crayford MP Sir David Evennett tweeted: 'Shocked and saddened by the tragic house fire in Bexleyheath. Our condolences and thoughts are with the family and friends.'
Sadiq Khan said: 'I am heartbroken to hear that two women and two children tragically lost their lives in a house fire in Bexleyheath last night. My heart goes out to their loved ones and the local community at this awful time.'",-2
40,"Boris Johnson's refusal to declare his freebie family holiday to Spain on the parliamentary register has been approved by the Commons sleaze watchdog, No10 said today.
The PM's spokesman said standards commissioner Kathryn Stone had 'agreed with the approach' that listing it on the ministerial register was enough.
The apparent decision by Ms Stone means that Mr Johnson will never have to disclose how much the week at a luxury villa owned by the family of Lord Goldsmith was worth. 
However, the premier has included an estimated value for free use of the VIP departure suite at Heathrow in the the latest edition of the Commons register.  
The facilities at the Windsor Suite - including a personal butler - would have been £1,800 for Mr Johnson, wife Carrie and their son Wilfred had they paid personally.
Downing Street has previously claimed that because the Johnsons' holiday in Spain last month was provided by a minister it falls outside the remit of the House of Commons financial probity watchdog. 
The ministerial register of interests stated it was offered free of charge by Lord Goldsmith, a former MP and friend of Mrs Johnson who was handed a peerage by Mr Johnson after losing his Commons seat in 2019.
But an entry on the separate MPs' register would require revealing how much the benefit in kind was worth. 
A spokesman for the PM said today: ‘The parliamentary standards commissioner has agreed with the approach taken by the PM that the substantive family holiday in Spain does not require a separate Commons registration.
‘The PM took advice as well from (ministerial interest adviser) Lord Geidt and he registered it as per the rules.’  
The Torre Tramores estate, where the Johnson family stayed, is available for private rent at a cost of £25,000 per week for a secluded retreat with its own private helipad. 
Questions had been raised over Mr Johnson's declaration, not least because previous freebie holidays have been declared on the Commons register rather than the ministerial version. The latter is typically used for listing interests such as charity patron roles, and the fact that RAF Northolt is in Mr Johnson's constituency. 
There were also doubts over whether use of the villa could be classed as a gift solely from Lord Goldsmith, as it is owned by the wider Goldsmith faily. 
The standards commissioner's office refused to comment on an individual case. 
Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner declined to say whether the watchdog had informed her that her call for an investigation had been rejected. 
The Windsor Suite is close to Terminal 5 at the west of London airport.
According to its website, guests can await their flight in one of eight private lounges, adding: 'Meeting you at our private suite will be one of our doormen who will escort you inside where your personal butler is waiting.'
It also boasts a food menu from Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton and offers the use of a personal shopper in the main terminal building.
The facility has previously been used by VIPs including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the singer Adele. 
He was given hospitality for three people in the lounge on October 7, the register shows. 
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: 'It is utterly ludicrous that the only donation that Boris Johnson has declared related to his latest freebie luxury holiday is the hospitality he enjoyed in the lounge waiting for his plane.
'The Prime Minister was given a gift by someone that he gave a peerage and a ministerial job to and the Prime Minister needs to tell us the truth about his donations.' 
A No 10 spokesman said the holiday provided by 'a longstanding friend' had been registered correctly.
However, the ministerial code entry says the property was provided by 'the Goldsmiths', not just the minister.  
Labour has demanded a probe into the holiday by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. 
Goldsmith is the former MP for Richmond Park who was elevated to the peerage by Mr Johnson after losing his seat to the Liberal Democrats.
The move allowed the 46-year-old to remain in Government as an environment minister. He is currently Minister for the Pacific and the Environment having been given an additional role in a 2020 reshuffle.
The stay at the Torre Tramores in early October sparked fury as Mr Johnson left the UK amid a gas price crisis that struck businesses. ",-2
41,"Poor pensioners will be hardest hit by a watering down of social care reforms, the architect of the original cap warned last night.
Sir Andrew Dilnot gave a withering assessment of a change to the way the new social care cap will work, warning it would hurt those in northern constituencies.
Ministers yesterday faced a fierce backlash over the move, which was quietly announced on Wednesday.
Under the change, only people’s personal contributions will count towards the £86,000 cap – the value of any state support they receive will not.
This means that the less well-off, who get Government help to pay their bills, would have to pay out for longer before they hit the cap.
Sir Andrew said the change would mean anyone with assets of less than £186,000 would lose out – affecting around six in ten social care users.
Those with assets of £106,000 or less would be hardest hit by the changes – 30 to 40 per cent of those needing care – but it will not make a difference to those with more than £186,000.
Sir Andrew, an economist, said that those living in northern England and in areas with lower house prices are likely to be the worst affected.
And he warned that for people needing significant care for a long time, the change meant the less well-off would not ‘gain any benefit’ from the cap.
The Government said the change – which is likely to save the Treasury £500million – would ensure people ‘do not reach the cap at an artificially faster rate than what they contribute’.
But Sir Andrew told MPs yesterday that there is a ‘sort of North-South axis’ to the plans.
‘On the whole, this will tend to hit less well-off people obviously harder,’ he explained to the Commons Treasury committee.
‘It will tend to hit people in regions of the country with lower house prices harder than it does those in regions with higher house prices.’
Boris Johnson dismissed the criticism, insisting the social care caps would be ‘a massive improvement for everybody in the whole country’.
He told reporters yesterday: ‘What we’re saying is for the first time in history we’re stopping people having to pay unlimited quantities for their care.
‘We’re restricting the amount you can possibly pay to a fixed limit and the state comes in and helps you, the state comes in and helps you as soon as you have assets of £100,000 or less.
'And that’s never been done before.’
But the Prime Minister was warned by Tory MP Stephen McPartland that the move risked turning voters against the party.
‘We need to put social care into the hands of our NHS with local GPs at the heart of the service to patients and their families,’ he told the Daily Mail.
‘These “little tweaks” just undermine any trust in the Government and the system as millions of people will believe they are supported when they are not.
‘All MPs hear from families, every week, that have fallen through the cracks or the funding is not available and ask us to intervene, but the care system is broken.
‘It needs to be transparent and clear, these little tweaks always hit the poorest families hardest and turn voters against us as they feel let down.’
Labour’s social care spokesman Liz Kendall said the cap ‘is a complete con’. Referring to the health and social care levy, which will be introduced to pay for the policy, she said: ‘Ordinary working people are facing a tax hike that will do nothing to improve care now, and instead of protecting their parents’ homes, will only protect the homes of the wealthiest in our society.
‘Once again the Tories have failed to stand up for those who need care and their families.’
In 2011, a commission headed by Sir Andrew recommended capping the amount someone should pay for care in their lifetime at between £25,000 and £50,000.
The Government is proposing a lifetime cap of £86,000 from October 2023, with people with assets less than £20,000 paying nothing and those with up to £100,000 contributing to their care. 
How can they take away cash they promised? 
Commentary by Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK
The Government seems to have lost the plot on social care. Having promised to make a real difference with a reform plan which would – in Boris Johnson’s words – ‘fix’ social care and put an end to ‘catastrophic costs’, we find ourselves in a place that doesn’t remotely measure up.
At the beginning of September, to great fanfare, the Prime Minister announced in Parliament a new system that would put an £86,000 cap on the costs of personal care, such as washing, dressing and eating, from October 2023.
For many older people who feared that their care bills would wipe out all they had worked for –and force them to sell their homes in their lifetimes – this seemed to offer them and their families welcome reassurance.
By contrast, the change to the rules announced on Wednesday was issued through a written ministerial statement – the most under-stated form of announcement a Government can make.
So perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that it contained bad news – once your assets fall below £100,000 and you start to get some help with care costs from your local council on a sliding scale until those assets reach £20,000, those council contributions won’t count towards the £86,000.
Now we know that the cap will help far fewer people than expected because it will take everyone longer to reach the £86,000 threshold.
In effect, the Government is taking away some of the cash it had allocated to the cap, leaving older people to shoulder more of the cost themselves.
Sir Andrew Dilnot, the key architect of social care reform who gave evidence to the Treasury Select Committee yesterday, made his extreme disappointment clear.
The people who will lose out the most are not those with a lot of money tied up in expensive homes, but those whose homes aren’t worth so much – probably living in the Midlands and the North where house prices are lower.
Not only is social care reform turning into a scheme that will help only the very well-off, it flies in the face of the Government’s levelling-up agenda.
If you wanted to level up, surely you’d have done something that made the better-off contribute more to their care for longer?
Instead, the Government – with the Treasury presumably eager to claw back some money post-pandemic – has done it the other way around.
Many people who had put their faith in this cap now look likely to be disappointed. It means their chances of passing on an inheritance, which we know lots of older people care deeply about, have been diminished – particularly if they haven’t got very much behind them in the first place.
Social care isn’t a nice-to-have extra. It’s an essential service that allows hundreds of thousands of people to maintain some quality of life and/or independence.
It is no secret that the sector is really struggling. Many older people cannot be discharged from hospital because there are too few places in care homes or because care packages to enable them to live in their own homes have not been set up.
Too few care workers are a big cause of the problem. In the absence of any Government action to improve their terms and conditions, care staff are being lured away into retail and hospitality, and sometimes the NHS.
The Government could help by giving care staff a pay rise now, but this week’s development has done little to instil confidence that they’ll make the right call.  ",-2
42,"Mask wearing is the single best public health measure to stop the spread of Covid other than vaccination, a study has found — despite scientists still being split over their effectiveness at a population level. 
A review of six real-world studies on coverings, involving nearly 400,000 total participants, by Monash University researchers in Australia and the University of Edinburgh, concluded that widespread use can cut Covid rates by up to 53 per cent.
But the academics admit that there is significant variation in the studies depending on the methodology used and also identified the risk of bias in the results. 
There has been fierce scientific debate about how well masks work at reducing transmission, despite nearly every country in the world mandating or encouraging their use. 
Lab tests and observational studies have shown masks can block infected people from exhaling up to 80 per cent of the virus into the air and also protect wearers from inhaling up to 50 per cent of the particles.     
But real-world studies, which involve more scientific rigour, have produced mixed results, with some showing they have a huge impact on infection rates and others showing virtually none.
Any protection offered can also depend on the type of mask worn, with medical-grade coverings much better than cloth or surgical masks, as well as if someone wears them correctly. 
It comes as data suggests three in 10 under-30s across the UK have abandoned mask-wearing in public, despite the coverings being a legal requirement in Scotland and Wales.  
In the new study, published in the BMJ, researchers examined a total of 35 studies, the majority from Asia. One was a randomised controlled trial and others were observational.  
Of the research trials, 26 assessed measures such as social distancing and lockdowns and 12 analysed personal protective measures like mask wearing.
After examining all the data for each social and personal protective measure the researchers then determined if they could calculate an overall figure in risk reduction
The researchers also found handwashing and social distancing helped curb the spread of virus between members of the public. 
Handwashing, similar to masks, was found to reduce Covid transmission by 53 per cent, but the authors said this finding was not statistically significant due to the low number of studies examining the measure.
Social distancing was found to reduce Covid cases by 25 per cent.
They added the use of interventions like masks, social distancing and handwashing would help protect the public if a Covid variant emerged that was different enough to not be impacted by the vaccines. 
The researchers did not explore the impact of combing such measures.  
Other public health measures, such as full or partial lockdowns or working from home, were not possible to assess due to the variation in the studies examining these initiatives. 
Academics argued while vaccines were safe, effective, and saved lives, they did not offer 100 per cent protection, making it critical that people do what they could to reduce transmission rates. 
Vaccines have been proven to massively reduce a person's chance of catching Covid, but this protection drops to 40 per cent for the AstraZeneca and 60 per cent for the Pfizer and Moderna after six months. 
The findings come as fresh data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) shows 29 per cent of Britons under-30-years-of-age didn't wear a mask when they went outside their home in the last week. 
While mask wearing was phased out as a legal requirement in most places on July 19 people still need to wear them in health settings like hospitals and care homes.
This is to help protect vulnerable people like the elderly or those undergoing cancer treatment, as well as staff who interact with them from a possible Covid infection. 
There are exemptions however, with the following groups some of those not required to wear masks:
Outside of health settings official Government guidance is that the public should wear masks in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet, such as public transport.
The ONS gathered data on mask usage which shows adherence to wearing masks rises as people get older.
In comparison, only 18 per cent of 30-and-49-years-olds didn't wear a mask outside, falling to 10 per cent in the over 50s and 4 per cent in the over 70s. 
In total 85 per cent of adults reported wearing a mask during the last week, this compares to 97 per cent who reported doing the same at the same time last year. 
When you need to wear a mask in the UK is currently dependent both of what you are doing and where in the country you live. 
In England compulsory mask wearing was ditched in July as part of the so-called 'Freedom Day' removal of pandemic restrictions though people are still required to use them in health and care settings. 
Masks are also still recommended to be used in spaces where social distancing is impossible.
In Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland masks are legally required on public transport and in most indoor venues, with the notable exception of pubs and restaurants. 
Exceptions to compulsory mask wearing apply in all countries for people such as young children and for people whose physical and mental disabilities mean they cannot wear a mask easily or safely. 
The evidence of using masks to stop the spread of Covid has fluctuated over the course of the pandemic.
Some individual studies, like the new research by the international team, have come out in favour of masks like one from the ONS in September, which found people who did not wear them were up to twice as more likely to catch the virus.
Other studies have found the protection offered differs widely based on what kind of mask is used, with one study finding commonly used blue surgical masks only offered 10 per cent more protection than going bare-face.  
Research on how well various types of masks and face coverings protect against coronavirus has varied but experts and politicians have generally leaned towards the idea that the chance of some protection is better than none.
In the UK, face coverings were first made mandatory in for public transport in June and later for shops and other indoor spaces in July. 
Here's what studies have shown so far about whether masks work: 
FACE MASKS LOWER VIRUS R RATE (JANUARY 2021)
Researchers at Boston University in the US found wearing face masks is an effective way to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The study, published in the journal Lancet Digital Health, found a 10 per cent rise in self-reported mask wearing is associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of keeping the R number – the number of others each person with coronavirus infects – below 1.
Co-author of the study Ben Rader, of Boston Children's Hospital and Boston University, said: 'An important finding of this research is that mask wearing is not a replacement for physical distancing.' 
INFECTIOUS DROPLETS WILL STILL SLIP THROUGH (DECEMBER 2020)
Scientists at New Mexico State University in the US found wearing a cloth mask may not shield the user totally from coronavirus because infected droplets can slip through, but it would significantly reduce how many.
'Wearing a mask will offer substantial, but not complete, protection to a susceptible person,' said Dr Krishna Kota, an associate professor at the university who led the research.
The study found while all masks blocked at least 95 per cent of droplets from coughs and sneezes - there was still a risk of the disease being passed on.
A MASK 'WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER THAN NOTHING' (DECEMBER 2020)
Research by the University of Massachusetts Lowell and California Baptist University in the US found wearing a used three-layer surgical mask can reduce the number of small droplets that are released into the air by two thirds.
Co-author Dr Jinxiang Xi said: 'It is natural to think that wearing a mask, no matter new or old, should always be better than nothing.
'Our results show that this belief is only true for particles larger than five micrometers, but not for fine particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers.' 
MASK-WEARERS EQUALLY LIKELY TO CATCH VIRUS (NOVEMBER 2020)
A study by Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark suggested face masks may only offer the wearer limited protection against Covid infection.
Researchers found there was no statistically significant difference in the number of people who contacted the virus in a group wearing masks in public compared to a group that did not do so.
The study was carried out in April and May when Danish authorities did not recommend wearing face coverings. 
MASK LEADS TO THOUSANDS FEWER COUGH DROPLETS (AUGUST 2020)
Research by Edinburgh University in Scotland suggested cloth face masks are effective at reducing the amount of droplets spread by coughing or sneezing.
The findings suggest a person standing two metres from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to 10,000 times more droplets than from someone standing half a metre away wearing a basic single layer mask. 
Professor Paul Digard, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, said: 'The simple message from our research is that face masks work.
'Wearing a face covering will reduce the probability that someone unknowingly infected with the virus will pass it on.'
N95 MEDICAL MASKS COULD PREVENT 99% OF SPREAD (AUGUST 2020)
A study by Duke University in North Carolina, US, found N95 masks are the most effective masks at reducing the spread of Covid-19.
The research published in the journal Science Advances, studied 14 types of face coverings.
Co-author Dr Eric Westman said: 'If everyone wore a mask, we could stop up to 99 percent of these droplets before they reach someone else.
'In the absence of a vaccine or antiviral medicine, it's the one proven way to protect others as well as yourself.' 

SURGICAL COVERINGS JUST AS GOOD AS N95 MASKS (MARCH 2020)
A University of Oxford study published on March 30 last year concluded that surgical face masks are just as effective at preventing respiratory infections as N95 respirators for doctors, nurses and other health care workers. 
N95 respirators are made of thick, tightly woven and moulded material that fits tightly over the face and can stop 95 percent of all airborne particles, while surgical masks are thinner, fit more loosely, and more porous.
The Oxford analysis of past studies - which has not yet been peer reviewed - found that surgical masks were worth wearing but any face mask is only as good as other health and hygiene practices.",-2
43,"A father has died just three weeks after being diagnosed with cancer.
Jamie Christie, 40, who worked in a steel plant in Scunthorpe, Linconshire, lost his battle with the disease on November 12, nine days after marrying long-term girlfriend Sophie Christie in an emotional service. 
Friends and family rushed to organise the wedding after Jamie, who has eight-year-old son Dudley, discovered on October 21 that he had oesophageal cancer which had spread to his spine, liver, and other organs. 
Oesophageal cancer, which typically affects people in their 60s and 70s, is difficult to detect in the early stages due to a lack of symptoms. 
Jamie, described as a 'gentle giant' by friends, went to the doctor after feeling unwell and experiencing symptoms. 
Since his death, Jamie's friends have set up a donation page to raise money to support his wife and son.   
His close friend Lee Gibb, 40, said it was 'crazy' how quickly his health had declined. 
Lee said: 'He was probably one of the fittest people you've ever met in your life.
'He was a gym enthusiast, he was a boxer, and he used to play rugby for Scunthorpe rugby club. He was a sportsman, and he didn't smoke. It's just been absolutely crazy.'
Lee explained Jamie was diagnosed after he went to the doctors to undergo tests. 
He continued: 'They then gave him two to eight weeks to live - he was absolutely riddled with cancer. The doctor has even said, ""We can't believe he's stood in front of us.""'
Within a matter of days, Jamie's friends put a plan in place for him to wed his long-term girlfriend, Sophie, who he had been in a relationship with for years.
The couple chose Scunthorpe Rugby Club as their marriage venue, where Jamie played regularly, and the event was fixed for November 3.
Oesophageal cancer is a disease caused by tumours growing in the food pipe between the mouth and stomach.
The cancer is most common among people in their 60s and 70s and affects more men than it does women.
Oesophageal cancer can be hard to spot because it doesn't cause any symptoms in its earlier stages, and only becomes noticed once the tumour has grown.
Symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, persistent indigestion or heartburn, loss of appetite, weight loss, and pain in the torso, chest or back. 
Survival rates are not high for oesophageal cancer, with only 12 per cent of people surviving for 10 years after a diagnosis.
Six out of 10 patients die within a year of being diagnosed, according to Cancer Research UK.
The exact cause of the disease isn't well known but smoking, drinking too much alcohol, being overweight or having an unhealthy diet are believed to increase someone's risk of getting it.

On the day itself, Lee said that despite his physical struggles, he'd never Jamie looking so happy.
He said: 'I've never seen him smile so much in my life, and I've known him for 30 years. You could see that the cancer was attacking him, and you could see his weight loss and the tiredness in his eyes and everything else.
'But the smile on his face will stay with me for the rest of my life. He just smiled from morning until night.'
He added: 'Jamie was just a strong character. He didn't whinge about what was going on. He didn't shed a tear at the wedding about it. He just stayed strong all the way through to the end.'
Lee said that though they did everything they could to make it a celebratory day, for many at the event, it also felt like a final 'goodbye'.
'We had him up singing, we tried to make it the best we could for him, but it was also a goodbye for a lot of people as well.
'It was a crazy day, but we all put our brave faces on for Sophie and Jamie and celebrated the wedding.'
Jamie died on November 12, nine days after his wedding, and Lee and his other close friends were informed soon after.
He said: 'Jamie passed on the Friday at 9:45 at night. The family kept it quiet until the Saturday morning, then we rang each other. We all met at the pub on Sunday and raised a glass to him.
He added: 'Our social media in our area has been taken over by Jamie since he passed away. It's just everywhere and everyone. I've never seen anything like it after someone's passing.'

44,"A hero surgeon who died of Covid while saving patients on the frontline was double-vaccinated but caught the virus just days before boosters became available, his devastated family has revealed.
Grieving widow Saila Halim said Dr Irfan Halim, 45, passed away at Royal Brompton Hospital in West London on November 14 following a nine-week battle with the virus.
The doctor, who had no known health conditions, received his second vaccine in January but was struck down by the disease on September 10, six days before Britain's booster programme was given the green-light.
As a frontline NHS worker who was vaccinated nine months ago, he would have been at the front of the queue for the crucial third shot when they were rolled out on September 16.
Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Mrs Halim said today: 'My husband worked away from London and I'm not sure which vaccine he received but he was double vaccinated and always wore full PPE when he was on the wards.'
Fighting back the tears, she continued: 'He never said anything about getting the booster and I don't think he got one.
'It makes you question the efficiency of the vaccine but now is not the time for me to think about these things because I'm so heartbroken.
'It's a double tragedy for the family and we are in too much pain to consider anything else.'
Dr Halim's death came just two months after he had taken up work on the Covid ICU wards at Great Western Hospital, Swindon, where he collapsed on shift and is believed to have contracted the virus.
Even though the vaccines offer very high protection against serious illness and death, they start to wane at around six months and are not 100 per cent effective. Dr Halim's age, vaccine status and general health should have put him at a lower risk of dying from Covid, even though it had been nine months since his second dose. 
The surgeon was thought of as a medical powerhouse and described by colleagues as like '10 men in one body' after treating 250,000 patients throughout his career. 
He was isolated from his family for four months at the height of the pandemic last spring while treating Covid patients on the front lines.
Mrs Halim revealed she spared her husband the additional grief that his father Kamal, 75, also a doctor, died in another London hospital from Covid on September 24. 
It comes as Covid cases continued to rise across the UK, with 44,242 infections recorded today — up nearly 10 per cent next week. Deaths were also up 8 per cent in a week with 157 victims registered over the past 24 hours.
The risk of Covid killing someone in their forties who is double-vaccinated remains small – even without a booster vaccine.
Even though the vaccines have been shown to wane at between four and six months, they still offer very high protection against serious illness and death. 

Real-world UK data shows that people who were given two Pfizer vaccine doses still have about 85 per cent protection against death from the dominant Delta variant six months later - compared to the near-perfect protection earlier in the year.
Those who received two shots of AstraZeneca have very slightly less protection at the half-year mark, with the effectiveness falling to about 80 per cent.
At six months, Government data shows the Pfizer vaccine offers about 90 per cent protection against hospitalisation. For AstraZeneca's, the figure is just under 80 per cent. 
The vaccines are much weaker at preventing someone from getting infected after six months, however, with the AZ vaccine offering 40 per cent protection versus Pfizer's 60 per cent. 
But early data from the UK's booster rollout has shown that the third dose can top-up immunity against infection to 93 per cent again.
Although it's too soon to put an effectiveness estimate against hospitalisation and death, officials say they expect it to be 'much higher'. 
Separate figures suggest that someone in their forties now has between a one in 4,000 and one in 500 chance of dying from Covid.
The Cambridge University analysis includes both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, with other studies suggesting the risk is much lower for a double-jabbed person.
Someone in their 70s, for comparison, has a one in 30 chance of dying from Covid, and for those aged 65 to 75, the rate is one in 120.   
His death came two months after he had taken up work on the Covid intensive care unit wards at Great Western Hospital, Swindon.
Dr Halim was one of the first priority groups to get vaccinated against Covid in December 2020. He received his second dose the following month, in line with the three-week dosing guidance at the time.
The time between first and second vaccine doses has since been extended to between eight and 12 weeks in the UK after studies showed the longer interval increases the strength and duration of immunity.
He is believed to have contracted the virus here before collapsing during a shift on September 10. After initially being treated at the Swindon hospital, he was transferred to the Royal Brompton on September 26.  
Mrs Halim, 44, recalled her husband's last day, when he was surrounded at his bedside by her and their four children; Zara, 13, Adam, 12, Zain, 11 and Alisa, five. Dr Halim's brother, sister and mother were also with him.
His heartbroken widow went on through tears: 'I held him in my arms and whispered prayers and love. We have lost our hero. He was an incredible husband, father and son. He was a best friend to the whole family.
'We all feel empty and I'm not coping. He was my life, my world, my everything. Nothing could have prepared us for this.'
She recalled how her children had decorated his hospital room and spoke to him every day, either during visits or video calls at Swindon and in London.
She said: 'I was convinced that our love would pull him through. And even when he was in hospital, he was being his happy, loving self. 
'He would play chess via video calls with our son and even dealt with work matters.'
Despite the dangers of working on the Covid frontline, Mrs Halim insisted she never tried to stop her husband, even though they had four young children.
She said: 'He was an incredibly gifted and dedicated doctor, right up until the very end. He always put his patients first and continued to support them after their treatment.
'Sometimes I would get very frustrated because it always felt as if he was in the hospital or working on medial matters.
'But he was a compassionate, caring man who made a real difference to people's lives. 
'I never tried to stop him from working with Covid patients because that was his life; caring for people.'
She said she met Dr Halim in 2003 at an ice-skating rink, where he was her instructor before moving into medicine.
She said: 'I met my best friend and that was the person I went on to marry. The 18 years we were together were the best of my life and I will cherish them forever. 
'The world has lost an incredibly caring human being.'
The couple married in 2006, with them going on to have four children, which Mrs Halim home schooled with her husband's help.
In an emotional Facebook post this week, Dr Irfan Halim's business partner Hash Syed paid tribute to his 'dearest friend', who he described as a 'man of many talents'.
He added: 'Most importantly, a loving father and husband and great friend.'
Dr Halim qualified from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals Medical School in 2000 with prizes and distinctions. 
He trained in general surgery with sub specialisation in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. 
Dr Halim qualified from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals Medical School in 2000 with prizes and distinctions.
He trained in general surgery with sub specialisation in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery on the North Thames Higher Surgical Rotation.
The medic completed his specialist training in GI surgery at UCL Hospitals, with additional specialist training in cancer surgery at the Royal Marsden Hospital. He won numerous awards and in 2014 became fellow to the Royal College of Surgeons England.
He was also qualified in law and has a master's in surgical technology from Imperial College London as well as an MBA from the US. He previously worked as an NHS consultant surgeon at West Hertfordshire NHS Hospitals Trust and the North East London NHS Treatment Centre from 2016.
Dr Halim moved into full-time private practice and worked on day case procedures including gallbladder, hernia surgeries and cosmetic skin procedures.
During the pandemic he was shuffled on to the wards to help battle the virus and save lives at Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire.

He had one of the highest volume practices in Britain, with about 300 new patients arriving monthly and him operating on more than 1,200 people.
Mrs Halim said earlier online: 'Irfan you gave me fifteen magical years as your wife, four beautiful children, wonderful memories that will last me until my remaining days in this world.
'You gave 25 dedicated years service to the NHS working as a Consultant General Surgeon. Irfan you were not only my best friend but a best friend to all our children and so many others.'
A former colleague added: 'Being a fighter, he never gave up. He kept believing he would recover. He didn't smoke or drink and was someone who just helped people all the time.'
A GoFundMe page set up in Dr Halim's memory with Mrs Halim revealing that the money raised will be used to support a number of charities he was involved in.
She said: 'This money is not for our family because Irfan has taken care of our financial position. He helped a lot of charities while he was alive, and we want his legacy to live on by raising funds for them in his name.'
The GoFundMe says: 'This fund has been set up for the family of Dr Irfan Halim, a wonderful talented and incredible NHS Doctor who worked hard to help others. 
In an emotional Facebook post this week, Dr Irfan Halim's business partner Hash Syed said:
'Sometimes we meet people who because of their magic, have a profound impact on us. Today, I want to thank Dr. Irfan Halim.
'Late in the summer, Irfan and I met on Y Combinator founders network with a dream to help the billions around the world lead a happier life through a healthier gut Entero Health.
'We connected at around 22.00 one night via LinkedIn and video chatted till 2.00 in the morning.
'We worked on our idea to solve for functional gut disorders and then pitched it to startup accelerator Antler VC where it was gladly accepted.
'Within the space of 6 weeks, we’d identified the problem, refined the narrative, go-to-market plan ready and were days inches away from pitching for funding.
'Most importantly we were excited about embarking on a game changing journey together to solve a huge problem.
'Having served as a Consultant General Surgeon for over 20 years treating over 250,000 patients, Dr Irfan collapsed whilst performing surgery on Friday September 10 and it was confirmed he had a severe case of COVID.
'He was admitted to hospital and had to undergo ECMO. Being a fighter, he never gave up. He kept believing he would recover.
'With his wife, four children, family and friends all praying for him throughout, he kept fighting.
'Unfortunately, my dearest friend who spent his life in the service of others, sadly passed away late on Sunday November 14.
'I will cherish the fun we had building Entero at the Antler hub near Liverpool Street. Whether it be you riding around on your scooter, or our favourite burger bar.
'You were the definition of service to others, and believing in more.
'A man of many talents across being a doctor, a pilot and a lawyer. Most importantly, loving father and husband and great friend.
'Our energy, our dream, our goal to help people lead healthier lives won’t go to waste. 
'Thank you my friend, Dr Irfan Halim for everything.'
'Irfan was dearly loved and touched so many peoples lives. Sadly, he was taken far too soon from those who love him.
'Not only was he a loving husband, a devoted father of four young beautiful children, but an incredibly awesome human being to all that were blessed to have met him.
'He spent four months away from his family at the height of the pandemic, working in the covid wards. Irfan and the NHS worked frantically to bring him home to his beautiful family, but tragically he passed away after a nine week fight against Covid.
'We have set up this fund as close friends and family to ease the burden of losing Irfan. Irfan was the sole breadwinner for his family. May Irfan's memory be a blessing to all who met and loved him.'
His death comes as Britain braces for another winter battling coronavirus, with death and cases data becoming increasingly hard to predict.
Infections have increased week-on-week on seven of the previous eight days, following the return of schools from half-term at the start of the month.
There were also 199 coronavirus deaths registered yesterday, marking a two per cent increase on last week's toll. Latest hospital data shows there were 799 admissions on November 14, down 9 per cent in a week.
The Government has not put a threshold on the number of daily hospital admissions it is willing to tolerate before rolling back restrictions.
But one of its top scientific advisers, 'Professor Lockdown' Neil Ferguson suggested last month that figure could be 1,200.
Meanwhile Britain's largest symptom-tracking study found the number of people falling ill with the virus every week fell by a tenth last week.
Professor Tim Spector, the eminent King's College London scientist who runs the study, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' restrictions will not be needed.
Fears of Christmas curbs were raised this week when Boris Johnson admitted the draconian action was not off the cards.
The PM pointed to infection across Europe, which have sent nations back into lockdowns, as a sign of what could happen here.
Professor Spector said: 'In terms of what it means for Christmas, I'm cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. It's becoming clear that children and the school holidays play a key role in the waves of infection.
'I think it's safe to say that we can expect to see another rise in the new year after the holidays.' But he still called on all Britons to get fully vaccinated against the virus, as well as ensuring they have their booster doses.
And he urged everyone to start using face masks in crowded spaces such as public transport. This was a softening of his tone from barely three weeks ago when he warned ministers should consider Plan B.
Professor Spector's symptom study relies on daily reports from more than 750,000 Britons on whether they are feeling unwell and if they test positive for Covid.
It is based on self-reporting and dose not ask participants to give evidence of their symptoms. The latest estimates used 40,000 tests for the virus over the fortnight to November 13.
PM Mr Johnson said earlier this week that it still was not possible to rule out some Covid restrictions being reimposed.
He said: 'Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to — non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions — get the boosters.'
But he added there was still nothing in the data to suggest further restrictions were needed. Scientists fear further Covid measures may be needed if a new variant emerges that is more transmissible and better able to dodge vaccine-triggered immunity.
Last winter the Kent 'Alpha' variant triggered a spike in Covid cases, leading to Christmas day plans being thrust into chaos at the last minute.

45,"A former party girl has revealed how converting to Islam 'bettered her character' and saved her from a 'dark place' after her hedonistic lifestyle left her feeling suicidal. 
Persephone Rizvi, 27, from Huddersfield, told how she used to spend her weekends getting into fights, drinking until 5am and waking up with a hangover before converting to Islam seven years ago. 
Speaking on BBC Three documentary This Girl's Changed, Persephone, who now wears a hijab, said everything from her fashion sense to the way she acts has changed as a result of finding Islam. 
'Whether it was the words I used or the attitude, I had a big ego', she admitted. 'Islam has bettered me in terms of my character, the way I speak to people. I don't backbite and gossip, all these things Islam has taught me.'
Persephone described how her weekends used to be a blur of parties with friends. 
'In my peak party life a weekend would have started for me with ""Whose idea are we using, what outfit am I wearing, what's my fit going to be, what heels am I going to wear"",' she said.
'Then it would be pre-drinks, then it would be ""who is taking us to town?"" Literally the party wouldn't stop until 4 or 5am in the club and then it would be a house party and waking up in the morning with a hangover and that was literally my weekend.' 
She recalled one occasion when she was 'really drunk lying naked on the kitchen floor' and said 'I can no longer do this, this is not what's meant for me'. 
At one point in the programme Persephone returned to a park where she had previously tried to end her life. 
'I didn't even see it coming,' she said. 'When I [last] came here my mental health was really bad. I tried to end my life. I can't believe it when I think back, what could have made me be that hurt. 
'This was the starting point of my mental health being on the decline. Islam has helped me massively in terms of my mental health, just that knowledge that you can find a way through things.' 
Persephone's parents have been supportive of her journey into Islam, and the documentary saw her speaking with her mum and dad about when her mental health was at its lowest. 
Her mother recalled: 'You were just on a downward spiral. I actually at times, I didn't think you were going to make it. We had concerns for you, we thought you might do something.'
She added: 'This is what my concerns were, you didn't want to speak about anything really. But you used to write [diaries]. I used to read them. 
'I used to make sure you had lots of greasy body lotion so I could get into your phone, I used to read your chats and you were in a very dark place.'
After discovering Islam, Persephone threw away bags of her clothes she no longer felt were appropriate, removed her false nails, changed her name on Facebook and deleted all her racy pictures. 
'I think for me it was pretty much about looking for answers,' she said of her decision to convert. 
'I saw no purpose or value in myself, I started fasting with a friend in a call centre and I'd actually done Ramadan twice before I became Muslim. 
'The feeling was immense at the end of the day, she gave me that first real feeling of Islam and gratefulness and peace that finally made me say I finally need to take my Shahada now [Islamic oath].'
She ghosted her friends because she thought it would be too difficult to be around people drinking alcohol and eventually moved to London followed by Manchester before moving back home at 27.   
'When I converted I cut them off, like if you're not Muslim we can't be friends. But now I know more what I believe and I know it's not that,' she said.
'I literally dropped off the face of social media changed my whole religion converted to Islam and expected them to wanna meet up, wanna catch up with me and reintegrate into my life and let me into theirs.  Am I asking too much of them? I don't know.'
The four friends Persephone met up with were all accepting of her change of religion, and reflecting on her journey she said that she felt she could 'be herself and accept herself'.

46,"A 21-year-old killer is facing life behind bars after pleading guilty today to murdering a mother of two who he grabbed off the street as she was leaving a hospital appointment before strangling and beating her to death. 
Valentin Lazar, 21 - who was pictured in a mugshot released this afternoon - inflicted multiple injuries on 45-year-old Maria Rawlings before leaving her in undergrowth in Romford. Ms Rawlings was attacked after visiting accident and emergency following a fall.
Having left hospital without being seen, she got on a bus in Romford just after 11pm on May 3, where her path crossed with Lazar. The mother of two had only been on the bus for about 10 minutes when it terminated and she and the defendant got off.
Lazar was caught on CCTV as he guided his victim towards some shrubbery. After about 30 minutes, he emerged from the undergrowth alone carrying her handbag, the Old Bailey had heard.
Prosecutor Paul Jarvis had told a previous hearing that Ms Rawlings was targeted by Lazar because she was a vulnerable woman alone at night.
He said: 'He was probably carrying a knife.
'He led her into the bushes before violently attacking her and ultimately killing her before stealing some of her belongings and walking off.'
After the attack, Lazar boarded a bus towards Dagenham, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
Ms Rawlings' naked body was found concealed in undergrowth by a dog walker at about 2.30pm the next day in the Little Heath area.
She had suffered multiple injuries to her mouth, chest and knee as well as 13 fractured ribs but there were no signs of sexual assault.
A baseball cap with the defendant's DNA on it was left near to the body.
Following a media appeal, Lazar, who was living in rented accommodation in East Ham, was identified on social media.
On his arrest, officers found clothes matching those of the attacker with traces of blood on them.
On Friday, Ms Rawlings' two grown-up daughters sat in court as the defendant pleaded guilty to murder with the assistance of a Romanian interpreter.
The court was told that he admitted murder but denied he intended to kill Ms Rawlings or that he had a knife.
Remanding the defendant into custody, Judge Peter Rook QC said: 'You have pleaded guilty to murder in a case of the utmost seriousness.
'There is only one sentence the court can pass and that is one of life imprisonment. A judge will decide the minimum that you must serve.'
The case was adjourned until January 10 next year.
Emma Currie, from the CPS, said: 'Maria Rawlings was a vulnerable woman. She had attended A&E on the night of her murder, but tragically left before she was seen.
'The prosecution case included DNA and footprint evidence as well as CCTV footage which caught Lazar leaving with the handbag Ms Rawlings had been wearing earlier that evening.
'Valentin Lazar is a violent man who has shown little remorse for his actions.
'When initially arrested he even claimed to suffer from memory loss, saying 'I can't remember what happened yesterday'.
'Women should be free to travel through London without fearing violent attacks.
'The CPS is committed to bringing offenders to justice in respect of violence against women and girls. I hope this conviction provides some sense of justice for the family and friends of Ms Rawlings. Our thoughts remain with them at this time.'
The murder of Ms Rawlings comes amid heightened concern for the safety of lone women following a spate of predatory stranger attacks.",-2
47,"Crime and victim campaigners have savaged the Met Police's new 44-question handcuff policy, calling it 'embarrassing' and treating trained police officers like children'.
The Centre for Crime Prevention said crooks would not give PCc the luxury of the time to mull over the near-50 considerations in the guidance.
And it suggested the document would raise yet more of its own questions - but this time about the leadership of under-fire Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick. 
David Spencer, research director at the centre, told MailOnline: 'Plenty of people are of the view that police priorities tend to be the wellbeing of criminals rather than the law abiding public and this will go some way to reinforce that perception.
'It is also quite simply treating trained police officers like children and is hugely patronising to the vast majority of police officers who are arresting potentially dangerous suspects every single day.
'Most arrests will not give police the luxury of considering 44 questions before apprehending a suspect. They are working on instinct and applying their training and this is where such questions should be, and are, drummed into them.
'It is difficult to imagine how Cressida Dick’s time as Commissioner could get much more embarrassing for the Met, but this policy is certainly doing its best. 
'There are already serious question marks about whether Cressida Dick is the right person to be leading the Met and proclamations like this are only going to undermine her authority still further.' 
The policy on handcuffing tells officers to ask themselves 44 questions before arresting a suspect and details the procedure in a child-style ABC guide. 
Its mammoth decision process is laid out in full in the new 25-page document published by Scotland Yard.
It puts into official policy nearly 50 questions officers should consider when they are using the police-issue restraints.
The questions include, 'What could go wrong (and what could go well)?', 'What is happening?', and, 'What do I not know?'.
Other advice to mull over also includes, 'Do I need to take action immediately?' and 'What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?' 
Most are from the College of Policing's National Decision Model but are now enshrined in the official equipment policy. 
It is not clear what the Met's previous policy on the police restraint tactic had been.
But the new rules have been drawn up after complaints from the black community they had been disproportionately targeted in stop and search.  
1. Is what I am considering consistent with the Code of Ethics?
2. What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?
3. What does the police service expect of me in this situation?
4. Is this action or decision likely to reflect positively on my professionalism and policing generally?
5. Could I explain my action or decision in public?
6. What is happening?
7. What do I know so far?
8. What do I not know?
9. What further information (or intelligence) do I want/need at this moment?
10. Do I need to take action immediately?
11. Do I need to seek more information?
12. What could go wrong (and what could go well)?
13. What is causing the situation?
14. How probable is the risk of harm?
15. How serious would it be?
16. Is that level of risk acceptable?
17. Is this a situation for the police alone to deal with?
18. Am I the appropriate person to deal with this?
19. What am I trying to achieve?
20. Will my action resolve the situation?
21. What police powers might be required?
22. Is there any national guidance covering this type of situation?
23. Do any local organisational policies or guidelines apply?
24. What legislation might apply?
25. Is there any research evidence?
26. If decision makers have to account for their decisions, will they be able to say they were proportionate, legitimate, necessary and ethical?
27. Reasonable in the circumstances facing them at the time? 
28. Does anyone else need to know what you have decided?
29. What happened as a result of your decision?
30. Was it what you wanted or expected to happen? 
31. How were the principles and standards of professional behaviour demonstrated during the situation?
32. What information or intelligence was available?
33. What factors (potential benefits and harms) were assessed?
34. What threat and risk assessment methods were used (if any)?
35. Was a working strategy developed and was it appropriate?
36. Were there any powers, policies and legislation that should have been considered? 
37. If policy was not followed, was this reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances?

Also featured is an alphabet-themed guide to handcuffing that warns to, 'Always ask the suspect if the cuffs are too tight'.
It includes the advice to 'always double-lock the handcuffs'. 
The Met publicised the new policy yesterday morning, which came after a review by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist. 
Industry insiders and former police officers have slammed the alphabet-style guide, with former Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley warning it was indicative of the 'weakness of senior police leadership'.
He told GB News: 'Frankly, it's an example of the ineptitude, the pusillanimous, the weakness of decision-making that we now see with senior police leadership.
'Police officers, when they decide to use force or apply handcuffs, need to run through in their mind a lot of different things which comes down to: ""Is this the right thing to be doing, and can I defend my options?""
 'What we've now see happen is something that's going to affect three groups of people. 
'First, it is going to put off the cops using force or arresting people. There's nothing more difficult than trying to get some officers to deal with confrontation.
'It's very easy to back down. The hard thing is to motivate a police officer to be nosy. 
'The second thing is, the public are going to think: ""What on earth is going on here?""
'The third point really is that those who are ""baddies"", it's going to give them an opportunity for an outer.'  
Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said of the force's new policy: 'My number one priority remains tackling violent crime and keeping people safe from street crime – which is blighting the lives of too many young people.
'Alongside that, I have set out to increase the trust and confidence of communities in their police service.
'We know that not all communities have the same level of trust in us – I am determined to change that.
'The handcuffing review could not have taken place effectively without the input and contribution of many front line police officers and members of the public. I thank them all for their time, effort and valuable honesty.' 
The policy follows a review commissioned by the Met Commissioner Cressida Dick in 2019 into the use of handcuffs before an arrest has taken place.
It came after complaints from black communities they were being disproportionately targeted.
The Met said the review would make sure the tactic, for which there is a sound legal basis in some circumstances, was justified and recorded on each occasion.
It fed in consultation responses from young black men aged between 16 to 25 years-old.
A Met spokeswoman said: 'The launch of the policy, which covers all aspects of the use of handcuffs, is the final recommendation from the 2020 review to be implemented.
'Officers are already receiving additional legal training, more public and personal safety training, with further emphasis on de-escalation; and more community input to understand the respective experiences of the public and police officers during encounters on the streets of London.' 
Last October a highly criticial review of the Met's use of stop and search powers has revealed officers stopped two black men after they were seen 'fist bumping,'.
The review by the Independent Office for Police Conduct revealed the officers thought the pair had just completed a drug deal, in one of a number of issues raised by the watchdog.
It found handcuffs were used in nearly all instances where other tactics could have de-escalated an encounter, while officers also failed to use bodycam video from the outset of their interaction with some members of the public.
The IOPC said their review 'mirrors concerns,' already raised by communities in the Capital.
Regional director Sal Naseem said: 'We saw a lack of understanding from officers about why their actions were perceived to be discriminatory.'",-2
48,"Andrew Marr today revealed he was leaving the BBC after 21 years, including 16 years fronting his Sunday morning political programme - and will join LBC and Classic FM.
The 62-year-old said he was 'keen to get my own voice back' and would now focus on presenting political and cultural radio shows and writing for newspapers.
Father-of-three Marr, who is married to fellow political journalist Jackie Ashley, 67, and earns up to £339,999 a year at the BBC, added that leaving to join LBC's owners Global would give him 'a new freedom' to do journalism with 'no filter'. 
MailOnline understands that Global will be paying Marr at least £500,000 a year for his new role, although the Leicester Square-based network refused to confirm this. 
Industry experts said LBC would be a 'great home for Andrew as he won't have to abide by the BBC's strict impartiality rules'. It comes after Marr hinted in May that he may be leaving the BBC because of 'not being able to speak in your own voice'.
The Glasgow-born veteran broadcaster joined the BBC in May 2000 as political editor and later spent 16 years at the helm of his own Sunday morning show. 
Global said Marr will be presenting new shows on LBC and Classic FM, a new weekly podcast on Global Player, and will also write a regular column for LBC's website. 
His exit comes as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg is said to be in discussions about leaving her role to become a presenter on Radio 4's Today programme.
Jon Sopel is the 6/4 favourite to replace her, with previous political editors such as Marr and Nick Robinson having moved on to other presenting jobs at the BBC.
This week Sarah Smith was made the BBC's new North America editor, taking over from Sopel, and Marr's departure suggests the staffing movements could continue. 
Marr tweeted today: 'Personal announcement. After 21 years, I have decided to move on from the BBC. l leave behind many happy memories and wonderful colleagues. 
'But from the New Year I am moving to Global to write and present political and cultural shows, and to write for newspapers.
'I think British politics and public life are going to go through an even more turbulent decade, and as I've said, I am keen to get my own voice back.
Andrew William Stevenson Marr was born in Glasgow in 1959 and was privately educated in Scotland before gaining a first-class English degree at Cambridge University.
His media career began in 1981 when he joined The Scotsman as a trainee reporter, and in 1984 he moved to London where he worked as a parliamentary correspondent for the newspaper, before becoming a political correspondent.
He joined The Independent in 1986 as a member of the new newspaper's launch staff before leaving for The Economist, where he ultimately became its political editor.
Marr returned to The Independent as the newspaper's political editor in 1992, and became its editor in 1996, where he oversaw radical changes in its format in a bid to halt a decline in readership figures.
He left in early 1998, with some reports suggesting he was sacked, and took roles at different papers before arriving at the BBC as political editor in May 2000. It was a position he held until 2005 when he began presenting The Andrew Marr Show which has become the most important political television show of the week.
He also presents Radio 4's Start the Week and has written more than a dozen books, including the History of Modern Britain.
Marr is married to political journalist Jackie Ashley, 67, with whom he has a son and two daughters – and he also has a love of painting.
In 2008 he took out a super-injunction to suppress reports of a relationship with a fellow journalist five years earlier.
At the time, he believed he had fathered a child with the woman. He also made maintenance payments – until he discovered through a DNA test that he was not the girl's father.
The affair, which ended in 2003, was common knowledge at Westminster and within the BBC, but the injunction banned publication of his name in connection with the story.
Marr later admitted he was 'embarrassed' about resorting to legal action, saying: 'I did not come into journalism to go around gagging journalists.'
Then in 2012 he was photographed putting his hand down the trousers of an unnamed female colleague during an intimate late-night clinch in a Soho back alley.
After the pictures emerged, he said: 'I am really embarrassed and so annoyed with myself. It was just a goodbye clinch. It had been a long drunken evening and it was just a silly thing.'
The veteran broadcaster, who lives in Primrose Hill, North London, has suffered a number of health scares over the past decade.
Marr was taken to hospital in January 2013 after suffering the stroke at home but returned to host his show later that year. In 2018, he declared 'it's good to be back' after undergoing an operation to have a cancerous tumour removed from his kidney.
In June he contracted Covid despite being double vaccinated and felt 'seriously ill' but had fully recovered by the end of his quarantine period.
'I have been doing the Andrew Marr show every Sunday morning for 16 years now and that is probably more than enough time for anybody!'
In a statement released by Global, Marr added: 'Coming to Global gives me a new freedom - to do fast-paced, very regular political journalism on LBC with no filter, in entirely my own voice. 
'On Classic FM, I'll be exploring my love of classical music, and culture generally, with some surprising guests. I feel I'm joining a young, hungrily ambitious and exciting company and I can't wait to get stuck in.' 
Marr received an annual salary from the BBC of up to £339,999 in the 2020/2021 year for his work on The Andrew Marr Show, Radio 4's Start the Week, documentaries for BBC One and election night.
This was down from a salary of up to £364,999 in 2019/2020, and up to £394,999 in 2018/2019.
Addressing Andrew Marr's departure from the BBC, its director-general Tim Davie said in a statement: 'Andrew Marr has been a brilliant journalist and presenter during his time at the BBC.
'He leaves an unmatched legacy of outstanding political interviews and landmark programmes. We wish him well for the next chapter.'
Other BBC colleagues including Newsnight policy editor Lewis Goodall were among those congratulating Marr on his lengthy career at the corporation.
Goodall wrote: 'What a huge loss to the BBC Andrew but what an incredible contribution over so long. Best of luck with the new gig.'
And Fran Unsworth, the BBC's outgoing director of news and current affairs, said: 'Throughout his long and distinguished career at the BBC, Andrew has been a firm favourite with our audiences.
'Andrew started at the BBC as a knowledgeable and insightful political editor and went on to become a feature of the UK's Sunday mornings, on Sunday AM, which became the Andrew Marr Show. He is a fantastic presenter and interviewer, whose wisdom and skill will be a loss to our screens.
'We thank him greatly for his years of service and wish him the best of luck in his new role.'
Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid added: 'Congratulations on the new role but this is a huge blow for the BBC and for those of us who rely on The Andrew Marr Show to set us up for the week ahead. Wishing the very best, to the best.' 
Sky News political editor Beth Rigby said: 'Sunday mornings won’t be the same without you on my telly. But very best of luck in your next chapter.' 
And his new LBC colleague Eddie Mair joked: 'It turns out that three years ago Global wanted to hire Marr but because of a typo they got me by mistake.' 
Global said his new 'opinion-led programme' on LBC will be 'fully visualized' on Global Player and he will 'give his view on the biggest issues of the moment, along with agenda-setting guests'.
The company said he was joining Britain's biggest commercial news talk station which has posted its highest ever listening figures, with more than three million people now tuning in across the UK each week. 
Radio industry consultant Paul Chantler told MailOnline today: 'Andrew Marr is a major signing for Global and will further enhance respect and credibility for LBC in particular. 
'LBC is going from strength to strength and now has a stellar lineup of presenters. It's a great home for Andrew as he won't have to abide by the BBC's strict impartiality rules. 
'At LBC, he will be allowed to express his own opinions and undertake interviews with attitude as impartiality is achieved across the output as a whole not just within a single programme. LBC will certainly allow him to find his own voice again.' 
Marr will also present a new programme on Classic FM, playing music and interviewing guests from the world of politics and arts. 
Andrew Marr's Sunday morning programme on BBC One has been appointment television for those in the Westminster bubble, as well as its keen observers. His departure from the corporation leaves a vacancy in one of the most high profile jobs in political journalism. Here are some of the contenders to replace him:
Laura Kuenssberg
The BBC's political editor is likely to be among the frontrunners for the job.
It was previously reported Kuenssberg is negotiating stepping away from her role of the past six years to join the Today programme as part of a major reshuffle of the BBC's on-air staff.
Zeinab Badawi
The presenter of BBC Global Questions and HardTalk has hosted Marr's show before so would be a familiar face to his regular viewers. She is bookmaker Coral's favourite to take over, with odds of 2-1.
Emily Maitlis
The presenter of Newsnight has won acclaim for her high profile interviews with the Duke of York, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton and would be a sparring partner to be reckoned with when sitting down with political leaders.
Andrew Neil
It has been mooted that the former long-time BBC presenter could return to the fold after he stepped down from his roles as the chairman and host of a prime-time show on GB News.
Neil has since said it was a 'huge mistake' for him to become the face of the fledgling channel and hinted he is keen for another job in TV, saying: 'I don't want GB News to be the full stop in my broadcasting career.
Nick Robinson
The former BBC political editor, who has filled in for Marr before, is currently a presenter of both BBC Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Political Thinking.
Clive Myrie
A regular presenter of BBC News At Six and Ten since 2010, the broadcaster has previously worked as the broadcaster's correspondent in Asia, Africa, Washington, Paris and Brussels.
Earlier this year he replaced John Humphrys as the host of Mastermind, when the veteran journalist stepped down after 18 years in the role.
Victoria Derbyshire
The award-winning broadcaster has presented some of the BBC's biggest programmes, including Newsnight and Panorama, and fronted her own current affairs show.
When plans to axe her self-titled BBC Two programme were leaked, the host said she was 'absolutely devastated'.
She was introduced to a whole new audience when she competed on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! last year.
Amol Rajan
The BBC's media editor is a presenter of the prestigious Today programme on Radio 4, as well as Start The Week.
He is also a restaurant critic and makes regular appearances on television as a guest on the judging panel of MasterChef.
Sophie Raworth
The BBC newsreader, who has also covered for Marr in the past, is one of the main presenters of the BBC News At Six and Ten. She has also presented election night coverage, as well as Watchdog, Crimewatch and coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show.
In May, Marr was interviewed at Aye Write, Glasgow's book festival, and was asked whether he ever felt 'a desperate urge to come out of the closet' over his political views, replying: 'Yes, absolutely.'
The Times reported at the time that Marr refused to say anything else about his personal political views, saying: 'I cannot tell you now because I will lose my job.' 
Marr added: 'There are many privileges of working at the BBC, including the size of the audience and all of that, but the biggest single frustration by far is losing your own voice, not being able to speak in your own voice.
'What I could say safely is that I think we are going to go through a period of politics — the next ten or 20 years — much more turbulent and much more interesting and testing and challenging then anything we have seen in the last ten years, which have been big enough. 
'I think it will be very, very hard for people like me to carry on being completely neutral and completely sotto voce all the way through that. At some point, I want to get out and use my own voice again.'
Ashley Tabor-King, founder and executive president of Global, said: 'Andrew is one of the finest and most respected broadcasters and journalists of our time and we are honored to welcome him to the Global family, especially at a moment when we are celebrating record audience figures.
'LBC now takes its next step. Andrew Marr will be an unmissable moment in the schedule and we are excited that he will be part of LBC and Classic FM's incredible presenter line-up.'  
Marr will join a host of other presenters at LBC including Nick Ferrari, James O'Brien, Eddie Mair, Shelagh Fogarty, Iain Dale, David Lammy, Camilla Tominey and Matt Frei.
He will also join the likes Alexander Armstrong, Moira Stuart, John Suchet, Myleene Klass, Margherita Taylor, Bill Turnbull, Alan Titchmarsh, John Humphrys and Charlotte Hawkins at Classic FM. 
James Rea, director of broadcasting and content at Global, said: 'It is fantastic to welcome a broadcaster of Andrew's calibre to Global. 
'We are looking forward to him bringing his sharp, political insight to LBC at such an exciting time for the station and his passion for classical music and the arts to Classic FM. I know that our audience will enjoy listening and interacting with him from next year.'
Marr has hosted the BBC's flagship political programme, The Andrew Marr Show, for the past 16 years and regularly presents on BBC Radio 4.
He is also a documentary-maker and author, having written more than a dozen books.
It comes just nine days after veteran broadcaster Adam Boulton, who is the same age at 62, said he would leave Sky News following more than 30 years after saying that there is a 'move against the Baby Boomers' in the TV world.
Having joined the channel as political editor for its launch in 1989, the 62-year-old public school-educated Oxford graduate has served as editor-at-large since 2014.
Mr Boulton's departure was said to have been a mutual decision, although he said in an exit interview that television was now 'very sensitive to the idea of diversity'.
Speaking about his fellow veteran Sky broadcasters Dermot Murnaghan, 63, and Kay Burley, 60, Mr Boulton told The Times: 'We've had our day.' 
The announcement of his departure came after John Ryley, the head of Sky News, said TV was moving away from the era of the 'all-powerful anchor'.
And it was announced just seven months after his fellow veteran broadcaster Jon Snow said he would leave Channel 4 News at the end of this year.
The 73-year-old, who has spent 32 years as the show's anchor, said he felt it was 'time to move on'. However, he will continue to front future 'longer-form projects' for Channel 4.
Earlier this week Sarah Smith was appointed as the BBC's new North America editor.
The 52-year-old, who became the broadcaster's first ever Scotland editor in 2014, takes over from Jon Sopel who left the post last month after seven years.
Prior to this, she was based in the US working for Channel 4 and helped cover big American news stories such as the 2008 presidential election and the global financial crash.
Smith is also a regular host on BBC programmes including the Today programme and Newsnight. She began her journalistic career as a trainee at BBC Scotland.
Her father was former Labour leader John Smith, who served as party leader from July 1992 until his death from a heart attack in May 1994. 
The Archbishop of York cut up his dog collar during The Andrew Marr Show in December 2007 in protest over Robert Mugabe's rule of Zimbabwe.
Dr John Sentamu said he would refuse to wear the Anglican symbol of office until Mugabe was no longer in power.
His demonstration followed Mugabe's controversial presence at the EU summit with African leaders in Lisbon
The archbishop criticised African leaders who rallied round Mugabe and defended him as a freedom fighter who liberated his country from white rule.
Speaking on Marr's programme, Dr Sentamu took off his dog collar, saying: 'As an Anglican this is what I wear to identify myself, that I'm a clergyman.'
He then took out a pair of scissors before snipping away at the dog collar, adding: 'Do you know what Mugabe has done? 
'He has taken people's identity and literally, if you don't mind, cut it to pieces.
'So, as far as I am concerned, from now on I am not going to wear a dog collar until Mugabe is gone.'
In November 2017, he put the dog collar back on, again on The Andrew Marr Show, after Mr Mugabe left office following 37 years of authoritarian rule.
David Cameron was told to 'shut up' by broadcaster Andrew Marr while appearing on his BBC programme in April 2014.
As the show drew to a close, the then-prime minister tried to speak about the schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria by the Boko Haram Islamist group.
But footage published online shows Marr appearing to say: 'I, I…Prime Minister shut up I'm afraid. I'm really, really sorry, we have run out of time.'
However, Mr Cameron did not appear to be angered by the interruption and quickly replied to Marr: 'I've gone on, sorry.'
Andrew Marr faced criticism for his interview with Boris Johnson in October last year, which led to the BBC having to defend him as 'duly impartial'.
The interview, which was said to have left 10 Downing Street furious, saw him interrupt the Prime Minister and claimed he was not telling the truth about wage growth in Britain.
Mr Johnson argued during the programme: 'After more than 10 years of flatlining, what you're seeing is people with low incomes being paid more.'
But Mr Marr retorted: 'You've said something that isn't true, I'm afraid. The Office of National Statistics (ONS), your own body, says that wages are not keeping pace with inflation. So, in real terms, over the last three months, wages have gone down, not up.'
LBC radio presenter Iain Dale later praised Marr as an impartial interrogator, but Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she would 'argue otherwise'.
In a response to viewer complaints, the BBC said: 'There were many issues covered in the interview with the prime minister, such as violence against women, the HGV driver shortage and the national insurance tax rise, and so it was imperative for Mr Marr to keep the conversation on track in order to have time for them all. Sometimes Mr Marr repeated his question to press the prime minister into giving a clear answer for the audience.
'Mr Johnson is no stranger to robust and challenging interviews and we consider it is appropriate to hold the leader of the nation to account on different issues. However, we're satisfied that Mr Marr questioned Mr Johnson in a fair, duly impartial and professional manner.'",-2
49,"The wife of former French international Eric Abidal is seeking a divorce after learning of his alleged relationship with Paris Saint-Germain women's footballer Kheira Hamraoui.
The links emerged as investigators try to learn who was behind a mysterious attack against Hamraoui this month, when her legs were beaten after she was dragged out of a car with her team-mate Aminata Diallo.
Earlier this week, Hamraoui appealed to the media to respect her privacy after police discovered she was using a telephone SIM card registered in Abidal's name on the night of the attack.
'Hayet Abidal is going to file a divorce request in Barcelona,' her lawyers said in a statement.
Eric Abidal, a household name in France, was Barcelona's sporting director from 2018 to 2020, during which time Hamraoui was with the women's team.
The statement claimed that he 'admitted to his spouse' having an affair with Hamraoui after French prosecutors in the Paris suburb of Versailles announced the SIM card link.
Hayet Abidal 'reiterates her request to be questioned very soon on a case that has already had several collateral victims,' the statement added.
The Abidals, who know each other from their native Lyon in southeast France, have been married since 2007 and have four daughters and a son.
Diallo, who was not injured in the attack, was held for questioning for nearly 35 hours last week before being released without charge.
The attack and its aftermath sent shockwaves through the PSG club, with the two players considered friendly rivals for midfield positions.
Hamraoui was left out of the squad in PSG's 2-0 defeat of Real Madrid on Thursday, which saw them clinch their place in the quarter-finals of the Women's Champions League.
Hamraoui, 31, was beaten with an iron bar, leaving her with a number of bruises and cuts on her legs which required stitches. 
French sports paper L'Equipe have released details from the police on how the attack took place, detailing how Diallo drove Hamraoui to and from a team meal in a Toyota Corolla provided by the club, dropping off another player afterwards - Sakina Karchaoui - before the attack began in Chatou, Yvelines.
'My attacker hit me with an iron bar several times. I saw that he was mainly targeting my legs and I was trying to protect myself with my hands,' Hamraoui told police.  
'At that time, I didn't see a weapon. They immediately start yelling: ""Open the door! Open the door!"" The one on my side grabbed me and pulled me out of the vehicle. 
'Before, he grabbed a rectangular iron bar that he had hidden in his pants or under his sweater.
'He gave me a first blow from the first moments of the assault to force me out of the cabin. I fell on the road and then on the right side of the road. 
'My attacker hit me with an iron bar several times. I saw that he was mainly targeting my legs and I was trying to protect myself with my hands.
'The scene lasted several minutes, it seemed long to me. Aminata told me it was faster. I think the two individuals fled because cars were coming into the street. 
'They started running in the direction of the traffic. We quickly lost sight of them. I think a car should be waiting for them nearby.'
Hamraoui also refers to hearing the term 'you like to sleep with married men' during the assault, a detail confirmed by Diallo who was being 'detained' by the second stranger throughout the attack.  
After sustaining serious injuries, she was taken to hospital and has been told to stay off work for three weeks but she has reportedly resumed individual training - yet is being aided by a psychologist and benefits from 'close protection set up by the club.' 
The 42-year-old Abidal has been married to his wife, Hayet Abidal, since 2003 and they have five children together. Le Monde say it is possible she could be called upon as a witness. Abidal's lawyer was contacted and said: 'I have spoken with him, but for now I won’t tell you anything at all.'
Diallo, meanwhile, released a statement this week about the allegations: 'Aminata Diallo deplores the perfectly artificial dramatisation of a rivalry between her and Kheira Hamraoui which would justify her taking it out on her team-mate.
'This theory does not correspond in any way to the true nature of their relationship.
'Other much more serious leads are now being looked at by investigators, which do not implicate my client in any way.
'Aminata Diallo regrets the media uproar which had already sentenced her, with no basis, and she would like to emphasise that she will not hesitate to defend her rights through legal action, if necessary, against all defamation.' ",-2
50,"Until last night, the most nauseous I've felt in my life was after eating a vegan sausage roll live on air, a reckless decision that prompted me to instantly hurl into a large bucket.
But that sickening ordeal paled into vomit-inducing insignificance compared to the comically cringe-worthy collision between the world's two most narcissistic, fake and irritating female celebrities, Meghan Markle and Ellen DeGeneres.
Watching them giggle and preen away during their lengthy cheese-fest, stroking each other's egos and dishing out cash to charity, you'd think they are the kindest, sweetest human beings to ever bestride the globe.
But it's worth reminding ourselves that they both stand accused of being nasty little bullies who, when the cameras aren't around, terrorize their staff.
Unsurprisingly, bullying in the workplace didn't come up as a topic of discussion last night.
Nor did Princess Pinocchio's trashing of the Royal Family and Monarchy, the institutions she professes to detest but milks like a greedy dairy farmer.
Or her treatment of her own family, almost all of whom she's disowned for threatening her relentless climb up the social and financial ladder.
Instead, viewers were treated to a repulsive exchange of faux-humble shmaltz designed to flog copies of Ms. Markle's critically derided, poor-selling children's book The Bench.
To help do so, she released new photographs of her son Archie feeding chickens at her $14.7 million mansion in Santa Barbara and talked about her daughter Lilibet's teething problems.
All of which may come as a surprise to those who'd been conned into thinking Meghan quit Britain, dragging her husband with her, because she craved privacy for her family from the beastly British press.
It turned out she didn't want privacy at all, she just wanted to get away from anyone that might take a negative view of her constant whining and rank hypocrisy.
And of course, she wanted to get away from having to perform the often arduous and unexciting royal duties that go with having a title like the Duchess of Sussex.
Now Meghan has the best of all worlds: she gets to exploit her fancy royal name to make hundreds of millions of dollars, doesn't have to do any work for the institution that bestowed it upon her, is free (in her head) to publicly abuse the royals as a bunch of heartless racists, and can live the life of a fabulously rich celebrity who pops up on TV chat show sofas to promote her brand.
But at what cost does all this come for the Royal Family that she renounced at the same venomous speed she renounced her own father when he didn't toe the line?
The worst thing about her Ellen appearance wasn't even the fact she was going on the show at all given her friend and neighbor's show has been cancelled in the wake of the awful bullying allegations against the host and some of her executives.
That was bad, but then Ellen's no more a real 'friend' of Meghan's than Oprah Winfrey. She's just another famous person with the tools, currently, to inflate the Sussex celebrity brand.
No, the worst thing came when Ellen made Meghan literally dance for her book-plugging supper by taking part in one of the most embarrassing stunts I've ever seen a royal do on television.
The 'Duchess of Sussex', as she so proudly calls herself at every opportunity, pulled a prank on a trio of street vendors, carrying out a series of orders from Ellen via a secret microphone in her ear.
Meghan touched her elbow, and her nose, performed a squat, held a large crystal to her head as she moaned and groaned, and bounced up and down with excitement at seeing a hot sauce for sale as she exclaimed: 'Let mommy have a taste! My boo loves hot sauce!'
She then chomped a sauce-coated chip 'like a chipmunk' because Ellen instructed her to, before telling the salesman: 'That's not spicy! Let me try something real hot, mommy wants some heat! Let's get the spiciest, let's get the hottest!'
Ordered by smirking Ellen to shove another chip whole into her mouth, Meghan did so, and began furiously fanning her face while exclaiming: 'Lordy, lordy, lordy!'
Then she burst into singing 'I'm feeling hot, hot, hot!' as she danced around.
Just when I thought things couldn't possibly get any more toe-curling, she shouted: 'Mommy needs some milk!' before pulling out a baby bottle from her purse and guzzling down the milk.
The humiliating farce ended with Meghan asking another female vendor if she would like to hear a joke.
'Why did the elephant put his trunk in the cookie jar?' she said, then stayed silent and refused to reveal the punchline before bursting out laughing and saying to the bemused vendor: 'It's funny, isn't it?'
Well, no, it wasn't.
None of this was remotely funny.
It was all just incredibly, soul-suckingly excruciating.
In the final scene, Meghan put on a pair of kitten ears and burst into song again, prancing around in her ears as she wailed: 'I'm a kitten, mew mew mew.'
By this point I needed my sick bucket to go ew, ew, ew.
Honestly, it all made me genuinely want to puke.
This is a senior member of the British Royal Family whose husband Prince Harry is sixth in line to the throne, behaving like a gormless desperate reality TV starlet.
Royals don't do this kind of thing for a very good reason.
The public expects them to behave in a regal manner, that is the mystique that preserves the Monarchy.
It may seem anachronistic to many Americans, but it works. The Royals bring in billions of pounds in tourism money to the UK and the Queen remains the world's most revered head of state.
Take away the mystique and the very future of the Monarchy itself may be imperiled, especially given that Her Majesty, now 95, has been in recent worryingly poor health.
That's why what Meghan Markle and Harry get up to carries significance and cannot be dismissed as inconsequential.
So long as they're still the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, their behavior directly impacts on the reputation of the Royal Family.
And just as Prince Andrew's - far more serious - behavior in refusing to be interviewed by the FBI about his relationship with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein is causing huge damage to that reputation, so Meghan and Harry's constant self-publicizing, royal-bashing antics are, in a very different way, doing consistent damage too.
Last night's Ellen debacle exposed Meghan Markle's desire to be a jobbing C-list reality TV celebrity, not a jobbing A-list royal.
But even a Kardashian would have deemed that street vendor stunt beneath them and brand-damaging.
That's how puerile and embarrassing it was.
For a British royal to demean herself in such a way is completely unacceptable.
Not just because it made Meghan Markle look ridiculous, but because it made the British Monarchy look ridiculous.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the Queen must strip the Duke and Duchess of Sussex of their royal titles before their brazen, craven, money-grabbing campaign to fleece their duty-free royal status destroys everything she has worked so hard to maintain.",-2
51,"Meghan Markle's 'I'm just a mom' routine on Ellen DeGeneres' show will be a hit with Americans who 'celebrate' celebrity, a royal commentator has said.
British journalist Emily Andrews joined the Good Morning Britain team today to discuss the Duchess of Sussex's first major TV interview since her notorious tell-all with Oprah Winfrey.
Meghan, a former Suits actress who is living in a $14million mansion in California with husband Prince Harry and their children Archie and Lilibet, left a group of Los Angeles street vendors open-mouthed in shock by dancing and singing in front of them while referring to herself as 'mommy' as part of a cringe-worthy on-the-street prank with DeGeneres.
The 40-year-old made a clear attempt to distance herself from the royal family's reserved image during her surprise appearance, when she stepped outside of the studio to pull a prank on a trio of vendors, which saw her forced to do and say whatever the talk show host told her to via a hidden ear piece.
But Ms Andrews suggested many Americans 'will love' the duchess' 'acting' and 'I'm just a mom' image after she recently caused controversy by cold-calling US senators on their private phones and using her royal title to urge them to vote in favour of compulsory paid family leave.
The royal commentator said: 'We often talk, don't we, about the fact that you know the British sense of humour, the American sense of humour, the fact that she struggled maybe slightly over here because she is very American.
'In America celebrity and achievement is celebrated. In the UK... you don't want to get too big for you boots. We do celebrate but we're very understated. Which is completely opposite in America.
'I think she has needed to reboot her image a little bit because some Americans, I've been told by friends out there, felt that her politicising, her ringing, cold calling senators, on paid family leave, now look, the Americans fought a war to get rid of the British royal family, over 220 years ago, and now there's a member of the royal family - yes she's American and married in - but a member of the royal family campaigning. 
'And so I think many Americans will love this, they'll love the fact that she sent herself up, they'll love the acting. It's sort of very homespun, ""I'm just a mom"", I'm helping people, it's a very important part of her image.'
She added that Meghan was trying hard to build her brand as a philanthropist. 
'What she was doing though [on The Ellen Show], was so royal, that's what the royals do, they highlight the work of other people, they put the limelight and the spotlight on ordinary people, and of course, Meghan as we know likes the limelight on herself,' added Ms Andrews. 
The duchess renewed calls for compulsory paid family leave in the US in her soft-soap interview with close friend Ellen.
She told the host she would do 'everything' in her power to change US policy for millions of Americans. 
The duchess recently caused controversy by cold-calling US senators on their private phones and using her royal title to urge them to vote in favour of paid leave. Previously she wrote a letter to the US Congress asking them to considering making paid leave law. 
Republican Representative Jason Smith of Missouri condemned Meghan for interfering in American politics, and even suggested she should be stripped of her title to stop her using it to gain political leverage.
Meghan told The Ellen Show: 'I think that people truly forget, or don't even know that in this country, it's one of the only six countries in the entire world and the only wealthy nation in the entire world that does not mandate and have a federal paid leave programme.
'Everybody knows, especially if you have had a child and even if you haven't, you know how hard it is and how critical it is in those first few weeks if not months to be together as a family. 
'And the fact that we don't offer that here is something that now as a mom of two, I will do everything that I can to make sure that we can implement that for people.' 
Meghan also promoted her children's book The Bench, which she said she wrote as a poem for Harry on Father's Day.
Elsewhere, to kick off her prank during the show, DeGeneres asked Meghan to touch her elbow and nose, and then do a squat to confirm that she could hear all of the talk show host's instructions, while one of the series' producers approached the vendors to inform them that the duchess wished to browse their stalls.
'I am executive assistant to Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex and she's here today and would love to just shop normally,' the producer - using the name Pwamma - told them. 'She just wants to be treated normally. Don't try to act any other way, just totally normal. Is that cool?'
Meghan then approached the first vendor and began inspecting the crystals on their stall, before DeGeneres instructed her to hold one to her head and begin groaning and moaning.
'I'm going to hold this against my head,' the mother-of-two told the perplexed salesperson, before closing her eyes and mumbling, adding: 'That is wonderful.'
Moving on to the next vendor, who was showcasing different varieties of hot sauce, Meghan began 'bouncing up and down' in excitement at DeGeneres's request, asking the man: 'What do we have here? What have you got, what have you got, what have you got?'
Inspecting the bottles of hot sauce lined up on the table, Meghan then told the baffled vendor: 'Let mommy have a taste,' before telling him, 'My boo loves hot sauce.'
After being presented with a hot sauce covered chip, the duchess proceeded to chomp down on it 'like a chipmunk' and DeGeneres's behest, nibbling on the snack while holding it to her mouth with both hands, before telling the salesman: 'That's not spicy! Let me try something real hot, mommy wants some heat.
'Let's get the spiciest, let's get the hottest.'
Seizing another chip from the man, Meghan was then instructed to 'shove the whole thing in her mouth' - and then begin furiously fanning at her face while saying: 'Oh lordy, lordy, lordy.
'I'm feeling hot, hot, hot,' she then sang to the tune of the hit song by The Merrymen. 'Mommy needs some milk.'
The duchess went on to pull out a baby bottle from her purse and vigorously swig milk from it, all while the vendor looked on open-mouthed, unable to hide his bewilderment over her behaviour.
PAID FAMILY LEAVE
I think that people truly forget, or don't even know that in this country, it's one of the only six countries in the entire world and the only wealthy nation in the entire world that does not mandate and have a federal paid leave programme.
Everybody knows, especially if you have had a child and even if you haven't, you know how hard it is and how critical it is in those first few weeks if not months to be together as a family. 
And the fact that we don't offer that here is something that now as a mom of two, I will do everything that I can to make sure that we can implement that for people.
HALLOWEEN   
We wanted to do something fun for the kids and then the kids were not into it at all. Archie was a dinosaur for maybe five minutes. Still not even five minutes, Harry talked him into putting the head on.
But Lilibet was a skunk and it was so cute. She was the flower from Bambi. 
HARRY IN CALIFORNIA
He loves it (living in California). 
We moved here during lockdown so everything was shut down, so we have been able to spend a lot of time at home and creating our home, but it's a lifestyle and the weather is pretty great. We're just happy.
ON LILIBET TEETHING
She is a good sleeper, but the teeth are coming in, so any mom will understand where you go they may be the best in the world, but the moment that is happening you have so much sympathy, so yes, I am up most of the night.
ON HER BOOK 'THE BENCH'
It was about my observation of him (Harry) and him being a dad, which was the most beautiful thing to watch.
Once it was shared with a couple of friends and people that we were close with, they said, 'No this resonates for me too because it feels really inclusive and there's representation and it's just like a sweet love story between a family', and so I said, 'OK let's turn it into a children's book'. 
ON HER NIGHT OUT WITH PRINCESS EUGENIE
He (Harry) came to see me in Toronto and our friends and his cousin Eugenie and now her husband Jack, they came as well, and the four of us snuck out in Halloween costumes to just have one fun night on the town before it was out in the world that we were a couple. 
It was a post-apocalypse theme, so we had all this very bizarre costuming on, and we were able to just have one fun final night out.
ON AUDITIONING AT WARNER BROS LOT
So I had this very old Ford Explore Sport and at a certain point the key stopped working on the driver's side, so you couldn't get yourself in through the door so after auditions I would park at the back of the parking lot and I would open the trunk and climb in, pull the door shut behind me and crawl all over my seats to get out. That's how I would come to and fro. 
I would park on gate three and I would scoot on over and the security guards here would always say 'break a leg, I hope you get it'. So driving today was very different.
ON SELLING SCRUNCHIES AT SCHOOL
My mom would take me down to downtown LA where all the fabrics are, you can buy them really affordably and I would get some of the remnants and I would buy the elastic and tied the knot and I had a sewing machine, and I made scrunchies and sold them at school, this is when I was at elementary school.
It was a thing at the time and I guess they are back now, people are wearing scrunchies again.",-2
52,"It has not been seen on TV screens for nearly 20 years despite having been one of Britain's most watched programme and exported to half of the world's countries.
But now The Benny Hill Show - famous in the 1970s for the comedian's slapstick character chasing scantily-clad young women, but threatened by the 'cancel culture' of the modern age - has made a surprise comeback on a nostalgia channel.
The show, which consisted of short and often risqué comedy sketches, made Hill a huge star on first the BBC and then ITV, airing for four decades from 1955.
But Hill was dumped by broadcaster Thames in 1989 amid fears from executives that his raucous and racy sense of humour were seen by some as sexist and vulgar.
The rights to Hill's TV shows were controlled following his death in 1992 by his estate and Thames TV and had not been licensed to any UK broadcaster since then.
But a series of re-runs which began last night now form part of the festive schedule on Freeview channel That's TV Gold, renamed That's TV Christmas for the season.
The channel, also available on Sky and Freesat, launched under its new name at 9pm last night with a double bill of The Benny Hill Show - the first in a seven-week run.
TV specials from Kenny Everett, Mike Yarwood, Tommy Cooper and the Carry On team are also on the schedule, alongside rare repeats of prank show Beadle's About.
One series that is still a regular on TV screens at Christmas is Morecambe and Wise, but a new long-long episode is set to bring fans a treat this year.
The BBC are set to screen the old episode next month after it was found in an attic by Eric Morecambe's son Gary, 65, inside a film canister marked only with a BBC stamp.
It has only ever been shown once before more than 50 years ago on October 8, 1970 when it was watched by an audience of 14million.
But the 45-minute film has now been restored and colourised by BBC experts, and contains sketches with songs and music from Paul Anka, Patricia Lambert and Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen.
A BBC source told the Daily Mirror: 'We were so excited to hear that this episode, long considered lost, still exists. This should be a real Christmas treat for comedy fans. It's an absolute delight.'
Hill has been cited as one of the first victims of 'political correctness' when his slapstick gags and cross-dressing became uncomfortable viewing for some viewers nearly two decades ago.
At the time Thames pulled the plug, the comic had earned the company an estimated £100million and his final episode attracted 9.58million viewers. 
Hill was born 'Alfred Hall' in 1925 in Southampton and was remembered by his relatives and schoolfriends as the 'class clown'. 
He dropped out of school as a teenager and worked as a milkman before serving in the British Army during the Second World War as a mechanic with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
While the conflict continued, he enjoyed entertaining troops in variety shows and adopted his stage name, Benny Hill, in homage to comedian Jack Benny.
After the war, Hill performed in London music halls and got his break in TV after comparing a BBC entertainment show.
His programme aired from December 1962 to December 1968 on the BBC, and from December 1969 to May 1989 on ITV, before re-runs took place until 1992. 
At his height of his fame more Britons tuned in to watch Benny Hill than the moon landing and the comedian won his first of many awards in 1954 when voted TV Personality of the Year.
The Benny Hill Show received a total of 11 awards during his time with ITV and his shows were exported to more than 140 countries.
A string of modern comedians have hailed Hill's influence on them. TV star David Walliams previously said in 2017 he wished Hill was 'celebrated more on TV'.
Comedian Tim Vine from Not Going Out has claimed to have kept all his old Benny Hill VHS tapes, saying: 'I never tire of it, and I think he's hugely underrated.'
And the late Caroline Aherne, writer of sitcom The Royale Family, told a Channel 4 documentary in 1998: 'I loved Benny Hill so much'. 
And comedian Ben Miller of Armstrong and Miller fame said: 'His early work was ground-breaking. He is the most successful comedian on a world-wide stage that Britain has ever produced.' 
When Hill died, US actor Jack Lemmon said: 'In recent years my favourite comedian above all was Benny Hill, who was a master in his field. 
'Most comedians deliver a barrage of powder puffs; Benny gave you a cannon shot.'
Hill's health declined in the late 1980s and he died of coronary thrombosis aged 68 in in Teddington, South West London, two months after suffering a mild heart attack.
Kris Vaiksalu, That's TV Christmas head of programming, said: 'We are excited to have secured the rights to two of the biggest shows in British TV history, The Benny Hill Show and Beadle's About, for our seasonal rebrand this year.  
'These shows are part of our national cultural heritage. Watching age-old comedy is a national Christmas tradition but for two decades these particular favourites have been missing from the festivities.
'We all need some festive cheer following the past year. Our viewers have inundated us with requests to show Benny Hill and we're thrilled to be able to make this Christmas wish come true.'
He continued: 'But there are lots more crackers on That's TV Christmas. We've lined up a Christmas TV nostalgia-fest with some of the most famous names in TV and music from the past four decades.
'We aim to give our viewers a special Christmas time full of magical memories. You better watch out… because Benny Hill and Jeremy Beadle are back on your telly this Christmas!' 
Other shows in the coming weeks include Beadle's About, the hidden camera show presented by prankster Jeremy Beadle, which ran from 1986 for ten years. 
The Benny Hill Show is showing on That’s TV Christmas for seven weeks, available on Freeview channels 91 and 264, Sky channel 187 and Freesat channel 178 ",-2
53,"Former NFL running back Zac Stacy faces felony charges in Florida while his ex-girlfriend - who posted video of Stacy assaulting her at her home in front of their son to social media - believes his friends are hiding him as he remains on the loose. 
Home surveillance footage shows Zac Stacy, 30, attacking the mother of his child in front of their five-month-old son at her Florida home on Saturday. 
The footage was posted on social media by the victim, Kristin Evans, who claimed in an Instagram story earlier Thursday that Stacy's friends are hiding him. 
'I just want to say thank you, everyone, who has continued to support me in this ordeal. He's still not apprehended, I don't know why. His friends are hiding him. Please, if you know anything, contact your local authorities. If you see him, he drives a white Kia Optima, a 2020 or 2021.' 
'If you see him or you know of any location that he might be, please turn him in or call your local authorities.' 
In a further Instagram story post, she asked President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for help. 
Evans confirmed Thursday evening that the Oakland PD has provided security assistance to her and placed her 'in an undisclosed location.' 
Stacy faces two felony charges from the incident of aggravated battery and criminal mischief, according to an affadavit. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison on aggravated battery and up to five on criminal mischief.   
Evans, 32, has now filed for a restraining order against Stacy, a former fifth round pick who played in eight games for the Jets in 2015.
The order claims that Stacy has been abusing her since she was pregnant with her son, with the attacks escalating and no signs of stopping.
Evans wrote: 'He will not stop. He will kill me and he will feel justified in his actions.' 
She also revealed that Stacy was 'voluntarily hospitalized for mental illness' for a month in March of 2021 and is taking medication for his afflictions.
Speaking to DailyMail.com Thursday, Evans did not think that his football career was responsible for his mental issues but that they may have exacerbated them. 
Prior to that, Stacy spent two years with the St. Louis Rams. He last played in the now-defunct Alliance of American Football in 2019 with the Memphis Express. That was when Stacy met Evans, who was a wellness coordinator for the team.  
The incident has forced both a prominent college bowl game and the National Down Syndrome Society to sever ties with the ex-running back. 
Evans can be heard begging for Stacy to stop in the disturbing video.
Evans claimed on social media Wednesday that Stacy is still on the loose in the Nashville area and that officers in the town of Oakland, where she lives, took four days to issue a warrant.
'The Oakland PD officers that came to my house didn't seem to think this was a bad enough incident to make an immediate arrest or to file for an immediate warrant. It took four days of me calling people and an Orange County officer speaking on my behalf,' she wrote.
In a statement Thursday, Oakland police said that they arrived at the scene by 2:30pm but that Stacy had fled the scene. Officers searched for him while the case was forwarded to an investigations unit in an attempt to establish probable cause for a warrant. 
Local and county police attempted to apprehend him but they found he had fled the state. They are urging him to turn himself in and face criminal charges.   
According to a restraining order filed by Evans, the pair met in January 2019 as they worked together in Memphis. They didn't become romantic until later in the year. 
Evans said that at the beginning he was funny, relaxed and they had a lot in common.  
Things started to go downhill after they had some difficulties in December 2019, when Evans miscarried.  
'We decided to take some time apart then got back together.' 
Evans became pregnant in 2021 and Stacy moved to Florida in April, where he was managing a gym. She said that things have 'been a roller coaster' since then.   
The incident began when the former football player visited his son at Evans' house at around 2pm on Saturday. The two had been living apart since August. 
But once there, he began addressing her over an incident that took place in September 2020 when she and a financial advisor of Stacy's met with him out of concern for his mental health issues. 
Evans claimed in the restraining order that he flew into a jealous rage and attacked his ex, punching Evans multiple times in the head before dragging her from the couch and throwing her into the TV, which then fell on her. 
'He punched me several times in the head! I begged him to stop because the baby was on the couch just a few feet from where he punched me,' Evans wrote in her restraining order application. 
She added: 'He then picked me up and threw me into my TV. The TV began to fall and he turned to make sure I wasn't getting up. 
'As I laid on the floor he began to yell at me, telling me I'm destructive. He then picked me up off the floor and off my feet and body slammed me into our son's bouncy seat.
'I fear for my life and my children's lives,' Evans - who has a 12-year-old daughter from a previous relationship - wrote in the application.
The victim says that after the attack, Stacy said 'I love you' to the baby boy and left before she called 911.  
Evans then took herself to hospital where she was treated for a possible head wound and bruising. She said that she couldn't walk without limping. 
The victim previously filed a police report in October when Stacy allegedly slapped her while she was holding the baby for claiming that she'd found out his apartment number at the place he'd moved into after they stopped living together.
She added that he assaulted her several times on August 15 because he wanted money back that he had given Evans for rent. 
In that incident, Evans said Stacy punched her legs, slapped her and picked her up and threw her into her window, which broke. 
Stacy's violence, according to the restraining order, extends back to the weeks before their son was born. 
When asked why she didn't file a police report then: 'Because I'm an abuse victim and I wanted to see the good in him. I wanted to give him an opportunity to get better. I was scared and I was pregnant.' 
She has expressed her outrage at Florida police on social media. 
'The Florida justice system has been failing me,' she wrote. 'I have filed police reports previously and the State Attorney hasn't picked them up. Other women fall victim to this everyday. Please call attention to the Florida State Attorney.' 
State attorneys are equivalent to district attorneys in the Sunshine State. 
In a statement to DailyMail.com, a spokesperson for the Orange and Osceola Counties State Attorney denied that they were being lax on the case. 
'While we cannot discuss any open and active investigation, we can confirm that we have recently received and reviewed an isolated case package in our office,' the statement said. 'Unequivocally, the Office of the State Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit is committed to working collaboratively with community and law enforcement partners to end domestic violence in our circuit. This incident has been assigned to our Office’s Domestic Violence Unit and a victim’s advocate has been assigned to communicate directly with the victim. Victims of domestic violence are urged to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline for confidential assistance from trained advocates at 1-800-799-7233.'
Stacy joined the Jets in 2015 and previously played two seasons for the St. Louis Rams. He broke his ankle that season, limiting himself to just eight games and never again played in the NFL.  
Evans most recently was a 'youth football ambassador' for the TransPerfect Music City Bowl in Nashville. 
The game - which pits a team from the Big Ten against a team from the SEC - quickly announced it was severing ties with Stacy Thursday morning. 
'Based on the video and domestic violence report regarding Zac Stacy, the TransPerfect Music City Bowl has terminated the relationship with Zac Stacy effective immediately,' the organization said in a release. 
Stacy had most recently given an interview in 2020, claiming his faith played a constant role in his life. 
'I have always been a guy who never really looks at accolades or stats. It has always been about putting my team first, being professional (and giving) glory to God. For any recognition or accolade that I have, He gets all the glory,' said Stacy in a 2020 interview. 
Stacy also promoted his work as an ambassador for the National Down Syndrome Society. The organization released a statement Thursday saying they would not work with him again.
'The National Down Syndrome Society is horrified by the video of former NFL football player Zac Stacy attacking the mother of his child,' the statement read. 'NDSS last partnered with him in 2019 to conduct a football clinic for individuals with Down syndrome and their siblings. We do not have a current partnership with Zac, and we will not renew our partnership with him. This terrible act of violence goes against our core values as an organization. Our support goes to the victim and her family.'
Players across the National Football League weighed in on the situation Thursday.
Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davonta Adams tweeted: 'I'm not retweeting the video but ZAC STACY NEED TO BE THROWN UNDER THE JAIL. Any man that puts his hands on a woman is a coward. Can't believe what I just say.'
Retired 2-time Super Bowl champion Chris Long, an ex-teammate of Stacy with the Rams, wrote: 'Woke up to the Zac Stacy video. Made my stomach turn. Not retweeting. Crazy to play w[ith] someone for a couple years & you have no idea what kind of bulls--t they do at home.' 
Former NFL safety Darius Butler was more blunt: ""I hope Zac Stacy is somewhere gettin[g] his a-- whooped right now! Any man that puts their hands on a woman is a SUCKA in my book.' ",-2
54,"Question Time panellist Nazir Afzal U-turned today as he backed Fiona Bruce, saying he had 'no criticism' of the host after accusing her on the show of asking him first about the cricket racism row because he is a 'brown person'.
The BBC programme has become embroiled in an 'unconscious racism' row after Bruce asked Mr Afzal, the only non-white member of the panel, to be the first person to answer an audience member's query about racism. 
During the show, Mr Afzal agreed with Bruce that he thought she was 'wrong' to go to him first. But reacting this morning after the incident prompted huge debate online, Mr Afzal tweeted: 'I have no criticism of Fiona Bruce. 
'I made point that racism is something which everyone should have a view on, not just minorities. If the subject was say child or domestic abuse, you wouldn't just ask the victim. It's everybody's business.' 
The question, which was partly about recent allegations of racist abuse made by cricketer Azeem Rafiq, was asked last night to a panel made up of former crown prosecutor Mr Afzal; white psychologist Jordan Peterson; and three white MPs - Mims Davies from the Conservatives, Stella Creasy of Labour and Stephen Flynn from the SNP.

Bruce then immediately turned to Mr Afzal and asked him to answer, prompting him to say: 'The brown person will answer first'. As he made the comment he turned to the audience and laughed, which saw some chuckle with him.
The presenter then asked him: 'Nazir, so do you think that was wrong of me to come to you first?' Mr Afzal replied: 'I think so' and attempted to continue answering the question while pointing towards the audience.
But Bruce then added: 'Well let's not do it. I'm not being sarcastic at all. I mean if that's how you feel, I respect that.' Mr Afzal then stopped speaking and sat silently, while Bruce went to Mr Peterson to hear from him instead. 
Mr Nazir's parents were from Pakistan but he was born in Birmingham. He is known for his prosecutions of the Rochdale child sex abuse ring in 2012 and has featured on the Asian Power 100 and Muslim Power 100 lists. 
Amid much discussion about the programme last night on Twitter, one viewer branded what they called Bruce's 'unconscious racism' as 'incredible', while another said: 'Fair play to Nazir there putting Fiona Bruce in her place.'
But Shahrar Ali - the former Green Party deputy leader from 2014 to 2016, who was the first Black, Asian and minority ethnic deputy of a UK parliamentary party - supported Bruce and praised her quick reaction.
He tweeted: 'I really like the way Fiona Bruce changed order of panelists after Nazir Afzal made throwaway comment that she just had to come to him first. She changed tack and said she wasn't being patronising.' 
Mr Ali added: 'Afzal is brilliantly insightful on this topic but may have been over interpreting that situation. Plus even if she did want to go to him first because he might have greater insight because of his background or campaigning work that also wouldn't be prejudice.' 
And another Twitter user pointed out: 'From what I can see she went to him first because he hadn't spoken in a while. I don't think skin colour was anything to do with it.'
Later in the discussion, fellow panellist Stella Creasy said: 'All of us have a challenge to ask ourselves, of whether we are normalising forms of racism.
'And actually I think that is what Nazir called you [Fiona] to account to about Fiona tonight was to say, 'we normalise the idea that if we are going to talk about racism we go to the person of colour first and ask them to give their hot take.'
 Bruce said she always tries to 'go to everyone on the panel first', so that 'everyone has a go at the first question'. 
As the programme neared its end, Mr Afzal asked Bruce to 'forgive' him for his earlier answer, but then added: 'The reality is that brown people, black people, people from minorities are tired of having to continue to describe how much racism we experience on a daily basis.'
Reacting to the exchange on Twitter, another social media user said: 'Nazir Afzal was spot on. That look from Fiona Bruce in being called upon on it though.' 
Another claimed: 'Fiona Bruce is raging after being called out immediately asking the only ethnic minority about racism - BBC need to put her on unconscious bias training.'    
Panellist Jordan Peterson - who was also joined on the panel by the Scottish National Party's Stephen Flynn and Conservative employment minister Mims Davis - leapt to Bruce's defence after Mr Ali said he did think it was wrong of her to ask him to answer the question about racism first.  
He said that Bruce's decision to go to Mr Afzal first was a 'mark of respect'. He added: 'That may have been inappropriate and it may have been taken wrong but that doesn't mean it was racist.'  
In his own response to the audience member's question, Mr Peterson said: 'Things need to be particularised rather than generalised as a general rule lets say.
'This cricketer was facing racism, by his own account. The question is, 'who? When? What? Exactly.' 

'Because otherwise it degenerates into something like a discussion of structural racism.
'And when it becomes abstracted up to that level, first of all that pits group against group, which I think is entirely counter-productive and it actually doesn't address the issue.'  
However, the popular author then attracted criticism from the rest of the panel when he waved his fingers in the air as he said that 'racism' is a 'global and vague term'. 
Mr Flynn angrily asked: 'Sorry, why would you possibly do that? What did that mean?…As if it wasn't a real thing?' 
Mr Peterson responded by claiming that the hand sign was 'indicative or low resolution thinking'.
Ms Creasy then said: 'He [Rafiq] was repeatedly called abusive terms directly linked to his ethnicity.'   
When Mr Peterson asked, 'By who', Ms Creasy added: 'By not just one but repeated members of the Yorkshire cricket club.  If it walks like a duck Jordan and talks like a duck it is a duck. It's racism.'
Mr Peterson then insisted that he was not 'denying' the cricketer's experience.  'What I asked was 'exactly who and when' and you just answered that question,' he added.
'And so I would say those specific people should be held specifically to account for their actions before any movement up the abstraction hierarchy to a discussion of something like structural racism, which I don't think is helpful.'

55,"A Russian model who put two million Swarovski diamonds onto her £270,000 Lamborghini Aventado has been left with a new car bill - after it was wrecked in a crash.
Daria Radionova, 26, had the black supercar customised with the crystals to show off her bling lifestyle to her 626,000 Instagram followers.
The motor - which has a top speed of 217mph - even has a personalised numberplate DAR 11A so people know who it belongs to.
But the unusual vehicle is now off the road after being involved in a crash in Kensington, west London yesterday. 
A picture emerged showing the rear of the car completely smashed up after another vehicle seemingly smashed into the back of it.
Ms Radionova posted about the mishap this lunchtime but it is not known who was in the car at the time.
She offered a cash reward to anyone with information about a blue Vauxhall car. 
Last night, a friend of Ms Radionova posted a video of the pair driving through Oxford Street in a car, though it remains unclear who was driving and what car they were travelling in.  
It will come as a devastating blow to her as it is one of her most prized possessions.
She regularly shows it off on her social media platforms to her fans.
Only a week ago she put up two pictures of it at a garage in Knightsbridge being filled up with petrol.
Then on Monday she Instragramed another of her in a baseball cap getting out of the driver's seat.
The location appeared to be a similar road to where the crash happened.
Ms Radionova was first known to have been the owner of the car back in 2019.

56,"England's Covid cases dipped 10 per cent last week, according to official figures that come amid mounting fears the outbreak is heading in the wrong direction again.
The Office for National Statistics' weekly surveillance report, based on random swab tests of thousands of Britons, estimated 824,900 people were infected on any day in the week ending November 13, the equivalent to one in 65 people. This was down slightly from 925,400 previously.
But in a warning sign that the downturn in infections has stalled, No10's top scientific advisers today claimed the R rate remained level between 0.8 and 1.0 last week. 
And a slew of reports yesterday suggested infections are trending upwards among children after they returned to the classroom from half-term. Official Government statistics, which offer the most up-to-date picture, showed the same.  
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He urged people to get their booster vaccines and warned of Europe's spiralling crisis, which saw Austria become the first country to impose another lockdown. 
Despite the growing concerns over the continent's outbreak, top experts are confident Britain won't be forced into cancelling Christmas again. One scientist behind a surveillance study showing cases were ticking upwards said he remained 'optimistic' that festivities could go ahead without any restrictions.
The ONS surveillance report relies on random swabbing of more than 100,000 Britons every week to estimate the prevalence of the virus across the country.
It is seen as the gold-standard method of tracking the country's outbreak by ministers because it is not affected by asymptomatic carriers.
Figures suggest Wales had the highest infection rate in the UK last week, with one in 55 people likely infected with the virus. It was followed by England and Northern Ireland, at one in 65, and Scotland, at one in 95.
Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 63.9 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus, one of the lowest uptakes of the jabs in western Europe. 
When cases were broken down by age groups, figures showed only 11 to 16-year-olds saw a drop in cases last week. Infections flatlined in all other groups.
Meanwhile, No10's top scientists estimated the R rate was still between 0.8 and 1.0, the same as the previous week.
But they said in London and the South East it could now be above the cut-off point and be as high as 1.1, which would mean an outbreak is growing. 
The R rate is a lagging indicator measuring how many infected people are passing the virus on. It reflects the situation on the ground up to three weeks ago, simply because of how it is calculated.
An R below one suggests that for every ten people who catch the virus, they are passing it on to fewer than ten others.
Two separate surveillance reports yesterday suggested Covid cases are now rising in younger age groups, too.
King's College London scientists, who track symptoms instead of tests, also estimated infections dipped 10 per cent overall last week, but they said cases appeared to be trending upwards among under-18s. 
There was still a drop in cases for over-75s, while they flatlined in all other age groups.
And the UK Health Security Agency weekly surveillance report, which is based on Government testing rates, estimated cases rose sharply in over-18s last week. 
It said cases also rose slightly among under-70s, but dipped in older age groups.
Britain's daily Covid cases also appear to be trending upwards, with rises in younger age groups and 50 to 65-year-olds appearing to drive the increase.
Professor Tim Spector, the eminent scientist who leads the King's College study, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' Christmas will be business as usual this year. 
He said: 'In terms of what it means for Christmas, I’m cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. It’s becoming clear that children and the school holidays play a key role in the waves of infection. 
'I think it’s safe to say that we can expect to see another rise in the new year after the holidays.'
But he still called on all Britons to get fully vaccinated against the virus, as well as ensuring they have their booster doses. And he urged everyone to start using face masks in crowded spaces such as public transport.
This was a softening in his tone from last month when he joined a chorus of experts calling on ministers to switch to Plan B — bringing back hated face masks, social distancing and work from home guidance. 
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He told a Downing Street press conference: 'Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to — non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions — get the boosters.' 
Austria is the first Western nation to mandate vaccines, but it far from the first.
A handful of tinpot dictatorships, smaller nations, and at least one large democracy has already issued vaccine mandates. They are:
Indonesia: President Joko Widodo made jabs mandatory in February this year, with anyone who refuses facing a £250 fine - roughly two months' salary - and being disqualified from receiving state benefits
Tajikistan: From July this year, all adults over the age of 18 were required to get vaccinated by order of the country's Covid task-force. It did not specify a penalty for those who refuse
Turkmenistan: Though dictator Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has refused to acknowledge having a single case in the country, he never-the-less made vaccination mandatory for all over-18s starting in July. Punishments for refusal were not specified 
Micronesia: A small South Pacific island nation, it mandated in July that its adult population had to be inoculated against Covid
New Caledonia: A French dependency also located in the South Pacific, it ordered its entire adult population to get vaccinated starting in September 
It comes after Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 66 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus. This is just below the 67 per cent average for the EU, and the UK where 68 per cent are double-jabbed. 
It is not the first country to make vaccines compulsory. Indonesia required all adults to get jabbed back in February, followed by dictatorships Turkmenistan and Tajikistan in July. Dozens of other countries, including many western nations, require specific groups — such as healthcare workers — to be fully inoculated. 
Speaking today, Schallenberg said: 'For a long time there was consensus in this country that we do not want vaccinations to be compulsory.
'For a long time, maybe too long, it was assumed that it would be possible to achieve a high vaccination rate even without an obligation. Now we have to face reality.
'Whipped up by radical anti-vaxxers, by fake news, too many among us didn't get vaccinated. The results are overcrowded intensive care units and enormous suffering,' he added, accusing the un-jabbed of launching an 'attack on the health system.' 
Ireland, which imposed a night-time curfew on hospitality businesses this week, has today placed its hospitals on a 'war footing' with routine operations cancelled to make room for Covid patients amid a warning from the country's top doctor that intensive care medics face 'unthinkable' choices over who to give care to.
And Germany's incoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz said almost 30 million vaccines need to be administered before the end of the year to ward off the worst effects of the winter wave, which would require the country to more-than double the number of shots it currently gives each day.
He spoke a day after Germany put forward new rules that would restrict the movements of unvaccinated people in states where hospital admissions are high. 
The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states.
It comes as the NHS app is being updated to show proof of booster jabs in a move which could save Christmas travel plans for the elderly and vulnerable.
It will appear on the travel section of the Covid pass, allowing Britons to visit parts of Europe which now require evidence of a third dose.
While the new feature will initially be limited to travel, it could also make it easier for the UK Government to make the third jab compulsory in domestic circumstances. 
Boris Johnson warned on Monday that the concept of full vaccination would need to be adjusted – with a third jab becoming part of it.
Almost 14million Britons have had the booster but the goal is to administer 40million to people over the age of 40. Younger adults may also be offered the jabs in the near future.
A small but growing number of countries, including Switzerland, Croatia and Israel, are now requesting proof of boosters for arrivals vaccinated many months ago.
France has indicated that proof of a third jab will be required for over-65s to access most venues from December 15.
Austria had required proof of a booster but announced today it is going into a full nationwide lockdown from Monday. The move, which comes just days after the Government imposed a lockdown only for the unvaccinated, makes Austria the first Western European to retreat back into a draconian shutdown since the summer.

57,"Terrifying footage captured the moment a gang armed with Tasers robbed two men of their watches in the middle of a busy London street. 
The three muggers can be seen knocking their victims to the ground after violently stunning them - and then making off with two watches. 
The incident happened on Tuesday evening in Knightsbridge, central London just metres away from Britain's most expensive penthouse at One Hyde Park as well as Harrods.
A bystander can be heard shouting 'leave them alone' as one of the hooded men fires a stun gun at one man.
The crackling sound and bright flashes could be seen coming from the Taser as the muggers incapacitate their targets.
One of the victims drops to the floor and the masked men appear to search his pockets looking for valuables.
Another of the gang members could also be seen holding a knife.
A man filming the incident from above shouts at the group: 'I am calling the police. Police, Police, Police,' but the group continue their assault.
After appearing to find some items, the thugs jump into a black getaway car before driving off down the street.
A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a robbery in Knightsbridge.
'At around 12:05am on Tuesday, November 16, a group were walking along when they were approached by three males who threatened the group before stealing two watches.
'They also assaulted two males in the group.
'The suspects - who were armed with two stun guns and a knife - then fled in a car driven by a fourth person.
'None of the victims suffered serious injuries during the incident.
'No arrests, enquiries continue.'
Footage of the attack was posted on social media, provoking an angry response from Londoners. 
One person commented: 'Robbing them for their watches. Mental.'  
Another added: 'Probably had an expensive item they wanted sad idiots.'
A third wrote: 'Every time like these actions are happen on #knightsbridge London.'
It is an offence to carry a stun gun in Britain and there have been numerous cases of people being jailed for not realising they are illegal. 
There have previously been concerns around gangs switching from knives to tasers in robberies and assaults, with some devices disguised as phones, torches and even lipsticks.
It was reported that some stun guns used by criminals were up to 100 times more powerful than the devices being used by police forces.
The cruel tactic has been going on for several years, with an FOI request in 2015 finding that Scotland Yard had destroyed 249 stun guns, crossbows and harpoons the previous year.
The devices can apparently be bought online anonymously and shipped from as far away is Asia for as little as £70, The Times reported.
In 2015, Surrey police seized two stun guns disguised as mobile phones and two 'ultra-charged' JSJ 811 Tasers brought in from China. ",-2
58,"A 19-year-old has denied the murder of his younger sister at a holiday park.
Matthew Selby pleaded not guilty to the murder of his sister Amanda, 15, when he appeared at Mold Crown Court by videolink from HMP Berwyn today.
She died after police were called to reports of a 'domestic disturbance' at the Ty Mawr Holiday Park in Towyn, near Abergele, North Wales, on Saturday July 31.
Selby, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, spoke only to confirm his name and enter his plea during the 10-minute hearing.
Judge Rhys Rowlands adjourned the case ahead of a trial on February 28, which is due to last up to seven days.
Following her death, Amanda's family released a statement through North Wales Police which said: 'Amanda was a loving daughter and granddaughter - she was caring, thoughtful, liked to help others and very much loved. She will be very sadly missed.'
Her school, Droylsden Academy in Greater Manchester, also paid tribute to her.
A message on its website said: 'Our school family is devastated by this awful news. Amanda was a lovely student and she will be sorely missed by students and staff.'
At an earlier hearing prosecutor James Neary said there was no entitlement to bail while Selby's defence solicitor Simon Sargent said: 'I have nothing to add, save to say this a tragic case.' 
 When Amanda died an  air ambulance rushed to the scene, as parts of the Parkdean resort and a caravan were cordoned off while police carried out an investigation in the 100-acre park. 
 North Wales Police urged at the time: 'We would ask the public not to speculate about this incident on social media as this is an active investigation.'
Eyewitnesses reported the air ambulance landed on the A548, which was shut in both directions, at around 3.30pm, with two ambulances and three rapid response vehicles in tow.
A police spokesman said: 'Following an incident at Ty Mawr Holiday Park, Towyn, on Saturday afternoon, 19-year-old Matthew Selby from the Greater Manchester area has this afternoon been charged with murder'.
Mother of two Carly Hargreaves, 44, who arrived on holiday from Manchester, said about eight police cars, three ambulances and the air ambulance arrived to the park.
She said from outside the vast caravan and campsite: 'We are staying two rows behind where it happened and didn't hear a single thing.'",-2
59,"Prince Charles has today been forced to cancel his visit to the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier as the Royal Navy scrambles to find a missing £100million fighter jet before the Russians after it crashed into the sea seconds after take-off.
The ship, which is off the coast of Egypt where Charles and Camilla are on tour, is currently circling an area of the Mediterranean as they try to find and recover F-35B Lightning II plane from sea bed.
The heir to the throne, who was in Cairo today and yesterday visited the The Great Sphinx with his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, had been due to helicopter on to the HMS Queen Elizabeth today but the visit has now been stopped for 'operational reasons'  by the Ministry of Defence. 
The couple will return home from their four-day trip to the Middle East this afternoon, as planned.
It came as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace admitted that Russian aircraft have been tracking the aircraft but would not be drawn on whether Moscow's submarines are in the Med also looking for the wreckage.
He said: 'It is not a secret the Russians have been very interested in the carrier group both on the way out from the United Kingdom - as she's sailed and her group towards the Pacific - and now she is back in the Mediterranean. Of course the Russians are playing close attention - it is what I'd expect'. 
Former soldier Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Select Committee, said he had 'many questions' about the crash. A Clarence House spokesman said: 'For operational reasons, the visit to HMS Queen Elizabeth has been cancelled.'
During the visit, Charles was due to meet Commodore Steve Moorhouse, Commander of the Carrier Strike Group, and Captain Ian Feasey, Commanding Officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth.
He was also scheduled to watch the launch of a F35 jet from the flight deck before meeting some of the ship's company including US Navy and Marines. 
The US are understood to be helping with efforts to recover the plane.
Whilst the UK has its own team capable of carrying out the operation, an American team and their machinery is currently nearer to where the accident occurred.
According to navy sources mentioned in The Times, the operation is expected to involve deep water remote-controlled vehicles which will be used to find the F-35 and then attach huge inflatable bags to it so that it rises to the surface on its own.
However, it will have a long way to travel because it is believed to be more than a mile beneath the surface of the Mediterranean.
US-based firm Subsalve produces what it describes as 'underwater lift bags'. 
The firm, which has made bags for the US Navy, lists models on its website which can lift items weighing up to 48tonnes. The F-35 weighs up to 30tonnes when carrying weapons and its pilot
Whilst the aircraft has not yet been found, the US Navy is using device called a TPL-25 towed pinger locator system to find the F-35's emergency relocation pinger.
The TPL-25 system consists of a device which is towed behind a search vessel. It can detect a pinger at depths of up to 20,000feet (3.8miles).
A Royal Navy source added to The Times that whilst the recovery is 'not rocket science', the problem is 'finding and getting' to the aircraft.
The US Navy is also able to make use of winch system called a Flyaway Deep Ocean Salvage System (FADOSS).
A page on the navy's website says the device provides 'reliable deep ocean lifting capacity of up to 60,000 pounds for the recovery of large, bulky, and heavy sunken objects such as aircraft or small vessels.'
In March, the US Navy used the device to lift a Canadian helicopter from the sea.
Jets from the vessel previously participated in strikes against the remnants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
The 65,000-tonne Royal Navy flagship is returning to the UK from its maiden mission, which included exercises with the Indian military.
It was part of the carrier strike group's deployment to the Indo-Pacific amid heightened tensions with China in the region. The jets are operated by the renowned 617 Squadron, also known as the 'Dambusters' squadron.
Charles and Camilla turned royal tourists yesterday. The couple were shown around the breathtaking Pyramids of Giza, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, as their Middle East tour took them to Cairo. 
The couple walked carefully up several steep steps hewn out of the side of the 454ft high pyramid called Khufu – or the Pyramid of Cheops – tomb of a pharaoh. It is made of two million blocks, each weighing 50 tonnes.
Britain has called on the US to help find and salvage a fighter jet that crashed into the Mediterranean after its pilot ejected shortly after take off. Royal Navy servicemen are working with the Americans to recover the F-35B from more than a mile below the surface. 
The UK is believed to have the equipment and manpower to rescue the destroyed £100million aircraft but their Nato allies were reportedly closer. 
The Royal Navy were racing towards the crash site amid fears Russia will try to grab the jet which is packed with top secret technology.
The operation, shrouded in secrecy, is understood to involve divers, miniature submarines and inflatable bags which may be used to lift the plane to the surface of the Mediterranean.  
The US is anxious that the jet's top secret technology is not salvaged by Russia or any of its allies as they would want to study the stealth technology closely to find a way of defeating the jet. 
Former President Donald Trump blocked the transfer of four F-35A jets to Turkey after Ankara said it was going to by a Russian missile defence system. 
The Pentagon did not want Russian technicians from studying the attack jet's radar profile or looking at its technology.  
An RAF pilot was forced to eject from his jet as it plunged into the sea soon after taking off on 'routine exercise' from the Navy's flagship aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, yesterday.
After he ejected, the pilot was reportedly left dangling from the edge of the HMS Queen Elizabeth because the lines of his parachute became caught on the edge of the flight deck. 
By plunging into international waters, the crash triggered a scramble to find the next-generation plane before it could be reached by foreign powers. It s thought to be the first time an F35-B has crashed in such an area.
The technology aboard the US-designed aircraft, including top secret radar and sensors, is hugely sensitive as it allows the F-35 to fly 'unseen' in hostile territory at supersonic speeds.
This week's crash raises fresh questions about the F-35B, of which Britain currently has 24. 
 The UK is set to buy 138 of the fighter jets from US aviation giant Lockheed Martin for £9.1billion in the coming years.
In June 2014 a USAF F-35A had a catastrophic engine fire caused by a fractured rotor which saw it turn into a blaze as it took off in Florida. Two years later a USMC F-35B set alight mid-flight due to a fire in its weapons bay.
In 2018, a US F-35B pilot was forced to eject mid-air after the fighter jet crashed in South Carolina during a training exercise.
And last year, an F-35B aircraft crashed near Naval Air Facility El Centro in California after crashing into a KC-130J, US officials told USNI News.
The US are understood to be helping with efforts to recover the plane.
Whilst the UK has its own team capable of carrying out the operation, an American team and their machinery is currently nearer to where the accident occurred.
According to navy sources mentioned in The Times, the operation is expected to involve deep water remote-controlled vehicles which will be used to find the F-35 and then attach huge inflatable bags to it so that it rises to the surface on its own.

In March, the US Navy used the device to lift a Canadian helicopter from the sea.
A Royal Navy source told the Times: 'A number of nations have the capability to recover an aircraft from that depth. We've asked the Americans for help and they have offered.'
They added that the military were yet to pinpoint where the aircraft had gone down and were still gathering the machines needed to recover it. 
Meanwhile Britain are circling the suspected area to ensure the secretive jet does not fall into enemy hands, such as those of Russia, which could salvage it but is not thought to have the equipment nearby.
The source said bringing the plane back to the surface was 'not rocket science' but 'the problem is finding and getting to it — you need a machine that can get to that depth'. 
There are also fears the aircraft may have drifted under the sea to a different area than where they suspect it went down. They added: 'We know the vicinity but we need to find it and attach floating devices to it.'
After he ejected, rockets in his plane's seat blasted him more than 100feet upwards before his parachute opened. 
The unnamed pilot who ejected from the stricken F-35 jet was then left dangling left from the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier which he had taken off from.
Rockets in his plane's seat blasted him more than 100feet upwards before his parachute opened. 
But a source told The Sun that when the pilot floated back down towards the warship, he 'came within inches' of hitting the flight deck. 
Instead, a cross-wind is said to have blown him sideways, where his parachute lines then became snagged on the edge of the 900feet long runway. 
The quick-thinking pilot was then left dangling from the edge of the warship, around 60feet above the water. 
He pulled an escape pin which released him from his harness and he then plunged into the water.   

'He made the right decision,' a source said. 
'We train for landing in water. The last thing you want is to get tangled in your parachute lines getting dragged along the edge of a 65,000 tonne warship.'
A search and rescue helicopter was then used to pluck him out of the water.

As the UK's most advanced and expensive jet, the single-seater can land vertically and only needs a short runway to take off.
It is the first one Britain has lost and the incident is the first mishap for the RAF's F-35B fleet and for the £3billion aircraft carrier which left the UK seven months ago. 
Howard Dyer, a regulatory consultant in aviation, told MailOnline today: 'Military planes do not have to be designed to the same standard as civilian ones because they are not party to international rules.
'Everyone in civilian aviation, apart from a few exceptions, has to follow the same rules. Military plans are made by governments with government people on board so do not have the same restrictions on them.
'If there are any rubbish planes in the sky, they will be military ones. Civilian planes fly over other countries which is why they are held to a higher standard.
'But military ones only usually can with permission or if they are invading, so usually stay over their own country or sea.'
Retired Rear Admiral Chris Parry said last night: 'Although an inquiry will establish the precise cause of the crash, it appears likely that the accident occurred because of engine malfunction.
'Despite the F-35B's good safety record, it was inevitable that some of these high-performance aircraft, which operate in the distinctly demanding maritime environment, would have been lost at some stage.'
In 1966, a USAF B-52G bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed into a KC-135 tanker during mid-air over the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain.
Upon impact, the KC-135 was destroyed and all four crew members aboard were killed. The B-52G broke apart, and three of the seven crew died. 
Meanwhile, the four nuclear bombs fell 31,000 feet to the surface - three of which were found on land near the small fishing village of Palomares in Almeria.
The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons blew up upon impact, resulting in the contamination of a 0.77-sq m area with radioactive plutonium. 
The fourth, which fell into the Mediterranean, was recovered intact after a two-month search.   

The Ministry of Defence insisted last night 'no hostile action' was involved in the crash. Last night, the investigation was focusing on technical or human error. 
The pilot, who suffered minor injuries, is understood to have been rescued by helicopter. The pilot's family was informed of the crash before military chiefs released a statement yesterday afternoon about the incident. 
Having sailed to the Far East and attracted the attention of both Russia and China, the £3billion Queen Elizabeth was last known to have been in the eastern Mediterranean, after leaving Oman. 
The Prince of Wales is due to visit the carrier tomorrow as part of a royal tour to Egypt.
The Lightning is described by the RAF as a fifth generation combat aircraft capable of conducting air-to-surface strikes and electronic warfare. 
The aircraft uses an array of sensors to operate undetected in enemy airspace. There were understood to be not only eight British F-35s aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth but also ten US aircraft. 
They have conducted some 2,000 take-offs and landings without incident. When not deployed on the carrier, the UK's F-35Bs are stationed at RAF Marham in Norfolk as part of 617 Squadron (the 'Dambusters'). In 2020, US military tests found 276 different faults in the jet's combat system.
Last night the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: 'The F-35 ditched soon after take off. We are pleased the pilot is safe and back on board. Our operational and training flights continue.'
The Ministry of Defence said: 'A British F-35 pilot from HMS Queen Elizabeth ejected during routine flying operations in the Mediterranean this morning. 
'The pilot has been safely returned to the ship and an investigation has begun, so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. No other vessels or aircraft were involved.'
A comprehensive military air investigation has been launched by the RAF and US experts.
America enticed its Nato and other allies into sharing the cost of the aircraft by offering input into manufacture and 15 per cent of each one is comprised of parts from British companies while some of the jets will be made in Italy.
But the planes have been plagued by a catalogue of problems which have sent costs soaring.
There are fears about shortcomings in the technical systems underpinning the new generation of war planes will leave them unable to function properly.
The true cost of the British planes delivered this year is estimated to be over £150million each to cover 'extras' such as software upgrades and spare parts. There are also concerns plane's software system is vulnerable to cyber-attack and cannot be tested independently by the UK.
The weak broadband on the Royal Navy's principal aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is also hampering the jet's abilities.
Though the cost of the F-35 has been the focus of attention, there have also been embarrassing reports of operational shortcomings emerging from the United States.
In a mock air battle in 2015, the cutting edge plane was defeated by an older generation F-16, a plane designed in the 1970s.
In 2020 Pentagon tests found 276 different faults in jet's combat system. They included the 25mm cannon vibrating excessively and problems with the he aircraft's 'virtual reality' helmet. Overheating, premature wear of components in the vertical tails and vulnerability to fire were also found to be issues.
The US Air Force temporarily grounded dozens its F-35 stealth fighters while it investigated an oxygen supply issue.
The Marine Corps, who also operate the same F-35B model the UK has purchased, was forced to ground its planes after flaws were found in the  computer system.
The delivery of the RAF's new, US-built F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter in July 2021  marked a rare moment of celebration in what has been a troubled project.
The 'fifth generation' fighter aircraft is the world's most expensive weapons system, though costs have finally stabilised at an eye-watering $406billion.
Manufacturer Lockheed-Martin agreed to cap costs after US President Donald Trump critised the project and even tweeted support for a rival aircraft. 
Britain is currently embarked on a £9.1billion programme to purchase 48 of the F-35s, from American aviation giant Lockheed Martin, by 2025.
America enticed its Nato and other allies into sharing the cost of the aircraft by offering input into manufacture and 15 per cent of each one is comprised of parts from British companies while some of the jets will be made in Italy.
But the planes have been plagued by a catalogue of problems which have sent costs soaring.
There are fears about shortcomings in the technical systems underpinning the new generation of war planes will leave them unable to function properly.
The true cost of the British planes delivered this year is estimated to be over £150million each to cover 'extras' such as software upgrades and spare parts.
There are also concerns plane's software system is vulnerable to cyber-attack and cannot be tested independently by the UK.
The weak broadband on the Royal Navy's principal aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is also hampering the jet's abilities.
The problems are not helped by the department responsible for the computer networks essential to the aircraft's operation needs to find savings of £400 million this year.
The reports into the costs and other problems prompted the Defence Select Committee to launch an inquiry into the project.
It reprimanded the Ministry of Defence for keeping parliament and the public in the dark about the costs.
The MoD has so far refused to provide the estimated cost to the UK of buying the F-35, beyond referring to a National Audit Office which used the £9.1billion figure.
MPs said 'it is simply not acceptable for the MoD to refuse to disclose to parliament and the public its estimates for the total cost of the programme'.
Though the cost of the F-35 has been the focus of attention, there have also been embarrassing reports of operational shortcomings emerging from the United States.
In a mock air battle in 2015, the cutting edge plane was defeated by an older generation F-16, a plane designed in the 1970s.
In 2020 Pentagon tests found 276 different faults in jet's combat system.
They included the 25mm cannon vibrating excessively and problems with the he aircraft's 'virtual reality' helmet

60,"Poppy Day bomber Emad Al Swealmeen's ball bearing-packed explosive may have been accidentally set off when the taxi he used to get to his target suddenly stopped.
Counter-terrorism police confirmed today they believe the 32-year-old's Remembrance Day weapon would have caused 'significant injury or death' if it had gone off outside.
But the fact it detonated inside innocent David Perry's taxi outside Liverpool Women's Hospital, meant only the bomber was killed.
Police also disclosed today that devious Al Swealmeen purchased components from his bomb individually and by using a number of fake names to avoid flagging systems.
They have also ruled out any connection to the horrific Manchester Arena atrocity carried out by jihadi Salman Abedi.
Counter-terror officers are near completing of a full picture of Al Swealmeen's recent state of mind after speaking last night to his brother. 
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Police North West said: 'We continue to make significant progress in relation to the CT incident at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.
'Officers spoke with the brother of Al Swealmeen yesterday evening and this has given us an insight into his early years and an understanding of Al Swealmeen's life and his recent state of mind which is an important line of investigation. We are grateful for members of the public who knew him and have contacted us. 
'Although there is much scientific work to do on the device to determine what made it up, we have learned a great deal over the past five days.
'It was made using homemade explosive and had ball bearings attached to it which would have acted as shrapnel. Had it detonated in different circumstances we believe it would have caused significant injury or death.
'We still do not know how or why the device exploded when it did, but we are not discounting it being completely unintentional, and it is a possibility that the movement of the vehicle or its stopping caused the ignition.
'We are spending considerable time seeking to understand the way the purchases for the ingredients to make the device were made. This is complicated because purchases have spanned many months and Al Swealmeen has used many aliases. We are confident however that in time we will get a full picture of what purchases were made and how, and if anyone else was involved or knew what Al Swealmeen was up to.
'We have found no connection between this incident and the terrible events of Manchester in May 2017. The device was also different to the one used in the Manchester Arena attack.
'The investigation is still moving at a very fast pace and will continue into the weekend and the coming weeks.' 
The Church of England was today accused of aiding asylum seekers to 'game' the immigration system by helping hundreds to convert from Islam and 'pray to stay' in the UK as it emerged people smugglers are using Instagram to urge migrants to follow Jesus to help them gain British citizenship. 
Emad Al Swealmeen lost his first bid to stay in Britain in 2014 but appealed again in 2017 after he worshipped at Liverpool Cathedral and his case was still outstanding when he blew himself up in a taxi on Sunday.
He was baptised and confirmed having apparently spoken 'endlessly and passionately about Jesus', but members of the city's largest Anglican church admitted they 'lost contact' with him within months of the ceremony. He was one of around 200 asylum seekers to adopt the faith there over a four-year period.
A clergyman at Liverpool Cathedral previously raised concerns about asylum seekers cynically posing as Christians to boost their chances of being awarded refugee status. Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian admitted in 2016 that 'plenty of people' were lying about their intentions after it emerged that the Church of England had christened hundreds of asylum seekers under a scheme dubbed 'pray to stay'. 
He said: 'There are many people abusing the system... I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault? And who are they deceiving? The Home Office, me as a pastor, or God?'  
MPs are to demand a ­formal Parliamentary probe into whether fake Christian converts are duping the Church of England to avoid being deported back to strict Muslim countries they came from. 
It came as new statistics revealed that between January 2020 and June this year, 29% of all migrants arriving by boat say they are from Iran and 20% say they are from Iraq. 91% of all migrants came from just 10 countries - including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and Yemen. These are also nations named in the top 20 countries where Christians are the most persecuted for following Jesus. 
Priti Patel said last night that Al Swealmeen, who changed his name to Enzo Almeni shortly after finding Jesus, exploited the UK's asylum 'merry-go-round' while a Home Office source said changing from Islam to Christianity is now 'standard practice' among asylum seekers 'to game the asylum system'.  
Experts believe had the bomb functioned as intended, metal fragments would have been flung in all directions, shredding the car and cutting down passers-by.
Forensic tests are expected to reveal why it failed.
Mr Perry is thought to have escaped serious injury because the blast was largely confined to the back seat before the vehicle erupted in flames.
Early accounts of Mr Perry's bravery suggested he had stopped the taxi after spotting parts of his passenger's device.
The new police theory on the early detonation being triggered by the cab halting means the driver effectively foiled the deadly plot.
Yesterday it emerged that Al Swealmeen, 32, had spent months trawling the internet to buy chemicals and metal components in small quantities to avoid detection.
The failed asylum seeker, who arrived in Britain from Iraq, is said to have had online shopping packages constantly arriving at his rented flat in Liverpool.
Officers have recovered traces of chemicals from the bomb factory indicating that he experimented with various explosives.
One of the recipes he is understood to have followed was for hexamethylene triperoxide diamine – the same material used by the July 7 2005 London bombers.
In previous terror attacks such as the Manchester Arena bombing and the Parsons Green tube explosion, key ingredients were bought on Amazon.
Yesterday, the company said it was checking to see if Al Swealmeen had bought chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide.
An Amazon spokesman said: 'We only sell products that comply with UK laws. In addition, we also continue to work closely with police and law enforcement agencies.'
The motive for the attack remains unclear because officers have yet to access the bomber's computers.
Al Swealmeen had converted to Christianity in Liverpool Cathedral and attended services in the suburb of Fazakerley until 2019. But he later dropped out of sight, according to the leaders of his local church.
Yesterday there were reports suggesting that he had regularly attended a local mosque.
Far-Right extremism has for the first time overtaken Islamism as the main reason for referrals to the Government's anti-radicalisation programme Prevent, say official figures.
It was behind 1,229 referrals, about a quarter of the 4,915 made from April 2020 to March this year.
There were 1,064 about Islamism – 22 per cent. Most of the rest were for individuals with mixed, unstable or unclear ideologies.
The impact of coronavirus curbs led to a 22 per cent drop in referrals to Prevent, the first since records began in 2016. Under-20s account for 48 per cent of cases – and men for 88 per cent.",-2
61,"Azeem Rafiq today insisted anti-Semitic tropes he sent in Facebook messages to a teammate 'do differ' from the racism he suffered for years at Yorkshire as he begged British Jews to forgive him and admitted he 'f***ed up' and 'deserves the flak'.
Mr Rafiq made the offensive remarks about Atif Sheikh, an Asian cricketer who was playing for Derbyshire, who was accused of not paying a dinner bill because 'he is a Jew'.
Rafiq, then 19, wrote on Facebook: 'Hahaha he is a Jew. Probs go after my 2nds again.' He later added: 'How wrong is that? Only Jews do that sort of s**t.'
Yesterday he issued a humbling apology about the Facebook messages a decade ago, and today said sorry again but insisted the 'circumstances do differ' to when he was repeatedly called a 'P*ki' by his Yorkshire teammates.
In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, he said: 'The circumstances do differ. I don't think I've ever played with anyone Jewish, so it was not exactly the same. But I don't want to play it down. I've hurt people. My genuine feeling is that I deserve the flak. I f***ed up.'
But he told the newspaper that his comments were not equivalent to the racist abuse he suffered, pointing out that he had red wine forced into his mouth when his Muslim faith prevented him from drinking booze. 
Rafiq told the JC: 'I'm deeply sorry. I don't recall making any other antisemitic remarks, but I'll go back and think about it. People are going to go through my whole life looking for things I've done. I admit I've made mistakes.' 
Some have questioned claims that his anti-Semitic comments were not equivalent to the racism he suffered.
Piers Morgan tweeted: 'Yorkshire CC’s handling of this scandal, as I said earlier this week, has been shameful', adding: 'Seeing a lot of people tortuously trying to defend/justify/excuse Azeem Rafiq’s anti-Semitism. STOP. His racism is as unacceptable as the racism he exposed. To think or suggest otherwise is just ridiculous hypocrisy'.
Former Derbyshire left-arm bowler Atif Sheikh said Rafiq was wrong to make the ‘anti-Semitic comment’ but said he was young at the time and had called him yesterday to say sorry for any ‘hurt’. 
Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Sheikh said: ‘Azeem was young at the time, everyone makes mistakes. That’s not to excuse what he said because it was an anti-Semitic comment and he shouldn’t have said it but he came out straight away when he was confronted with it and apologised.
‘He and I are friends and still see each other. He phoned yesterday and said “look, I’m really sorry if those comments caused you any hurt”. I accepted his apology and Ateeq has also been in touch to say sorry.
‘What I don’t want to happen is for this to detract in any way from what Azeem went through or the message he is putting out there because what he went through at Yorkshire is much worse.
‘I found it heartbreaking listening to his experiences when it was his dream - and his family’s dream - to play for England.
‘Knowing a good friend went through that much pain has hurt me more than a silly comment he made when he was a teenager. Everyone makes silly comments they later regret in life and while he shouldn’t have made them, he came out straight away, owned it and said sorry.
‘I think there are people who he has mentioned who should take a leaf out his book and apologise to him.’
Mr Sheikh, 30, who is now coaching for Nottingham in the International Cricket Masters, said he could not remember the dinner bill in question and said: ‘I don’t think we’d even gone out for dinner, myself, Azeem and Ateeq. If I remember the comments came when we were away with England and I think they were making an ill-judged joke.’  
Ex-England cricket star Alex Hales today apologised for 'blacking up' to impersonate Tupac Shakur at a 2009 New Year's Eve party as the ECB and his county launched probes into the photo and whether he gave his black dog a racist name.  
The England and Wales Cricket Board and Nottinghamshire will speak to the batsman about the newly-unearthed picture showing Hales, 32, posing as the late rapper at the bash having painted his skin a dark colour.
Hales, who is also in trouble after being accused by Azeem Rafiq of calling his black dog 'Kevin' due to cricketer Gary Ballance's use of the name as a derogatory term for people of colour, insisted that he had dressed up in tribute to his 'favourite musician' US rapper Tupac Shakur for the party.
The batsman, who is currently in Australia preparing for the Big Bash with Sydney Thunder, also denies the allegation regarding his dog and in a video statement posted on Instagram addressed the issue of the 2009 event.
'The theme was musicians and Tupac (Shakur) is, was and always will be my favourite musician so I went as him,' he said.
'Obviously I realise this is incredibly disrespectful and I want to apologise for the offence this has no doubt caused.
'It was incredibly reckless and foolish on my behalf and I apologise for that, and apologise to the club for the embarrassment it would have caused them. I deplore all forms of racism and discrimination.'
The ECB said today it will 'investigate accordingly' after the picture was published by The Sun. His English county team Nottinghamshire, who are already probing the naming of his dog 'Kevin', said the club has 'extended the scope of their investigation into the historic conduct of Alex Hales following the publication of a photograph taken in 2009'. 
 
Fighting back tears he told MPs this week that racism had seeped into the England dressing room, where it was an 'open secret' that his abuser Gary Ballance used the word 'Kevin' as a derogatory word for black and Asian players, an allegation Ballance has denied. Rafiq added that England batsman Alex Hales allegedly named his dog Kevin because it was black. Hales strongly denied the claims. 
The former Yorkshire spin bowler, 30, rocked the world of sport with allegations of racism in cricket at a damning parliamentary session on Tuesday. 
Rafiq told MPs this week that racism had destroyed his career and pointed the finger at a number of high-profile individuals, but he has now been forced to confront his own past shortcomings after The Times uncovered an exchange in 2011 with former Warwickshire and Leicestershire player Ateeq Javid. 
Speaking to MailOnline, Rafiq admitted: 'I spoke to Atif today and apologised to him for what I said. He was very understanding. I told I'm I was incredibly sorry as I am to all those who may have been offended. I spoke to Atif on the phone and he accepted my apology.' 
In a statement on Twitter yesterday, Rafiq apologised for his past remarks, saying he has deleted the exchange and that he is a 'different person today'.
He said: 'I was sent an image of this exchange from early 2011 today. I have gone back to check my account and it is me. I have absolutely no excuses. I am ashamed of this exchange and have now deleted it so as not to cause further offence. 
'I was 19 at the time and I hope and believe I am a different person today. I am incredibly angry at myself and I apologise to the Jewish community and everyone who is rightly offended by this.'
In a later post, he added: 'At no point will I ever try and defend the indefensible. For those I have hurt I am sincerely sorry. I will continue to front up and own any more mistakes I have made.' 
Reacting to Rafiq's anti-Semitic slurs, Board of Deputies of British Jews President Marie van der Zyl said: 'Azeem Rafiq has suffered terribly at the hands of racists in cricket so he will well understand the hurt this exchange will cause to Jews who have supported him. 
'His apology certainly seems heartfelt and we have no reason to believe he is not completely sincere.' 
Claudia Mendoza, co-chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, added: 'There's no doubt that this is massively awkward for Azeem Rafiq but he's taken full ownership, apologised, and undoubtedly - through his own experiences - learnt a lot about racism since then.' 
The revelation comes after MPs today warned the England and Wales Cricket Board to get its house in order over 'institutional racism' in the sport following Rafiq's appearance.
In shocking testimony, Rafiq broke down in tears as he made racial discrimination claims against Tim Bresnan, Matthew Hoggard, Alex Hales, Gary Ballance and David 'Bumble' Lloyd. The spin bowler turned racism whistleblower also claimed the word P*** was 'used constantly' during his time at Yorkshire CCC as he gave explosive testimony to MPs.
In one shocking claim, he gave a harrowing account of having red wine forced down his throat by older players at his local team when he was 15 and a devout Muslim - before he drank more heavily from 2012 'to try to fit in'. 
Rafiq claimed when he first joined Yorkshire he and other Asian players were told they had to 'sit near the toilets' and were called 'elephant washers'. He also launched another broadside at former teammate Ballance, saying it was an open secret in the England dressing room he was racist.
The spin bowler also claimed Alex Hales named his black Dobermann 'Kevin' after his friend Ballance used it to refer to black people. And he hit out at current England Test captain Joe Root, claiming the batsman was on the nights out when he was called a 'P***'. 
During the wide-ranging hearing, Rafiq blinked back tears as he opened up about the 'inhumane' treatment he received from coaches after his wife had a miscarriage in 2017.
His emotional testimony had to be brought to an abrupt halt by DCMS chair Julian Knight and adjourned for five minutes so the cricketer could recompose himself.  

Rafiq said he started medication due to his deteriorating mental health and left Yorkshire for the first time in 2014. When he returned he initially felt settled under captain Alex Lees and coach Jason Gillespie.
'Jason left in 2016 and it just felt the temperature in the room had been turned up,' Rafiq said. 'You had Andrew Gale coming in as coach and Gary Ballance as captain. For the first time I started to see for what it was - I felt isolated, humiliated at times. Constant use of the word 'P***'.'
Rafiq said on a 2017 pre-season tour Ballance had racially abused him. 'We were in a place and Gary Ballance walks over and goes, 'Why are you talking to him? You know he's a P***'. This happened in front of team-mates. It happened in front of coaching staff.'
He added: 'He would constantly talk down to me and make racist jokes, designed to undermine me and make me feel small, like coming up and interrupting when I was talking to girls in a club, saying 'don't talk to him, he's a P***'. I remember crying outside a nightclub after his constant racist taunting.
'On those bus trips, he would look out for corner shops and make comments like 'does your dad own these?' Gary would often make comments like this on YCCC [Yorkshire County Cricket Club] bus trips, in the dressing room, or at events — and in front of YCCC coaches, staff and management, including our coach, Andrew Gale, [the coach] Richard Pyrah, director of cricket Martyn Moxon, and club president Dickie Bird. But nothing was said or done to stop it. Instead, they often laughed along.'

Ballance admitted using a 'racial slur' towards Rafiq in a lengthy statement this month, apologising but framing it as part of their friendship. Rafiq told the committee that was not an accurate depiction of their relationship, saying it went downhill from 2013 onwards and had become toxic by 2017.

Rafiq also alleged former England batter Alex Hales was involved, saying: 'Gary and Alex Hales got really close to each other when they played for England together. I wasn't present in that dressing room, but what I understand (is) that Alex went on to name his dog 'Kevin' because it was black. It's disgusting how much of a joke it was.'
Asked about Vaughan, Rafiq said: 'Michael might not remember it... three of us, Adil, myself and Rana remember it.
'He clearly had a snippet of my statement. He used his platform at the Daily Telegraph to tell everyone he hadn't said these things. To go on and put a snippet of my statement out and talk about other things, I thought was completely wrong. He probably doesn't remember it because it doesn't mean anything to him.'
Rafiq make claims over the former England player's behaviour at the club, saying he was among 'six or seven' players to have made a bullying complaint against the star in 2017. But he added that he was the only one of those players who was of colour.
He said: 'Tim is Andrew's [Gale's] brother-in-law. They always supported each other. Tim would tag along and join in with Andrew's racist comments and they bounced off each other in terms of the bullying. As with Andrew, Tim frequently made racist comments and was unduly harsh towards me compared to white British players, which became so unbearable that I made a formal complaint against him in 2017.'
Rafiq said: 'It was Hoggy who started calling me 'Raffa the Kaffir'. It was only later I realised what 'Kaffir' meant, how it was used, and that it was a racist term. Comments from Hoggy towards myself and the other Asian players — Adil, Ajmal and Rana — were constant.
'He might have thought it was just dressing room banter, but we would come in in the morning and he would say things like 'you lot sit over there' and make us all sit together. He would also call us things like 'elephant washers' and 'P***'. Rafiq said Matthew Hoggard apologised to him after watching him being interviewed about his experience at Yorkshire.
He said: 'I took a phone call from Matthew and he just said, 'Look, I didn't realise, I'm really sorry. If some of the comments I made made you feel the way you've described it, I just want to apologise'. You know what, when someone does that, I was like, 'Thank you, I really appreciate it'.'
Rafiq said he found it 'hurtful' England captain Root said he had never witnessed anything of a racist nature at Yorkshire. 'Rooty is a good man. He never engaged in racist language,' Rafiq said.
'I found it hurtful because Rooty was Gary (Ballance)'s housemate and had been involved in a lot of the socialising where I was called a 'P***'. It shows how normal it was that even a good man like him doesn't see it for what it was. It's not going to affect Joe, but it's something I remember every day.'
Rafiq claimed: 'There were denial, briefings, cover-ups, smearing, high-profile media people messaging other members of the media who supported me saying stuff like 'the clubhouse is the lifeblood of a club and Asian players don't go in there', and 'getting subs out of Asian players is like getting blood out of a stone'.
'And then personally, this guy doesn't even know me, has never spent any time with me, talking about my personal drinking, going out and socialising. That was David Lloyd, he's been an England coach, commentator and I found it disturbing. Within a week of me speaking out that's what I got sent to me, and I thought, 'God, there's some closet racists and we need to do something about it'.'
Rafiq claimed Jack Brooks, a two-time County Championship winner at Yorkshire, had started the disrespectful practice of calling India star Cheteshwar Pujara 'Steve' during an overseas stint at the club.
The spin bowler also warned that 'hundreds and thousands' of cricketers could now come forward with their own racism claims - claiming there will be an opening of the 'floodgates' where victims of alleged abuse fight back. 
In a devastating 90-minute testimony to a Commons committee, Rafiq recalled his 'inhuman' treatment at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and accused senior players of racist bullying.
The 30-year-old said the word 'P***' was 'used constantly' in his time on the Yorkshire first team - and that racism continues to be rife in county teams across the country.
At one point the hearing had to be halted as Rafiq broke down in tears describing his treatment after he lost his unborn child, with a senior official 'ripping the shreds' off him instead of offering support.
The cricketer was giving evidence to MPs after a report earlier this year found he was a victim of 'racial harassment and bullying' but the club said they would not discipline anyone. The remarks have also been dismissed by other players as 'banter'.
In his highly emotional account Rafiq said he had lost his career to racism after making an official complaint about bullying, but hoped that by speaking out he could change the game. 
He told how, aged 15 and a practising Muslim, he was 'pinned down' and had red wine poured down his throat by a senior player at his local cricket club.  
Rafiq also criticised other players not directly involved in racist behaviour for failing to recognise the damaging culture and doing nothing to stamp it out.
They included England test captain Joe Root - described by Rafiq as 'a good man' - who was present when racist slurs were made.
He said problems began with Yorkshire CCC's hierarchy when he was labelled a troublemaker for complaining about bullying by a teammate. It came to a head in his treatment by cricket director Martyn Moxon during his wife's difficult pregnancy, which ended in the unborn child dying.
Choking back tears, the father of two said: 'My first day back after losing my son Martyn Moxon literally got me in a room and ripped the shreds off me. I've never seen him speak to anyone like that through my time at the club and I couldn't believe it.'
Decision-makers are braced for a testing day on Friday, as the England and Wales Cricket Board takes part in a game-wide meeting at The Oval. 
The governing body's handling of the ongoing racism crisis, set in train by Rafiq's allegations against Yorkshire but seemingly spreading wider by the day, is likely to attract major criticism.
The chairs of the 18 first-class counties will meet, joined by representatives of the 21 non-first class cricket boards, the national counties cricket association and the MCC, and it is understood there is some disquiet about the glacial pace and hands-off manner the scandal has been dealt with.
ECB chief executive Tom Harrison is also expected to come under fire from some in attendance, following his unheralded appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee shortly after Rafiq.
With the ECB already operating under an interim chair, Barry O'Brien, due to Ian Watmore's recent departure, Harrison will be hoping he can restore confidence in his leadership of a game which has been in a near constant state of emergency since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
Cricket governance also remains on the agenda at Westminster, with sports minister Nigel Huddleston raising the prospect of an independent regulator should the current ECB regime fail to deliver on the issue of racism.
Speaking to the DCMS select committee which had interviewed both Rafiq and Harrison, he said: 'With cricket, I'd say the clock's ticking on this, we might well go down that route as well.
'We've had very frank conversations with ECB and others involved in cricket over the last couple of weeks. I have had reassurance that they take the issue seriously and will act.
'Tom Harrison has promised me that with every fibre of his being he will take action here. He knows he needs to act quickly. We will judge them on their deeds and not their words, and if they fail to act appropriately we will not hesitate to intervene further.'
Rafiq mentioned Lloyd during his evidence to MPs as an example of the 'denial, briefings, cover-up, smearing' that he alleged took place after he went public with his racism complaints against Yorkshire.
He said: 'High-profile media people messaging other members of the media who supported me saying stuff like, 'The club houses are the life blood of a club and Asian players don't go in there', 'Getting subs out of Asian players is like getting blood out of stone'.
'And then personally this guy is talking about my personal drinking, going out and socialising. That was David Lloyd.'
Rafiq also told the DCMS: 'Pretty early on at the club, I joined a dressing room full of my heroes, Michael Vaughan, Matthew Hoggard, part of the 2005 Ashes team. And it was just the most surreal moment for me.
'Pretty early on, me and other people from an Asian background...there were comments such as 'you'll sit over there near the toilets', 'elephant washers'.
'The word P*** was used constantly. And there just seemed to be an acceptance in the institution from the leaders and no one ever stamped it out.'
Rafiq added: 'All I wanted to do is play cricket and play for England and live my dream and live my family's dream.'
He added: 'In my first spell, I don't really think I quite realised what it was. I think I was in denial.'
He said he started medication due to his deteriorating mental health and left Yorkshire for the first time in 2014.
When he returned he initially felt settled under captain Alex Lees and coach Jason Gillespie.
'Jason left in 2016 and it just felt the temperature in the room had been turned up,' Rafiq said. 'You had Andrew Gale coming in as coach and Gary Ballance as captain.
'For the first time I started to see for what it was - I felt isolated, humiliated at times. Constant use of the word 'P***'.' 
2008-2018: Azeem Rafiq spends 10 years at Yorkshire CCC, becoming their youngest-ever captain and first of Asian origin in 2012.
September 2020: Yorkshire launch investigation as Rafiq reveals that 'deep-rooted' racism at the club left him 'close to committing suicide'. 'I would regularly come home from training and cry all day,' he said. Accusations included people saying there was 'too many of you lot' referring to Rafiq and Asian team-mates.
December 2020: Rafiq files legal claim against the county, claiming he suffered 'direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of his efforts to address racism at the club'.
June 2021: Report is delayed and Rafiq's lawyer says the pushbacks 'create a lack of faith in the entire process'. Employment tribunal is held but parties fail to resolve the dispute.
August 2021: Yorkshire issue 'profound apologies' to Rafiq as report finds he was 'the victim of inappropriate behaviour'. But they do not accept the claim of institutional racism - Rafiq accuses the county of 'fudging' his claims and promised he was 'not going away'.
September 2021: ECB are 'very concerned' with the summary of the panel's findings, with Yorkshire admitting Rafiq was the victim of 'racial harassment and bullying'. 
But just seven of the 43 allegations made are upheld, with Yorkshire saying they do not intend to publish a full report.
October 2021: Yorkshire say they will not take disciplinary action against any of its employees following the report. Rafiq writes on Twitter that the club is 'embarrassing', saying it gives a 'green light' to racism.
Last week: Details of the report are published by ESPNcricinfo, including a senior player's admission that he repeatedly used the word 'P***' in reference to Rafiq, which was deemed 'banter'. Health secretary Sajid Javid said 'heads should roll', with the Prime Minister asking the ECB to investigate. 
Last week: MailOnline reveals the player was Rafiq's former Yorkshire team-mate, England batsman Gary Ballance. Sponsors Anchor Butter, Yorkshire Tea and Emerald all cut ties with the club.
Rafiq said on a 2017 pre-season tour Ballance had racially abused him.
'We were in a place and Gary Ballance walks over and goes, 'Why are you talking to him?
'You know he's a P***'. This happened in front of team-mates. It happened in front of coaching staff.' 
Former England batter Ballance admitted using a 'racial slur' towards Rafiq in a lengthy statement this month, apologising but framing it as part of their friendship.
Rafiq told the committee that was not an accurate depiction of their relationship, saying it went downhill from 2013 onwards and had become toxic by 2017.
Asked by chair Mr Knight about the term 'Kevin', he said it was an offensive, racist term that reached the very top of the game.
'Kevin was a something Gary used to describe anyone of colour in a very derogatory manner. It was an open secret in the England dressing room,' he said.
'Anyone who came across Gary would know that was a phrase he would use to describe people of colour.'
Rafiq also alleged former England batter Alex Hales was involved, saying: 'Gary and Alex Hales got really close to each other when they played for England together.
'I wasn't present in that dressing room, but what I understand (is) that Alex went on to name his dog 'Kevin' because it was black. It's disgusting how much of a joke it was.'
Rafiq, who is a Muslim, also described his harrowing first experience of alcohol at the age of 15. 'I got pinned down at my local cricket club and had red wine poured down my throat, literally down my throat,' he said.
'The player played for Yorkshire and Hampshire. I (then) didn't touch alcohol until about 2012 and around that time I felt I had to do that to fit in.
'I wasn't perfect, there are things I did which I felt I had to do to achieve my dreams. I deeply regret that but it has nothing to do with racism.
'When I spoke I should have been listened to. The game as a whole has a problem, with listening to the victim. There is no 'yeah, but' with racism; there is no 'two sides' to racism.'
Rafiq said the problem at Yorkshire was replicated 'up and down the country'.
Asked about the fact others, such as former Essex and Northamptonshire player Maurice Chambers, had now spoken out, Rafiq said: 'I would like to see it as progress that people are feeling like they can come forward and they are going to be heard and not just be discredited, smeared about, briefed about.'
He described England and Wales Cricket Board initiatives on diversity as 'box-ticking' exercises and 'tokenism'. He said former England coach David 'Bumble' Lloyd had talked about Rafiq's drinking.
He added: 'He'd been an England coach and commentator and I found it disturbing, because Sky is supposedly doing this amazing work on bringing racism to the front and within a week of me speaking out, that's what I got sent to me and I thought, 'God, there are some closet racists and I need to do something about it'.'
Rafiq added: 'I think with four or five months left on my contract, I was encouraged to sign a confidentiality form and take a parcel of money which I refused.
'At that time it would have been a lot of money for me. I think my wife was struggling. I knew I was struggling. 
'There was no way mentally I could have even considered putting myself through this trauma. I actually left the country. I went to Pakistan. I never wanted to come back.'
Asked how he had summoned the strength to come forward, Rafiq added: 'I had an interview about my new business. I got asked a question. And I got emotional. I said everything.
'Even at that point, I genuinely thought that there might be some humanity left in some of these individuals. But no. They thought, 'He hasn't talked about Yorkshire'.
'It was all about 'discredit, discredit, discredit'. I don't know how I've done it. This last 14 months has been incredibly difficult.' The committee took a break as Rafiq became visibly emotional.
After the committee took a break as Rafiq became visibly emotional, Rafiq said he found it 'hurtful' England captain Root said he had never witnessed anything of a racist nature at Yorkshire.
'Rooty is a good man. He never engaged in racist language,' Rafiq said.
'I found it hurtful because Rooty was Gary (Ballance)'s housemate and had been involved in a lot of the socialising where I was called a 'P***'.
'It shows how normal it was that even a good man like him doesn't see it for what it was. It's not going to affect Joe, but it's something I remember every day.'",-2
62,"The multimillionaire founder of a software company that employs Princess Beatrice stepped down last night after a female member of staff accused him of attacking her in harrowing testimony to the US Congress. 
Beatrice is now facing calls to follow David Cameron - who has quit as an adviser to the firm - and resign from her role as vice president of strategy and partnerships after the allegations emerged.
Prince Andrew’s eldest daughter, 33, is vice president of strategy and partnerships at Afiniti, where boss Zia Chisti, 50, has been accused of pressuring a female employee into sex, and allegedly beating her during a sexual encounter.
Former employee Tatiana Spottiswoode, 28, has claimed that Mr Chishti effectively groomed her when she was 21 and then pressured her into sex and assaulted her, leaving her with cuts and bruises and symptoms of concussion.
She gave evidence about the alleged attack to the US Congress and submitted photographs of her injuries.
In a statement last night an Afiniti spokesman said: ‘The Board of Directors of Afiniti, Ltd. (“Afiniti”) announces that Mr. Zia Chishti has stepped down from his role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Director of Afiniti, effective immediately. The Board will make additional organizational announcements in the coming days.’
Earlier an Afiniti spokesman said Mr Chishti ‘strongly disputes all accusations against him’.
David Cameron announced he would leave his role with the firm immediately after learning of the accusations against Mr Chishti, despite the entrepreneur’s denial of the allegations.
Mr Cameron joined the company’s advisory board in 2019, two years after the alleged assault against Miss Spottiswoode and his spokesman said he had ‘absolutely no knowledge’ of the allegations until her evidence to the US Congress committee on Tuesday.
Several major businesses have also said they will review their involvement with the firm.
Afiniti, which provides artificial intelligence technology for call centres, was founded by multimillionaire entrepreneur Mr Chishti in 2005 and has its headquarters in Bermuda, a tax haven.
Ms Spottiswoode said she met Mr Chishti - who was listed among the top 50 bachelors in America by People Magazine in 2001 - when she was 12 or 13, and met him again when she was a student at Columbia Law School.
She told the committee: 'When I was in my senior year of college, in December 2014, Chishti, who was 43 at the time, invited me on a ski trip. I was 21. 
'I initially declined, but he insisted he wanted me to meet his nephew, who also studied philosophy. So I agreed. I later learned that the nephew, who never showed up, didn't exist.'
'The trip was designed to groom me. Chishti told me he had feelings and showed me an extravagant lifestyle.'
Ms Spottiswoode said she rejected him, but eventually dated him about five times over ten weeks before eventually breaking off the relationship.
She continued: 'Months later, Chishti encouraged me to join his company. He presented a rosy picture of a great career opportunity. I believed him. Chishti told me he did not expect a sexual relationship.'
When Ms Spottiswoode joined his company in 2016, she said she signed a contract that included an arbitration agreement with a 'strong confidentiality clause'.
She went on to describe a toxic work environment, saying he 'ocellated between pressurising me for sex and punishing me'.
'During a work meeting in Dubai, he put his hands under my pants and grabbed my but in front of co-workers,' she said.
Ms Spottiswoode went on to describe another work trip to Brazil.
'I avoided him as much as I could, but was under increasing pressure from him. I began to worry that, in addition to wanting sex, Chishti wanted to hurt me and punish me for rejecting him,' she said.
'I felt completely trapped and hopeless. I was 23 and very far from home.
'I didn't want to lose my job, I didn't want him to get any angrier, I did not feel that anyone would protect me and I was too tired to argue with him anymore. I went to his room where he beat me while having sex with me.
'I told him he was hurting me, he said, ''Good''. He told me he should've had sex with me when we first met, when I was 13-years-old.
'I hid in my hotel room until my flight the next day. My body was covered with scratches, cuts, and contusions.
'I had bruises around my neck that looked like I had been strangled, a large bump on my head, and a black eye. A nurse at the hospital said I had the symptoms of a concussion.' 
Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, the founder of the Centre for Women’s Justice, had said Mr Chishti should ‘consider his position’ and that executives such as Princess Beatrice should do the same.
Former England rugby star Will Greenwood, Prince Harry’s friend Thomas Inskip and Winston Churchill’s great-grandson Archie Soames are also employed by the company and board members include former Spanish prime minister José María Aznar and Australian banker Rob Rankin.
Princess Beatrice splits her time between Britain and the US in her role for the firm, and has represented the company at major events such as the annual meeting of world leaders in Davos.
She is currently on maternity leave but has previously described the business as being ‘on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence’ and praised it for ‘working to build a little bit more of a community’ in the technology industry.
Her father Prince Andrew is currently facing a civil lawsuit over separate sexual abuse allegations in the US, related to his friendship to shamed financier Jeffrey Epstein. He denies any wrongdoing.",-2
63,"Drivers will soon face £200 fines and six points on their licence if they so much as touch their phone while at the wheel, ministers announced last night.
Tougher laws taking effect early next year will make phone use while driving illegal in almost all circumstances.
Touching the screen to scroll a music playlist, browse the internet, take a photograph or play a mobile game will all be covered by a ban early next year.
The stringent rules will also apply when stopped at a red light or stuck in traffic.
The only significant exception is that drivers will still be able to use their phone as a sat-nav as long as it is secured in a holder, and hands-free calls. Mobile payments at drive-through restaurants or on toll roads will also be allowed.
But motorists performing one of these actions could still be prosecuted if the police find them not in proper control of their vehicle.
The changes strengthen existing laws which prohibit texting or calling while driving.
The move was first announced last year, but then delayed. Ministers announced last night that it will now happen early next year, with the Highway Code also updated.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes would make it easier to prosecute drivers who ignore the rules. ‘Too many deaths and injuries occur whilst mobile phones are being held,’ he said.
‘By making it easier to prosecute people illegally using their phone at the wheel, we are ensuring the law is brought into the 21st century while further protecting all road users.
‘While our roads remain among the safest in the world, we will continue working tirelessly to make them safer, including through our award-winning THINK! campaign, which challenges social norms among high-risk drivers.’
The Daily Mail’s End The Mobile Madness campaign has called for tougher penalties for drivers who recklessly put the lives of others at risk by using their phones.
Plans for a blanket ban on using mobiles while driving were first mooted two years ago. Following a public consultation which found 81 per cent of people in favour, the legislation has been fine-tuned to include the small number of exceptions. 
The Highway Code will explain the new rules and make it clear that using a phone even in stationary traffic is illegal.
Exemptions will apply for calling emergency services where it is not possible to stop, and for remote-controlled parking functions.
Highways England has trialled the use of high-definition cameras that can take pictures of motorists through their windscreens.
In theory, these could be fitted to overhead gantries with offending drivers sent prosecution notices in the same way as speeding tickets. But there is no sign so far of this being rolled out.
Mary Williams, chief executive of road safety charity Brake, called the announcement, which coincides with Road Safety Week, ‘very welcome’. She added: ‘Driver distraction can be deadly and using a hand-held phone at the wheel is never worth the risk.
‘This news is particularly welcomed by families suffering bereavement and catastrophic injury due to drivers being distracted by phones.’
AA president Edmund King said: ‘By making mobile phone use as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, we are taking big steps to make our roads safer.
‘For years, the AA has campaigned hard and helped educate drivers to the dangers from bad mobile phone use.
‘To help ensure drivers get the message, we also need more cops in cars to help catch and deter those still tempted to pick up.’ ",-2
64,"A school which sparked outrage by cancelling Winston Churchill and JK Rowling for not being diverse insisted the change was 'led by pupils' as it begged parents 'Hope you will support us'. 
Holy Trinity Church of England Primary School in Richmond previously had houses named after the Prime Minister and the Harry Potter author - alongside Sir David Attenborough and Emmeline Pankhurst.
The school - which caters for young children aged three to 11 - claims pupils had asked for the house names to be more diverse. 
It then replaced Churchill and Rowling with England star Marcus Rashford and nurse Mary Seacole.
After MailOnline broke the story, school chair of governors Michele Marcus desperately tried to shore up backing from mothers and father of pupils.
In a newsletter today she urged: 'The change was entirely driven and led by our pupils and they feel proud of having effected this change and knowing their views were heard.
'There may be further interest in the subject and I hope you will support the school in our position.' 
The school, whose headteacher is Alison Bateman, timed the announcement of the changes to coincide with Black History Month in October.
While some are happy with the recognition of school meals campaigner Rashford and Crimean War lifesaver Seacole, parents think the school decided to cancel Churchill and Rowling because they are deemed controversial figures.  
Earlier in the day one parent told MailOnline:  'A lot of us are quite shocked that the school authorities have decided that the contributions of Churchill and Rowling deserve to be erased from the records without so much as a consultation with parents.
'Presumably this has happened party due to the supposed thoughtcrimes committed by these two national figures. For context, the other two – unchanged - house names are 'Pankhurst' and 'Attenborough'.
'I am not alone in feeling appalled that this cowardly action has been taken.'
Churchill - voted the Greatest ever Briton in previous national polls - has recently been accused of racism over his alleged inaction in the 1943 Bengal Famine in India and views on Indian independence.
Rowling has been accused of transphobia after commenting on an online article about 'people who menstruate', questioning why they were not just called 'women'. 
Members of the school's Junior Leadership Team drew up a list of names for possible replacements, which the children then voted on.
The school - which is affiliated to the Diocese of Southwark - announced the changes in a recent newsletter.
It said: 'The children across school have been keen to change some of the names of the school houses to be more diverse.
'The JLT compiled a shortlist and the children have been involved in voting.
'We are pleased to be able to announce the name changes during Black History Month. Churchill has been replaced by Rashford and Rowling by Seacole.'
MailOnline contacted the school to ask why Churchill and Rowling had been selected for replacement and by whom.
It was also asked which other names were on the shortlist and whether the diocese was consulted over the changes.
Head teacher Ms Bateman said: 'The changing of our school's house names was an activity that our children began discussing last year as they did not feel the names reflected the diverse community of our school.
'There was much discussion in classrooms before children voted for the names they wanted to change, and then the new names they wanted to use. 
Mary Seacole is regarded as the greatest black Briton, a woman who did more to advance the cause of nursing - and race relations - than almost any other individual.
On the bloody battlefields of the Crimea, she is said to have saved the lives of countless wounded soldiers, and nursed them back to health in a clinic she paid for out of her own pocket.
But some historians have long complained that she has become almost as famous as that other nursing heroine, Florence Nightingale.
For decades after her death in 1881, Seacole's story was largely overlooked, but for the past 15 years, her reputation and exploits have undergone a remarkable rehabilitation.
Every schoolchild is taught about her achievements, she is a statutory part of the National Curriculum, and for many, she is seen as a secular saint.
Numerous schools, hospitals and universities have rooms or buildings named after her, and shortly she will get her greatest tribute yet: an 8ft tall bronze statue was erected to her memory in the grounds of St Thomas's Hospital, facing towards the Houses of Parliament.
'It is important to us that we reflect what is important to our pupils and their families, not just through their learning, but in the environment they learn in. It is important that childrens' voices are heard and this is why we supported their choice to have our house names reflect diversity, equality and the environment.
'We have a lot of support from parents, some of whom have themselves challenged us in the past about the lack of diversity in the names. We also have the full support of our Governors and the Diocese of Southwark.'
Churchill and Rowling have been victims of cancel culture among a number of organisations for the past few years.
In September Downing Street condemned the 'absurd airbrushing' of Sir Winston's full name from the charity set up in his memory and urged its bosses to reverse the decision also branded 'ridiculous' and 're-writing history'.
The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust removed pictures of the wartime leader from its website and is changing its name to the Churchill Fellowship.
It also started carrying a statement on its website calling the wartime PM's views on race 'unacceptable today, a view that we share'. 
Loyal volunteers at the trust said it was 'rewriting history' and pointed out the former prime minister has frequently been voted the greatest Briton of all time.
One said: 'It beggars belief that the man who saved this nation in our darkest hour finds himself cancelled in this way.' 
Yesterday it was announced the cast and crew of the Harry Potter movies were coming together for a reunion, without the author, JK Rowling.
HBO Max announced on Tuesday it would bring together the cast members from all eight Harry Potter films for a retrospective special entitled Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return To Hogwarts. 
The release said it would feature stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint - who have not made a public appearance together since the premiere of the last premiere of the franchise, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2, in July 2011, as well as filmmaker Chris Columbus, who directed the blockbuster film. 
But the release does not mention the person responsible for the creation of the characters, author JK Rowling, who has been criticised for her views on transgender people.
She had been accused of transphobia after saying that only women can menstruate.",-2
65,"The Imperial War Museum has apologised for a ‘woke’ rap which it staged at the end of the two-minute silence on Remembrance Day, described as ‘a vile attack on Churchill and a rant about race’.
According to witnesses, members of the public walked out in disgust during the performance by a youth music group funded by the Arts Council in the Museum’s foyer on November 11.
The taxpayer-supported museum in Southwark, south London billed ‘Breaking the Silence’ as ‘a spoken word performances and original music’ by the Midi Music Company, based in Deptford, south-east London.
But as the visitors stood respectfully to honour the war dead, they were shocked to hear the words of the performers at the end of the two-minute silence.
One Tripadvisor review from ‘The Savill family’ said: ‘The entire event became horrendous with the inclusion of a Rap which was nothing more than a vile attack on (among others) Churchill and a rant about race.
‘Both are legitimate subjects for debate, but NOT on Remembrance Sunday. My wife who served in the RAF was deeply upset by such a disrespectful charade.
‘We spoke to a member of the staff who was clearly as shocked as we were and said they would pass on our reactions.
‘We left without viewing the exhibition. The whole episode making us question the wisdom of the organisers.’
Another source told MailOnline that the rap contained references to 'white privilege and how racist Britain is – some of the staff there are incredibly embarrassed about it.’
The Imperial War Museum sent MailOnline a statement containing its apology.
The statement said: ‘For four years, we have offered a platform for the voices of 11 – 18 year olds to engage with our collections and share their perspectives on war and conflict.
‘Presenting the cause, course and consequence of war from the First World War to the present day, IWM’s challenging remit attracts multiple view points and opinions.
‘We do, however, recognise that Remembrance Sunday at IWM London, with the meaning it holds for different people, was not the moment to share this particular iteration of Breaking the Silence.
‘We apologise to anyone who attended who was offended or upset by the performance in any way.’
According to the pre-publicity, the performance was organised by workshop leaders MC Angel and Ahmad Dayes.
MC Angel (real name: Shauna O’Briain) is described on the Midi Music website as ‘a talented wordsmith, performing as a spoken word artist and hip-hop emcee as well as writing page poetry.’ Mr Dayes is described as an ‘engineer, producer, musician’ with over 20- years’ experience.
The incident comes after a small number of other reviews on the museum’s tripadvisor listing criticised their presentation recently.
One reviewer, leaving one star out of five, commented last month: ‘It’s gone slightly woke, trying to be all things to all people and failing. ‘
Another wrote earlier this month: ‘Please keep coming or it will be replaced cheerfully by some woke apology. It is only a matter of time before we are encouraged to be ashamed of our past.' 
MC Angel, Ahmad Dayes and the Midi Music Company have all been contacted for comment.",-2
66,"A new Met Police policy on handcuffing tells officers to ask themselves 44 questions before arresting a suspect and details the procedure in a child-style ABC guide.
The mammoth decision process is laid out in full in the new 25-page document published by Scotland Yard.
It puts into official policy nearly 50 questions officers should consider when they are using the police-issue restraints.
The questions include, 'What could go wrong (and what could go well)?', 'What is happening?', and, 'What do I not know?'.
Other advice to mull over also includes, 'Do I need to take action immediately?' and 'What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?' 
Most are from the College of Policing's National Decision Model but are now enshrined in the official equipment policy. 
It is not clear what the Met's previous policy on the police restraint tactic had been.
But the new rules have been drawn up after complaints from the black community they had been disproportionately targeted in stop and search. 
Also featured is an alphabet-themed guide to handcuffing that warns to, 'Always ask the suspect if the cuffs are too tight'.
It includes the advice to 'always double-lock the handcuffs'. 
The Met publicised the new policy this morning, which comes after a review by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist. 
Industry insiders and former police officers have slammed the alphabet-style guide, with former Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley warning it was indicative of the 'weakness of senior police leadership'.
He told GB News: 'Frankly, it's an example of the ineptitude, the pusillanimous, the weakness of decision-making that we now see with senior police leadership.
'Police officers, when they decide to use force or apply handcuffs, need to run through in their mind a lot of different things which comes down to: ""Is this the right thing to be doing, and can I defend my options?""
 'What we've now see happen is something that's going to affect three groups of people. 
'First, it is going to put off the cops using force or arresting people. There's nothing more difficult than trying to get some officers to deal with confrontation.
'It's very easy to back down. The hard thing is to motivate a police officer to be nosy. 
'The second thing is, the public are going to think: ""What on earth is going on here?""
'The third point really is that those who are ""baddies"", it's going to give them an opportunity for an outer.'  
Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said of the force's new policy: 'My number one priority remains tackling violent crime and keeping people safe from street crime – which is blighting the lives of too many young people.
'Alongside that, I have set out to increase the trust and confidence of communities in their police service.
'We know that not all communities have the same level of trust in us – I am determined to change that.
'The handcuffing review could not have taken place effectively without the input and contribution of many front line police officers and members of the public. I thank them all for their time, effort and valuable honesty.'

The policy follows a review commissioned by the Met Commissioner Cressida Dick in 2019 into the use of handcuffs before an arrest has taken place.
It came after complaints from black communities they were being disproportionately targeted.
The Met said the review would make sure the tactic, for which there is a sound legal basis in some circumstances, was justified and recorded on each occasion.
It fed in consultation responses from young black men aged between 16 to 25 years-old.
A Met spokeswoman said: 'The launch of the policy, which covers all aspects of the use of handcuffs, is the final recommendation from the 2020 review to be implemented.
'Officers are already receiving additional legal training, more public and personal safety training, with further emphasis on de-escalation; and more community input to understand the respective experiences of the public and police officers during encounters on the streets of London.' 
Last October a highly criticial review of the Met's use of stop and search powers has revealed officers stopped two black men after they were seen 'fist bumping,'.
The review by the Independent Office for Police Conduct revealed the officers thought the pair had just completed a drug deal, in one of a number of issues raised by the watchdog.
It found handcuffs were used in nearly all instances where other tactics could have de-escalated an encounter, while officers also failed to use bodycam video from the outset of their interaction with some members of the public.
The IOPC said their review 'mirrors concerns,' already raised by communities in the Capital.
Regional director Sal Naseem said: 'We saw a lack of understanding from officers about why their actions were perceived to be discriminatory.
'We recommended the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) takes steps to ensure that assumptions, stereotypes and bias (conscious or unconscious) are not informing or affecting their officers' decision-making on stop and search.'
The IOPC has now recommended 11 ways the Met Police can improve its use of stop and search powers.
The watchdog's recommendations include offering better education of powers to officers, improving monitoring from above, ensuring racial prejudice is removed and making sure the stop and search encounter is ended swiftly after suspicion is allayed.
There were 558,973 stop and searches carried out in the year to March , 2020, under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Pace) in England and Wales, according to Home Office figures.
Just 13 per cent (73,423) of that year's stop and searches led to an arrest - down from last year's 15 per cent.
The increase in stop and searches was larger for white people in 2021 (with an increase of 95,562 to 280,661) than for black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds people (who saw an increase of 55,215 searches to 185,401).
But BAME people were stopped at a rate of 4.1 times higher than those who were white, a similar rate to the previous year (4.3), the report added.
And the rate of black people who were stopped and search per 1,000 of the population was at its highest since 2014 at 54, compared with 35 in 2014.
This is the highest number of stops and searches since 2013/14 (872,518), but still below the peak in 2010/11 (1,179,746), the report said.
It is also an increase of 193,419 (53%) compared to the 2018/19, when 365,554 searches were recorded.
Mr Naseem added: 'The review highlights the need for the Met to reflect on the impact this kind of decision-making is having.
'There is also a need to better support officers on the front line to do their jobs effectively with the right training and supervision so they aren't subjected to further complaints and investigation. There is clearly much room for improvement.'",-2
67,"Migrants have been filmed cheering and clapping as they launched dinghies off the coast of France to cross the English Channel as French police officers stood by and filmed the scenes.
Video footage taken on Tuesday - the same day that a staggering 1,000 migrants made it to the UK - showed groups of migrants, including young children, clapping in celebration as they managed to restart their boat's engine on a Calais beach.
In the clip, taken by local jogger Franck Viandier, dozens of migrants crowded around the small boat and helped to push it into the water while children clapped and cheered with excitement as they prepared to cross the Channel.
Other footage obtained by ITV News showed dozens of migrants wearing life jackets carrying a small dinghy down to the sea while French Gendarmerie officers stood by on the shore and watched.
Some officers appeared to be holding up their phones and filming the scenes, while others stood by and did not intervene as the migrants prepared to launch a boat, heading for the UK. 
On Tuesday, MailOnline journalists witnessed two 50ft long boats, setting off from the beaches near Wimereux, around 20 mile south of Calais. No police were on the beach at the time - but turned up some 24 hours later.  
Today, the RNLI rescued 23 migrants before around 50 more arrived in Kent. More people are expected to make the dangerous 21-mile trip across the Dover Strait throughout the day as weather is said to be good in the Channel.
A lifeboat was scrambled this morning to rescue people from a boat in the Channel, with one migrant airlifted to hospital after suffering a suspected medical episode while attempting the crossing. The man, who was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, is believed to be okay. 
Mr Viandier, who jogs along a Calais beach every morning, said he believes the Gendarmerie officers are doing their best amid the migrant crisis, saying that it is not 'their job' to fight migrants if they want to cross to England.
He told ITV News: 'Sometimes there is a lot of police, I can see the fight sometimes. But they say to me 'it is not our job to fight with these people, the people want to go to England, we are French police'.'
France claims that it deploys 950 officers in the Calais region each day in a bid to prevent illegal Channel crossings. 
Migrants launch their boats from France along a 100mile stretch of beach, making it harder for authorities to stop them from crossing the Channel. Out of 40,000 crossings this year, only around half were stopped, according to official figures.
Meanwhile, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said the UK's offer to set up joint patrols with the French was rebuffed.
He added: 'We constantly discuss operational options with the French, we have offered to conduct joint patrols. It's not an offer that the French have currently taken us up on, but it continues to be on the table.' 
Official figures are yet to be released but it is feared that Tuesday's total could rival the 1,185 record reached last Thursday as the migrant crisis reaches breaking point. The figures have taken some two days to calculate due to the sheer number of arrivals.
The previous daily high was 853. At least 3,941 migrants have arrived this month in 121 boats, taking the total for the year so far to 23,683.
This morning, an RNLI Dover lifeboat was launched just after 5.30am at the request of the UK Coastguard following reports of a grey dinghy in distress. 
A number of 999 calls were made to the rescue centre requesting assistance with reports that a man onboard required medical attention. 
Lifeboat crew reported there were 23 other people on the 6-foot grey rib that was caught out in rough seas. A rescue and recovery operation was launched with a helicopter seen airlifting a person to hospital.  
A spokesman for the Coastgaurd confirmed: 'HM Coastguard has been coordinating a search and rescue response to an incident off Kent, working with Border Force and other partners. We sent the coastguard helicopter from Lydd and Dover RNLI lifeboat.' 
Meanwhile, the Home Office also confirmed that 66 migrants made the perilous Channel crossing in three boats on Wednesday. French authorities stopped a further 43 in three small boats.
It comes after it was reported that Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
However, No 10 said it would not comment on conversations with specific countries over the processing of migrants who arrive in the UK. 
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'I've always been clear that we want to keep all options on the table.
'As illegal migration is an international issue, you'd expect us to have discussions with both France and other international partners to help reduce illegal migration.'
He added the UK had been in talks with a 'number of countries' but added: 'I'm simply saying I'm not going to get into speculation about ongoing discussions with individually named countries.
'As you'd expect given the international elements of this, it is right the Government speaks to a number of countries about these global challenges.'
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project could cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
Ten migrants have been found dead in an overcrowded wooden boat trying to cross the Mediterranean.
The ramshackle boat, which was packed with around 100 refugees, was found by the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) team, drifting 30 nautical miles away from the coast of Libya, where it departed. 
Dozens of survivors were rescued by the MSF team, and are now on the Geo Barents rescue vessel.
Those on board revealed there was a powerful smell of fuel in the boat and victims had spent more than 13 hours crammed in the lower deck. 
So far this year, around 1,225 migrants have died or gone missing while trying to make the perilous crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean. 
Caroline Willemen, project coordinator on the Geo Barents, described the Mediterranean as the 'deadliest migration route'.
'We are once more witnessing Europe's unwillingness to provide the much needed dedicated and proactive search and rescue capacity in the Central Mediterranean' she added.
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday.  
Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said: 'We are facing a global migration crisis and the number of people arriving on UK shores is unacceptable.
'We must work closely with our European and international partners to target the ruthless organised criminal gangs behind these deadly crossing and welcome the French Government's commitment to step up action to prevent crossings, including increased surveillance, greater intelligence sharing and deployment of frontline operations
'The New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken system, break the deadly business model of the people smugglers and prevent further loss of life.' 
Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has confirmed that the Government is looking at processing migrants who cross the Channel in small boats overseas.
He told LBC Radio: 'First of all, you're always better off dealing with the flow of migrants from a crisis or a conflict in the region itself, our overwhelming focus is on that. It's better for migrants, it's better to be resettled and relocated nearer to your home.
'But to the extent that we get this flow over to the UK, it's important to reduce the pull factor, we will work with all our partners - and it's not just one country, we've looked at the Australian experience, we've been talking with the Danes about this and we want to make sure the processing, if it's possible - and that will depend on the good will and co-operation of partners - can be done elsewhere.'
Asked if this will include Albania and Rwanda, he said: 'Let me avoid talking about individual countries but just say with international partners this is something we're probing because we want to test the idea because we will do everything we can to resolve this problem.'
Pressed if the plan will cost £100,000 per migrant, he said: 'I don't recognise that number. Until you've got a detailed agreement with a particular country, I don't think we'll be in a position to cost it.'
Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal that migrants evicted from their squalid Dunkirk camp by French police have set up a new encampment in a field next door.
Others have erected their tents in woods less than half a mile away from their demolished camp to keep alive their dream of finding a place on a boat to the UK.
The crowded camp on an area of abandoned industrial land and was home to 1,500 migrants until it was closed down by police at Grand-Synthe near Dunkirk.
Residents of the camp were given the option of being taken by coach to shelters across France in return for going through the French process for asylum seekers.
But most of them chose to continue living rough and refused to accept the offer out of fears that it would hinder their long term aim to reach the UK. 
Small groups of migrants today returned to their old camp and broke through the fences erected by police in a half-hearted bid to seal off the entrance.
MailOnline today witnessed pitiful scenes as former camp residents rummaged through stinking piles or rubbish left behind after the mass eviction. 
Migrants piled up old clothing, bedding, tents and pots and pans into supermarket trolleys which they wheeled away to their new camps.
Others chopped up pallets and other construction material from flattened makeshift shelters to get fuel for their camp fires.
Many of the migrants including families with children had only a short distance to travel to their new home in the field next door to their old camp.
They included Iraqi Kurdish mother Kazhal Rzgar, 46, and her two daughters Hadya, 22, and Hasta, seven, and her and her two sons who put up their old tent in a corner of the field.
The family have been surviving largely on food hand outs from charities since they arrived 16 days ago at the Grand-Synthe camp after landing in Italy on a migrant boat.
Channel migrants are set to be flown to ALBANIA to a new asylum centre at cost of £100,000-a-head a year as French deny agreeing to stop all crossings 
Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania, it was reported last night.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project would cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday. 
On Tuesday, around 80 migrants were pictured climbing into inflatable dinghies in northern France before they were pushed into the sea and began their journey to Britain. 
A total of 1,185 people crossed the channel last Thursday, eclipsing the previous daily high of 853. Overall this year, there have been more than 20,000 crossings.
In response to news about the plan to open an asylum centre in Albania, a Home Office spokesman said: 'Migrants making these dangerous crossings are putting their lives at risk and it is vital we do everything we can to prevent them and break the business model of the criminal gangs exploiting people.
Migrants who have been picked up after landing or intercepted at sea are taken to a Border Force processing centre, such as Tug Haven near Dover. 
Here arrivals are triaged to identify any medical needs or vulnerabilities, fed and checked to see if they have a criminal record. Adults have an initial interview before being sent to accommodation centres across Britain, paid for by UK taxpayers and provided by private contractors. 
The migrants are given £37.75 per week for essentials like food, clothes and toiletries while they wait for a decision on their asylum application. If the claim is rejected they face deportation back to their home country. 
Kent County Council normally takes unaccompanied children into its care, although other local authorities are also involved in this programme. 
'People should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and as part of our response it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the channel and work with international partners to put an end to these dangerous journeys.'
When the plans were first reported by The Sun last month, the Albanian prime minister's official spokesman branded the reports as 'absolutely untrue'.   
The news comes after it was suggested in March that asylum seekers who cross the Channel illegally to reach Britain could be sent to a third country such as Turkey. 
Other options on the table were islands off the coast of Scotland, the Isle of Man, or Gibraltar. 
At the time, charities branded the proposals 'inhumane', while an immigration expert said that whilst there was no law prohibiting such a move, there was 'bound to be a court case about it'. 
On Wednesday, new research from the British Refugee Council revealed that nearly two thirds of migrants who cross the Channel to reach the UK are originally from the Middle East.    
More than 61 per cent of those who make the dangerous journey across the 21 mile straight Calais to Dover are nationals from countries such as Iran and Iraq.
The highest number of migrants arriving in small boats are from Iran, with 3,187 Iranian nationals reaching UK shores from January last year to May this year. 
This accounts for 26 per cent of all arrivals in small boats over this period.
Figures also show 2,185 people from Iraq crossed the Channel over the same period. 
The figure makes up around 17 per cent of the 12,195 migrants who arrived in the UK in small boats in 2020 and at the start of this year.
Other Middle Eastern nationalities in the top 10 countries of people who arrived in small boats include war-torn nations such as Syria and Yemen, along with oil rich Kuwait.  
From non-Middle Eastern countries, the largest number of arrivals came from Sudan, in north-east Africa. Around eight per cent of small boat arrivals were from Vietnam, while around six per cent of people arrived from Eritrea and one per cent from Ethiopia.
All of the nations in the top 10, which make up 91 per cent of arrivals on UK shores, are countries were human rights abuses and persecution are common, according to the British Refugee Council. 
According to figures obtained by the British Refugee council, migrants arriving in the UK in small boats between January 2020 and May 2021 were from: 
Iran: 26 per cent
Iraq 17 per cent
Sudan 11 per cent
Syria: 10 per cent
Vietnam 8 per cent
Eritrea: 6 per cent
Afghanistan 5 per cent
Kuwait 5 per cent
Yemen 2 per cent
Ethiopia 1 per cent
Other: 9 per cent  

The research came after MailOnline journalists witnessed the moment that two 50ft long inflatable dinghies loaded with up to 40 migrants each leave northern France on Tuesday morning. 
At dawn. dog walkers and a jogger watched in amazement as the two separate groups, who had been hiding overnight in the sand dunes, ran to the water's edge with their giant boats.
Smuggler minders waded in to the sea as the migrants climbed aboard for the dangerous trip to Britain but they did not make the journey with them.  
Despite the ongoing crossings and the lack of progress in stopping them, Ms Patel had claimed she had agreed with French interior minister Gerald Darmanin agreed to work to prevent '100 per cent of crossings' of the Channel.   
The Home Office issued a joint statement from the pair which said they had agreed measures to 'stop the dangerous crossings' of the 'deadly route'.
But the French embassy in London said the 100% figure 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin held talks on Monday night with the UK and France involved in a long-running row over how to address the problem of migrants seeking to cross the Channel.
The 'joint statement' issued afterwards said: 'Both the Home Secretary and interior minister agreed to strengthen operational cooperation further.
'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings.
'They agreed to accelerate the delivery of the commitments made in the joint agreement of July 2021 to deliver on their joint determination to prevent 100% of crossings and make this deadly route unviable.'
But the French embassy said on Twitter: 'For the record, the 100% figure was not agreed between the Home Secretary and French interior minister @GDarmanin and should not be presented as an agreed commitment: it is not.
'And it is not part of the joint statement.'
However, in a press conference on October 9, Mr Darmanin said that with the correct resources and the support of the British authorities, 100 per cent should be able to be reached.",-2
68,"Prince Charles’s charity was plunged into fresh crisis yesterday by a watchdog investigation.
Charity Commission chiefs are launching a statutory inquiry – their most serious level of probe – into its dealings with the Mahfouz Foundation. 
They want to know whether the foundation received donations meant for the prince’s charity, with some cash then moved elsewhere.
The foundation is run by Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, a Saudi billionaire granted an honorary CBE by the prince in 2016. 
Charles’s charity is already being probed by Scottish regulators over claims it accepted a £500,000 gift from a Russian donor that was later rejected by an ethics committee.
The latest development comes after the prince’s right-hand man quit over ‘cash for honours’ allegations. Michael Fawcett resigned  as chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation following reports that he promised to secure a knighthood and British citizenship for Mr Mahfouz in exchange for major donations.
In 2017, Mr Fawcett wrote to an aide of Mr Mahfouz, who had donated £1.5million to help renovate two of the prince’s Scottish properties, saying that ‘in light of his ongoing and most recent generosity... we are willing and happy to support and contribute to the application for citizenship’.
On headed notepaper in his then-role as chief executive of the Dumfries House Trust, he added that the charity would also apply to raise his honorary CBE to a knighthood. 
The letter may form a part of ‘initial’ police inquiries, it has emerged.
Sources said Charles was not aware of any link between donations to the foundation and honours.
Announcing its inquiry yesterday, the Charity Commission said of the Mahfouz Foundation: ‘The commission has been engaging with its trustees since September after media reports alleged that donations, intended for the Prince’s Foundation, went instead to the Mahfouz Foundation.
‘The regulator has also identified concerns around the trustees’ governance and financial control of the charity.’
The inquiry will examine whether ‘donations received by the Mahfouz Foundation were intended for the charity’, whether they were used ‘in accordance with donors’ intentions’ and whether they should be returned to donors.
It will also look at whether trustees have carried out legal duties.
The commission added that the scope of the inquiry could be extended ‘if additional issues emerge’. 
It is believed the investigation will examine the whereabouts of £500,000 donated to the Prince’s Foundation by Dmitry Leus, a former Russian banker.
1981: As a teenager, Michael Fawcett lands a job as junior footman to the Queen at Buckingham Palace. He later moves to Kensington Palace as assistant valet to Prince Charles, who is setting up home with Diana.
1990: He is reportedly trusted to squeeze toothpaste on to Charles's brush when the prince broke an arm playing polo.
1992: When the royal couple separate, Diana has the locks of the marital apartment changed to keep out Fawcett, who pinned his loyalties to Charles.
1998: Three members of palace staff go to the prince to complain about Fawcett's allegedly overbearing and bullying manner, and he quits. But his resignation leaves Charles in tears and he is reinstated and promoted within a week.
2000: Fawcett is appointed a Member of the Victorian Order by the Prince in the New Year's Honours – an honour normally reserved for Royal Household members.
2003: He is again forced out for supposedly selling on behalf of Charles gifts the prince did not want. An internal inquiry clears him of any financial misconduct. He resigns but the prince rewards him with a £500,000 severance packet. Fawcett sets up a private events company, Premier Mode.
2005: Premier Mode organises Charles and Camilla's wedding party.
2017: Fawcett joins the board of A G Carrick, a company Charles set up to sell mementoes at his Highgrove shop. Fawcett also runs the trust set up to run Prince Charles's pet project, Dumfries House.
2018: Fawcett is appointed to a £95,000-a-year role as chief executive of Charles's charity, The Prince's Foundation.
2021: It is alleged that Fawcett fixed a CBE for a Saudi billionaire who had donated more than £1.5 million to royal charities. Fawcett resigns for the third time. 
Following the donation, Prince Charles told Mr Leus he was ‘incredibly grateful’ and proposed the pair meet after the coronavirus pandemic.
But the foundation’s ethics committee rejected the money over concerns about a previous money-laundering conviction, which was later overturned.
Mr Leus insisted the money was not returned to him. In September, the Mail on Sunday reported that the Mahfouz Foundation had admitted holding £300,000 of the cash, with Michael Wynne-Parker, a society fixer, allegedly holding the remaining £200,000.
In a statement to the newspaper, Mr Leus said he had never heard of the Mahfouz Foundation and was ‘deeply shocked at what appears to have happened to a charitable donation given in good faith’.
The Mahfouz Foundation appears to have been set up in 2012 to promote the history and culture of the Middle East to the UK.
However there is little information on its website other than a black-and-white photograph of Mr Mahfouz alongside his title, including his honorary CBE.
Mr Mahfouz has been accused of paying fixers with links to the prince tens of thousands of pounds in the hope of securing an honour. 
He allegedly believed a title would help him secure British citizenship. He denies any wrongdoing.
For the financial year to the end of April, the Mahfouz Foundation had a total income of just £10,000, records show.
It has two trustees, although Mr Mahfouz is not among them. Over the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that Mr Fawcett had agreed to help Mr Mahfouz secure a knighthood if he could back ‘three possibilities’ for donations to Dumfries House, Charles’s 18th century mansion.
One option was £10million to design and build houses in the area. The Prince’s Foundation was unable to comment because of the ongoing investigation but sources said it would be happy to offer its cooperation on the matter. 
A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment.
n The High Court’s decision to ban media organisations from a secret hearing about Prince Philip’s will has prompted legal action.
Lawyers are seeking permission to argue that a judge did not properly consider the need for open justice. The Duke of Edinburgh’s will is to be kept from public view for 90 years after a September ruling by Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the family division of the High Court.
The legal challenge, brought by The Guardian, will draw attention to a century-long tradition that sees senior judges lock away wills belonging to royals.
British laws hold that all wills should be open to the public to ensure the wishes of the deceased are carried out and to alert creditors. Since the early 19th century the monarch has been exempt.",-2
69,"Another 23 road-blocking Insulate Britain activists could be locked up within weeks, it emerged today, as the eco mob announced another 'nonviolent civil resistance' demonstration.
The group said they would protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice tomorrow in 'solidarity' with protesters being jailed, despite the court complex being closed at weekends  
Nine offenders were jailed for up to six months yesterday. Insulate Britain says 23 more people are also being summoned to court for contempt of court in the coming weeks, where they are all likely to receive similar sentences to those handed down to others.  
Today the husband of one eco-zealot who is now going on hunger strike in prison said he was 'terrified' for her as they come to terms with spending Christmas apart.
Emma Smart, 44 - who will be housed in Europe's largest women's prison which is home to murderers and child rapists - was handed a four-month sentence alongside Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Tim Speers, 36, and James Thomas, 47, for taking part in a protest on the M25 on October 8.
Ana Heyatawin, 58, and Louis McKechnie, 20, were sent to prison for three months, while Ben Taylor, 27, was jailed for six months after boasting he would immediately block the roads again if not imprisoned. 
Smart was sent to HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, which was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in 2004. Up to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 people in each one. 
Each wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take it back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months. 
When a woman arrives at the prison they are searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day. Notable former inmates include murderer Rose West, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya. 
A study in July 2016 by HM Inspectorate of Prisons found prisoners were normally offered about five options for lunch and the same for dinner. A typical prison lunch consisted of a sandwich, wrap or portion of pasta, served with a piece of fruit or crisps and biscuits. Typical dinners included a choice of curry, pie, baked fish or casserole, accompanied by rice, vegetables, potatoes, and a choice of dessert or fruit such as apples and oranges.
The most recent report of Bronzefield by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons in 2018 said many inmates were facing 'significant mental health problems', 'self-harm among prisoners remained high' and 'violent incidents had increased significantly over the previous four years' - but concluded that it was an 'overwhelmingly safe prison'.
But another report released two months ago found an 18-year-old inmate who lost her baby at the jail in 2019 should never have given birth alone in her cell. The probe found the mother, known as Ms A, pressed her cell bell twice and asked for a nurse but nobody came. One hour later a prison officer shone a torch into her cell but said there was nothing out of the ordinary. But the inmate said she was on all fours at the time and described being in constant pain, before passing out then awaking to find her daughter had been born but was not breathing.
The male Insulate Britain protesters have gone to Category B HMP Pentonville - known as 'The Ville' - in Islington, North London, which houses about 1,300 men who live in a mixture of single and shared rooms over seven wings. 
Smart, a biologist, told the High Court in London this week that the court proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways. However, she has faced allegations of hypocrisy after undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her husband Andy Smith in 2012. 
Mr Smith, 45, who volunteers as a climate activist full time but has not taken part in any demonstrations with Extinction Rebellion offshoot Insulate Britain, said he is 'terrified' for her. Mr Smith said he was aware that Smart would be going on a hunger strike if she was put behind bars, adding: 'It's something we discuss quite frequently'. 
He added: 'She is incredibly resolute in her actions. I stand by her in all the decisions she makes. Morally they are in the right in this instance and she really stands by her convictions. She's an incredibly passionate person who has spent her whole entire adult life trying to save wildlife and protect the environment. 
'That's deeply ingrained in who she is. That freedom to go out on to the street and protest has been taken away from her, so her going on a hunger strike in prison is another way to continue that process.
'All nine of them in court today were pretty resolute that you can sentence them, but this isn't going to resolve the problem and people will still continue to protest. Obviously I'm terrified. It's a horrible thing for her to go through but I stand by her decision to do that. It's (going on hunger strike) something we discuss quite frequently, the different ways we can make sacrifices to highlight injustices. I'm aware that she had previously talked to other people who've already done hunger strikes and been on hunger strikes. She's a scientist, she's done her research.'
He added that the sentences were less than the supporters of the group were expecting so they were 'relieved', but still felt it was a 'complete injustice'. He said: 'I completely stand with them on what they've done and how they've acted. I would obviously rather the judge side with them but they did break the law and then they were willing to face the consequences of breaking the law.'
Announcing her intention to go on hunger strike after being jailed, Smart said: 'Our Government is betraying us, betraying our vulnerable people and betraying our children's future. I believe that my intentions are morally right, even if my actions are deemed legally wrong.  This court may see me as being on the wrong side of the law, but in my heart I know I am on the right side of history. I will not be a bystander.' 
Following two months of motorway chaos caused by Insulate Britain, Smart told the court that she was there to 'ensure future survival' and compared watching the climate crisis to watching a child trapped in a burning house. 
'She said: 'I'm asking when you consider my sentence that my actions are proportionate to the crisis we are facing, where 8,500 people die a year from cold and hunger in their own homes. I cannot stand by and watch. 
'I would run to them. Our Government is betraying us, our vulnerable people and our children's future. I will not be a bystander while our Government fails and betrays its people, I will continue to do what is necessary.'  
Eco protester Smart and her husband drove 80,975 miles in 858 days in an 18-year-old Toyota during the world tour from 2012 to 2016.  
Ahead of her trip in 2012, Smart told BBC: 'It's a massive scale it's taken 18 months of planning and saving and we are working extremely hard but here we are now about to set off and it's all very real.'

HMP BRONZEFIELD
Ana Heyatawin, 58, and Emma Smart, 44, have both been sent to HMP Bronzefield after being jailed.
The jail in Ashford, Surrey, was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in June 2004, as well as being the 10th privately-run prison in England.
Up to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 women in each one. Each wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months.
When a woman arrives at the prison they will be searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They will also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day. 
Notable former inmates at Bronzefield include murderers Rose West and Joanna Dennehy, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya. 
HMP PENTONVILLE
Louis McKechnie, 20, Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Tim Speers, 36, James Thomas, 47, and Ben Taylor, 37, have all be taken to HMP Pentonville after being jailed at the High Court.
The Category B jail - known as 'The Ville' - in Islington, North London, houses about 1,300 men who live in a mixture of single and shared rooms across seven wings.
When a prisoner first arrives they are allowed to contact one relative by phone and see a medical professional about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.
They then have a four-day induction period to explain the prison rules, and education opportunities. A service provided by Novus lets them study for qualifications in subjects such as carpentry, food safety and painting.
The jail also has four gym areas and a multi-faith chaplaincy service and works with the Catch 22 organisation which helps prisoners involved in gangs.
Notable former inmates over the last 40 years include footballers George Best and Nile Ranger; singers George Michael and Pete Doherty; and actor Keith Allen. 
The couple broke their global trip into four phases and regularly blogged about their travelS inside their 4x4.
The first leg of their trip saw them travel to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Mongolia, Russia, Ukraine and Poland.
This was followed by visits to Portugal, Morocco, Western Sahara, Spain and Andorra. 
The couple also travelled to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosova along their world expedition.
When news of the trip emerged in October, critics branded it a sign of 'hypocrisy at its very finest'.   
Insulate Britain began a wave of protests on September 13, demanding that the Government makes plans to insulate the UK's homes. 
They blocked roads around London as well as in Birmingham, Manchester and Dover - causing miles of tailbacks in rush hour. 
The nine eco-zealots were jailed over a protest on October 8 at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire which saw a total of 16 people arrested - but dozens more activists are set to be issued with committal proceedings in the next few days.
The group and its supporters chanted 'We are unstoppable, another world is possible' as they were led to the cells through the dock by security officers at the court in London. 
Heyatawin and McKechnie were both jailed for three months while Buse, Paluch-Machnik, Rock, Smart, Speers and Thomas all received four-month sentences. 
The shorter jail term for Heyatawin was because of her medical issues, while McKechnie's was due to his younger age. The men will be at Category B Pentonville jail in Islington and the women at Category A Bronzefield in Surrey. 
Insulate Britain said the protesters were expected to serve at least half of their sentence. They had been facing a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine for contempt of court. 
The demonstrations have seen the campaigners glue themselves to the road before being removed by police. At least 174 activists have been involved on 19 days of protests so far and there have been 860 arrests. 
Group spokesman Tracey Mallaghan said after the case: 'The right thing to do is highlight injustice, breaking the law if needed. This is what the Suffragettes did and Martin Luther King did, and it is what Insulate Britain has done.'
It comes after Taylor told the court on Tuesday that if he was not in jail he would 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'.
Taylor's submissions were described yesterday by Dame Victoria Sharp as 'inflammatory' and a 'call to arms', and he was therefore given a longer sentence of six months 'to deter (him) from committing further breaches'. 
The judge, sitting with Mr Justice Chamberlain, said there was no alternative to jail sentences given the group's actions were so serious and they had made it clear they intended to further flout court orders. 
She said: 'The defendants, or some of them, seem to want to be martyrs for their cause and the media campaign surrounding this hearing appears designed to suggest this. We, however, have to act dispassionately and proportionately.'
FOUL-MOUTHED RANTER - Ben Taylor: 6 months
Defiant Taylor, 27, was handed the longest sentence for what judges called an 'inflammatory' call to arms, in which he told the court that the government must 'f****ing act' on the group's demands. He also boasted that he would immediately go out and block another road if he was not jailed.. The court therefore extended his detention 'to deter Mr Taylor from committing further breaches'.
DEVOUT CHRISTIAN - Dr Benjamin Buse: 4 months
The meek University of Bristol researcher, 36, was the only defendant to have a barrister representing his interests. The court was told that Dr Buse, who has published on topics like 'microanalysis of Uranium', was a devout Christian and popular member of his local church in Cheddar. Barrister Owen Greenhall said he volunteered for charity and donated hundreds of pounds to good causes every month.
THE REBEL SCARED OF JAIL - Oliver Rock: 4 months
The 41-year-old carpenter from south London, admitted he was 'c**pping himself' about going to jail and enjoyed drawn-out cinches with his partner before the final hearing began. He said that after feeling 'depressed' that the 2003 Iraq War march had failed, he was inspired to take up more extreme tactics, in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion, which he joined in 2019. He told the court he only earned about £10,000 a year, often making 'small stage sets'.
HUNGER STRIKER - Emma Smart: 4 months
The 44-year-old, from Weymouth, announced via an Insulate Britain spokesman that she would be going on hunger strike. She told the court that the proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways. But Smart, a biologist, has previously been criticised for undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her partner, Andy.
STUDENT AGED ONLY 21 - Louis McKechnie: 3 months
The student from Weymouth, who turned 21 yesterday, was given a month off his sentence in recognition of his youth. He said his only income was his student loan, which all went on living expenses, so he would struggle to pay his share of the bill in paying the government's legal costs.
THE OLDEST DEFENDANT - Ana Heyatawin: 3 months
The oldest of the defendants, the blue-haired 58-year-old from Wells, had her sentence reduced to three months, after she told the court about her litany of health issues, including a personality disorder, depression, sciatica and bad eyesight.
'ENLIGHTENED CAPITALIST' - James Thomas: 4 months
The 47-year-old architect said he had previously regarded himself as an 'enlightened capitalist sort of guy', but was inspired to abandon his career and join protest movements after seeing a film about the successes won by the Suffragettes and their campaign of direct action. He said that the 'scariest part' of his time inside would be the impact on his relationship.
INSPIRED BY GRANDPARENTS - Roman Paluch-Machnik: 4 months
The 28-year-old from Ealing said that learning about the experiences of his grandparents, all four of whom escaped Poland during the war, had helped inspire his activism. An active member of Extinction Rebellion since 2018, he has travelled the country giving talks on climate change and training others how to participate in 'Non-Violent Direct Action'.
'SANE IN AN INSANE WORLD' - Tim Speers: 4 months
The 36-year-old, from east London, pontificated in court, 'in an insane world, the sane will be seen as insane'. He believes that Insulate Britain has led 'one of the most successful campaigns in history'. He was first arrested on Waterloo Bridge in 2019 at an Extinction Rebellion protest, commenting: 'I refuse sit back while greed and ignorance takes life to extinction.'
Before the group were sentenced, the National Highways barrister said the legal costs of bringing proceedings against the nine activists had reached £91,000. She argued the judges should make an order for the costs against the defendants and that, even if they are unable to pay them, such an order would be an 'important symbol'.
She also said the agency had a duty to attempt to recover the costs, as they are from public funds. But Dame Victoria Sharp said she and Mr Justice Chamberlain will give their decision on costs in writing at a later date. 
The nine activists said they did not have the funds to pay their share of the legal costs. Taylor said he has been volunteering for a couple of years and is currently claiming Universal Credit, which has recently been cut. He added: '£10,000 is a lot of money so unless there is a deadline, it will take a long time to pay off.'
Smart told the court she has been working as a volunteer in wildlife conservation and climate activism, and does not have any money. Addressing National Highways' legal team, she said: 'You are claiming more for postage than I have earned in the last three years. The fact you are profiting from our stand and trying to save the lives of ... people is obscene. Take what I have, come to my house and sell my clothes because that's all I have.'
Rock said he is a carpenter and was badly affected by the pandemic as he built theatre sets, while Speers said he was a full-time volunteer and claims Universal Credit. Speers added: 'I might be dead before I can pay these costs.'
A further 23 protesters have also defied one or more of several injunctions granted to Transport for London and National Highways over the past two months. And Insulate Britain said it expects these 23 people to be summoned in the coming days, which would bring the total to at least 32 people who are due to face contempt of court. 
Lawyers representing the Government said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters and were expected to be brought by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27. Evidence is also being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2.
Raj Chada, solicitor at Hodge Jones and Allen law firm which supported the protesters, said: 'With these prison terms, the long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience is under attack again. 
'Rather than leaving courts to imprison those that raise the alarm, it should be the Government that acts to protect us against the climate crisis.' 
The group has insisted it intends to continue with the protests until the Government agrees to insulate homes.
Dame Victoria told the court that police bodycam footage of the protest showed officers struggling to remove the demonstrators from the road.
The court heard the activists moved towards oncoming traffic before some successfully glued themselves on the road after being told to clear.
The judge said: 'The footage shows a somewhat chaotic scene with the defendants very close to traffic, and in some instances moving traffic, and the police attempting to restrain them from continuing with their protest and re-entering the road.'
Dame Victoria Sharp told the activists that it is 'integral' that orders made by the court 'must be obeyed'. She said: 'In our democratic society, all citizens are equal under the law and all are subject to the law.
'It is integral to the rule of law, and to the fair and peaceful resolution of disputes, first, that orders made by the court must be obeyed, unless and until they are set aside or subject to successful challenge on appeal, and secondly that a mechanism exists to enforce orders made by court against those who breach them.
'In this jurisdiction, that mechanism is provided by the law of contempt.' 
Insulate Britain activists were also told by the judge that ordinary members of the public 'have rights too'.
Dame Victoria Sharp told them: 'In a democratic society which recognises the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, protests causing some degree of inconvenience are to be expected and, up to a point, tolerated.
'But the words 'up to a point' are important. Ordinary members of the public have rights too, including the right to use the highways.
'The public's toleration of peaceful protest depends on an understanding that, in a society subject to the rule of law, the balance between the protesters' right to protest and the right of members of the public to use the highways is to be determined not by the say-so of the protesters, but according to the law.'
The judge also said the public has an 'interest in deterring disobedience to its orders and in upholding the rule of law'.
And Buse said in a statement: 'Care for the earth and all life requires me to act. My faith requires me to act, believing in the sacredness of creation and the demand for justice, justice for the trampled and exploited.
'Whilst acknowledging the importance of the courts, I have continued to break the injunction multiple times for we have a duty to the earth, to life, to future generations, to care and protect, this is the most important function of government, society and law.
'As we enter into the difficult years shifting to low carbon, and feeling the effects of climate change, we all need to be engaged in peaceful transformation; attempts to punish and crack down on peaceful protest opens the door to violent protest, which I deeply wish to avoid.'
Speers added: 'Never before has a civilisation had the burden and the privilege to see its own collapse coming.
'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified and criminalised, and those profiting from death are protected and rewarded. We asked for a chance to live. That's all.
'We did so in the tradition of non-violent protest upon which this country was built. In response, the Government declared it would do 'everything we can to stop them'.'
'In an insane world, the sane will be seen as insane. And in a democracy steeped in lies and corruption, good people have a duty to disobey bad laws. 
 
'We did our duty and I await the day when a judge in a court of law is brave enough to do theirs.'
An Insulate Britain spokesman said yesterday: 'This morning our Insulate Britain supporters have been sentenced. We are being failed and betrayed by our government. Our nine chose not to standby and be complicit in genocide.' 
After today's sentencing an Insulate Britain supporter read out the following letter in court, which said: 
'Over the last nine weeks, 174 ordinary people have held the government to account, asking that they deliver on their most basic of duties, to protect the British people, the economy and all we hold dear in our society. Your government has now chosen to act. It has chosen to imprison us for this demand.
'By imprisoning us, the government shows its cowardice. They would rather lock up pensioners than insulate their homes. They would rather lock up teachers than create thousands of proper jobs. 
'They would rather lock up young people than take practical steps to reduce emissions. They will lock us up and leave thousands to die of cold this winter. We knew we would face prison when we took this action, but we could not stand by while the government betrays the general public.
'Following the widely recognised failure of our government at COP26, we are continuing to ask them to get on with the job: of cutting carbon emissions; of insulating cold and leaky houses; of protecting the people of this country from climate collapse, because the lives of our children and those of all future generations hang in the balance.
'To the government we say, you can't imprison a flood, there are no unlimited fines against a famine, you can't bankrupt a fire.
'To the public we say, no one is coming to save you. In the past, when governments have failed to protect their people the right thing to do is to highlight this injustice, breaking the law if needed, this is what the suffragettes and Martin Luther King did and it is what Insulate Britain has done.
'We call on you to recognise that you also have a duty to act, as our government is betraying us. They can't even act to insulate Britain. What hope do we have of them protecting our children, our economy or our country?
'We say to those who look on in fear and denial: this will impact you and all that you love and look at what we did. A few hundred people captured the country's attention for months. Think what 1000 people can achieve? You have a choice. To act, to come and join us help change the tide of history, or to be a bystander and be complicit in enabling genocide. This tide will not come again, will you join us?'
During Tuesday's hearing, Taylor said if he was 'not put in prison' for breaching an injunction banning disruptive protests on the nation's roads, he will 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'. 
He added that 'whatever sentence or sanction' he was given 'will be counter-productive and will only serve to fuel the campaign of Insulate Britain'.
Taylor said: 'If you send me away to prison, ten people will step forward in my place. If you send each of us away, 100 people will step forward and take our places. If you send 100 of us away, 1,000 people will step forward to take our place.
'If you somehow manage to stop all non-violent protests, then things will only turn violent.' 
Speers described the country's democracy as 'steeped in lies' and said 'good people have a duty to breach bad laws'.
He said: 'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified. On a tradition of non-violent protest, in response, the Government said they will 'do everything to we can to stop them.' 
'That was from Grant Shapps, who had a second job under another name.'
Paluch-Machnik told the court the injunction 'is not just in context with the crisis we're in'.
He said: 'The Government would rather imprison pensioners than insulate their homes.'
Mr Paluch said retrofitting homes is the cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis and added: 'We are asking for a fully funded state-operated retrofitted service, like the NHS.
'Some of those who have spoken have said they're not afraid. I'm afraid you will take away my home and me away from my friends, family and partner. 
'But I'm more afraid of inaction and the climate catastrophe that has already began to crash on some of us. I stand by the action that brought me before this court, and if that sends me to prison, then so be it.'
He urged the court to look at 'more than the letter of the law' and 'make the commitment to insulate Britain'.
Heyatawin told the High Court she is 'traumatised' by the Government's attitude to climate change.
She said she 'does not accept the morality of the injunction' and said 'it is meaningless in the context of climate collapse'.
Ms Heyatawin added: 'I know how to behave. I think I'm a good person. I felt compelled to stop the world and get off. We are hurtling towards ecocide, genocide and our own suicide.'
Rock invited the court to observe a minute's silence 'to imagine what the climate crisis means for the future'.  He said: 'I'm proud of our actions and I stand by what we have done, we have not done this for personal gain. 
'I take responsibility for my actions and I did that in an attempt to mitigate the suffering of people in this country who cannot afford to adequately heat their homes.'
The only defendant to have a lawyer was Dr Ben Buse, a Bristol University researcher. Owen Greenhall told the court Dr Buse was active in his local church and a highly regarded member of the community.
Myriam Stacey QC, representing National Highways, told the court the message that the defendants are 'proud of their conduct' and 'will continue to defy the injunction order made' is 'loud and clear'.
She added: 'No apology has been made in relation to the breach of the order.'
Ms Stacey said the group had emailed National Highways in September saying the protests would continue 'unless the Government make a meaningful statement that they will start the process of decarbonising homes in Britain'. 
Ms Stacey said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27.  
She also said evidence is being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2. All nine defendants were sentenced by Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Chamberlain.
'Contempt of court' is an offence that normally happens when someone risks unfairly influencing a court case, which may stop somebody from getting a fair trial.
It can include taking photos or shouting out in court, refusing to answer questions as a witness or publicly commenting on a court case such as on social media.
Another form it takes is disobeying or ignoring a court order, which is what the Insulate Britain activists have done by breaking an injunction on their M25 protests.
Those who breach the injunctions were found in contempt of court and could have faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. In the end, they were jailed for between three and six months. 
The High Court has so far issued five injunctions to prevent protesters from blocking roads - four to National Highways and one to Transport for London (TfL).
The hearings did not taking place in a criminal court because none of the protesters have been charged with a criminal offence by police. This is despite at least 161 activists having been involved in the demonstrations over the two months, resulting in at least 860 arrests.
The protesters were instead facing contempt of court proceedings for breaching a High Court injunction, which is a civil matter but can still result in a jail term.
An emotional Mr Rock told LBC radio on Tuesday: 'I feel terrified - I'm c***ping myself this morning, and I feel like crying. I've got all these emotions coming out of me. It seems ridiculous that we're in this situation.
'What we're asking the Government to do is just an extremely practical no-brainer thing that they should be doing, and they're choosing instead to potentially lock us up, fine us, seize our assets.
'I'm expecting that we might get sentenced maybe today, probably tomorrow. We've been told that quite probably we'll get custodial sentences, so there's a high likelihood that by this evening I'll be in a prison cell somewhere.' 
The Government plans to introduce new measures to clamp down on protests, including allowing police to stop and search people where there is a reasonable suspicion they are carrying items intended to cause disturbance, such as glue.
After yesterday's sentencing a statement from the nine activists jailed was read by an Insulate Britain supporter outside the Royal Courts of Justice.
It read: 'Over the last nine weeks, 174 ordinary people have held the Government to account, asking that they deliver on their most basic of duties, to protect the British people, the economy and all we hold dear in our society.
'Your Government has now chosen to act. It has chosen to imprison us for this demand.
'By imprisoning us, the Government shows its cowardice. They would rather lock up pensioners than insulate their homes.
'They would rather lock up teachers than create thousands of proper jobs.
'They would rather lock up young people than take practical steps to reduce emissions.
'They will lock us up and leave thousands to die of cold this winter. We knew we would face prison when we took this action, but we could not stand by while the Government betrays the general public.' 
The activists' statement continued: 'Following the widely recognised failure of our Government at Cop26, we are continuing to ask them to get on with the job - of cutting carbon emissions, of insulating cold and leaky houses, of protecting the people of this country from climate collapse - because the lives of our children and those of all future generations hang in the balance.
'To the Government we say, you can't imprison a flood, there are no unlimited fines against a famine, you can't bankrupt a fire.

In the past, when governments have failed to protect their people the right thing to do is to highlight this injustice, breaking the law if needed, this is what the suffragettes and Martin Luther King did, and it is what Insulate Britain has done.
'We call on you to recognise that you also have a duty to act, as our Government is betraying us. They can't even act to insulate Britain. 
'What hope do we have of them protecting our children, our economy or our country?'
The statement concluded: 'We say to those who look on in fear and denial - this will impact you and all that you love, and look at what we did.
'A few hundred people captured the country's attention for months. Think what 1,000 people can achieve?
'You have a choice. To act, to come and join us help change the tide of history, or to be a bystander and be complicit in enabling genocide.
'This tide will not come again, will you join us?'
Following the sentencing, Greenpeace UK programme director Pat Venditti said: 'Jailing climate activists during a climate crisis is like silencing a smoke alarm while half the building is on fire.
'What this country needs are fewer injunctions and more insulation. Instead of cracking down on climate activism, the UK Government should crack down on cold homes.
'One will be an international embarrassment, the other a sign of real climate leadership.
'An ambitious home insulation programme funded by the Government would lower energy bills, cut planet-heating emissions and boost the UK's energy security - it's a triple win.
'Boris Johnson must show that he hasn't left his commitment behind at Glasgow Central station and he's ready to roll up sleeves and lead by example on tackling the climate crisis.'
Liberty director Gracie Bradley said: 'We should all be able to stand up for what we believe, but when the means to do so are continually narrowed - whether that be at the ballot box, in the courts or in the streets - people will take to more urgent routes.
'While Insulate Britain knew that by breaching the injunction they risked jail, these sentences clearly are disproportionate and another threat to protest rights for all of us.
'For years, injunctions have been used by the powerful to stifle dissent and restrict protest rights, while demonstrators have been demonised.
'The impact has been stifling free expression, undermining the ability of all of us to stand up for what we believe in - particularly people from marginalised communities who are most cut off from the corridors of power.
'Today's sentences must be seen in the context of the expansive and oppressive powers in the Policing Bill, itself a grab for more power by a Government that despises scrutiny and accountability.
'The right to protest protects all of us and is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. We must not allow those in power to demonise demonstrators in a cynical attempt to silence us all.'
Duncan Smith, executive director of operations at National Highways, said: 'Safety is our top priority and we welcome this outcome.
'We respect people's right to protest but do not condone the actions of anyone who puts their lives, and the lives of road users, at risk.
'The judge's decision will hopefully make people think again about carrying out reckless and dangerous protests such as these and endangering people's lives.
'The injunctions remain in place and we stand ready to do what is necessary to limit the impact of any protests on the strategic road network, and to keep drivers safe and on the move.'

70,"Britons travelling to China have been told by the UK Government to avoid wet markets — because of a rise in bird flu. 
In fresh advice issued today, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned the notorious markets were a 'source of infection'.   
Wet markets became the centre of international criticism last year after being touted as the epicentre of the Covid pandemic.
It is common for dozens of animals, dead and alive, to be kept dangerously close to one another in cramped cages at the markets.
The UKHSA said travellers to China and other Asian countries should also avoid live bird animal markets and poultry farms. 
Returning Britons should alert their GP if they experience flu-like symptoms within 10 days of coming home.
China is recording record numbers of the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza this year, with 22 confirmed so far - compared to just five last year.  
Dr Gavin Dabrera, an infectious diseases expert at UKHSA said: 'Anyone visiting China should avoid exposure to birds or live birds in ‘wet markets’ as a precaution.'
The cases of H5N6 in China this year have resulted in at least six deaths and left many of the remaining patients critically ill. 
Scientists estimate the substrain - which first emerged in the East Asian state Laos in 2013 - has a kill rate of 67 per cent.
The UKHSA said China claimed it had not recorded any cases of human-to-human transmission, and that the risk to the UK was 'very low'. 
Britons travelling to the area are also being advised not to handle undercooked or raw poultry, egg or duck dishes. 
Dr Dabrera added: 'We continue to encourage people to avoid touching dead or dying birds and maintain good hand hygiene while travelling. 
By Luke Andrews, Health Reporter 
Flu will make a comeback this winter after a year of Covid restrictions, a respiratory diseases scientist warned today.
Dr Beverly Taylor, who monitors emerging strains around the globe for the World Health Organization, said that cases have been rising globally and the UK can expect a bad bout this year.
She told a press conference: 'It definitely looks like influenza is on its way back. 
'The World Health Organization sends out a report every two weeks, and it shows a very slow but very steady increase in the number of samples positive for influenza.'  
Measures imposed to keep Covid at bay — including work from home and face masks — also helped to limit the spread of other respiratory diseases.
UK Health Security Agency surveillance shows flu cases are now rising slowly in Britain but remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Some 0.8 per cent of samples tested picked up flu last week (36 cases).
This was up from 0.4 per cent in the previous week (18 cases).
For comparison, in the same week in the year before the pandemic 3.4 per cent of samples tested positive for flu.
Dr Taylor is head of influenza scientific affairs at Britain's major manufacturer for seasonal flu jabs Seqirus.
'Avian influenza remains a risk in China and if travellers experience any flu like symptoms within 10 days of returning from China, they should call their GP or NHS 111 and report their recent travel. 
'UKHSA has arrangements in place to deal with emerging diseases. This includes the detection and investigation of suspected cases, and the management of confirmed cases and their contacts.'
A World Health Organization (WHO) expert said there was nothing to worry about yet because there is no sign the strain can spread between people.
But Dr Beverly Taylor, an influenza and vaccine expert, warned: 'We can't rule it out'. 
She told MailOnline: ' I think the key thing is we are not seeing human to human transmission. 
'Right now the risk is expected to be low but we cant rule it out.'
She suggested wet markets and other agricultural practices in China made it more prone than other countries to outbreaks.
She said: 'China does have — it always has — a higher number of cases than we see in other countries and part of that is the way we see people live there.
'There are live bird markets which we have seen the Chinese Government try to get control over and people living very closely with their domestic birds.' 
The Huanan Seafood Wholesale in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei Province, has been touted as the source of Covid.
A majority of the early cases were reported among people who had been shopping or working there.
Yet, despite testing markets, farms and no fewer than 80,000 animal samples spanning dozens of species across China, no evidence has emerged for a similar chain of early 'zoonotic' infections — transmitted from animals to humans — in SARS-CoV-2. 
Hundreds of samples taken from animal carcasses at the market have all tested negative for any trace of the virus.
And while the Chinese authorities have not revealed the professions of those who were earliest infected, we know that several of them, including the first known cases, had no exposure to the market whatsoever.
More recently, attentions have turned to a high-security biomedical lab in Wuhan, where it is feared the virus may have accidentally leaked from. ",-2
71,"True to form Labour has responded to the dropping of the eastern leg of HS2 from the West Midlands to Leeds by accusing ministers of abandoning the ‘Red Wall’ seats that helped deliver the 2019 Tories’ landslide election victory.
And the Opposition is not alone. Last night many Tory MPs and local leaders turned on the Prime Minister, accusing him of a great betrayal of the North.
Admittedly, the optics don’t look good for Boris Johnson, but the truth is that HS2 never was designed to help the former industrial heartlands of the Midlands and North. It was conceived to boost regional city centres rather than the poorer hinterlands such as Barnsley, Workington and Hartlepool.
The Integrated Rail Plan announced yesterday attempts to put that right. 
It is that rare beast: a slogan that looks like actually doing what it says. It will integrate new lines into the existing rail system, offering better services to towns and cities missing from the original HS2 blueprint.
On the plus side, the new plan will eliminate the biggest absurdity of HS2: the planned station between Derby and Nottingham which would have left passengers having to take a tram to either city.
HS2 trains will now serve Derby and Nottingham directly. That will mean longer journey times from London to Leeds, but in return HS2 trains will be accessible for far more people. 
As for abandoning plans for a 125mph Transpennine line from Manchester to Leeds, the fact that those two cities are only 35 miles apart meant that the need for such a fast line always was spurious.
The more modest improvements proposed will still reduce journey times from 55 minutes to 33 minutes – the 125mph line would have shaved only a further four minutes off the journey.
Moreover, a new tram system for Leeds should help more travellers link up with trains. There is no point in speeding from Manchester to Leeds in a few minutes if the onward journey to the Leeds suburbs takes 45 minutes on a bus. 
Critics have claimed that upgrading existing lines will do nothing to increase capacity, but they’re wrong.
The plans include laying extra tracks alongside existing lines, while new signalling will also help to make fuller use of existing tracks. The number of Transpennine services are expected to increase by a fifth.
That’s not to say there aren’t problems. The revised plans won’t pacify those who see HS2 as an extravagance from the start. Most of HS2 – the London to Birmingham and Birmingham to Manchester sections – are going ahead as planned. 
The price tag for the Integrated Rail Plan is put at £96billion which, on top of the £8.3billion already spent on HS2, works out at £104.3billion.
That’s not far short of the £107.92billion price tag put on HS2 by Lord Berkeley’s report last year. 
However, this figure also includes the cost of the Transpennine update, including stretches of new line between Manchester and Huddersfield, full electrification of the East Midlands main line, improvements to the East Coast mainline and a new tram system for Leeds.
According to the Department for Transport, the full HS2 scheme plus a high-speed Manchester to Leeds line and other electrification projects would have cost a staggering £185billion.
The more modest investment announced yesterday will raise objections from those who view building any new railways in Britain as too expensive at a time when the government is running a deficit of £234billion, and the move towards working from home has reduced demand for rail travel.
And while the revised plans ought to help Nottingham and Derby, Bradford will miss out on the new Transpennine line. Nor are there details of a proposed Leeds tram system (to which West Yorkshire taxpayers will have to chip in), so it is hard to say what difference it will make to that city’s transport.
As to whether HS2 trains will ever reach Leeds – the jury is still out. They could, in theory, either continue up existing lines north of Sheffield, or they could travel via Manchester – another option considered before the eastern leg of HS2 was chosen.
The maps in the Integrated Rail Plan, however, show Leeds being served by speeded-up trains on the existing East Coast line. It would take 113 minutes to travel from London to Leeds – 20 minutes quicker than now but far slower than the 81 minutes promised via the eastern leg of HS2.
The new plan proposes another study to explore the Leeds options further – but that is depressing in itself. 
While other countries plan infrastructure schemes and then build them, in Britain we spend years producing plans, studies and revised plans, holding inquiries and setting up commissions – all before a single spade is put into the ground.
The Integrated Rail Plan is closer to what ministers should have come up with in the beginning, but it is unlikely to be the last word on the matter. Watch this space for yet more ‘improvements’ and ‘rethinks’ before the first HS2 train takes to the rails.",-2
72,"The Remembrance Sunday bomb was packed with shrapnel and could have caused many casualties had it exploded properly, sources said yesterday.
Emad Al Swealmeen loaded the homemade device with nails and bolts – but it failed to fully detonate when it went off in a taxi outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital just before 11am on Sunday.
Experts believe if it had functioned as intended, metal fragments would have been flung in all directions, shredding the car and cutting down passers-by.
Forensic tests are expected to reveal why it failed.
The taxi’s driver David Perry is thought to have escaped serious injury because the blast was largely confined to the back seat before the vehicle erupted in flames.
Yesterday it emerged that Al Swealmeen, 32, had spent months trawling the internet to buy chemicals and metal components in small quantities to avoid detection.
The failed asylum seeker, who arrived in Britain from Iraq, is said to have had online shopping packages constantly arriving at his rented flat in Liverpool.
Officers have recovered traces of chemicals from the bomb factory indicating that he experimented with various explosives.
One of the recipes he is understood to have followed was for hexamethylene triperoxide diamine – the same material used by the July 7 2005 London bombers.
In previous terror attacks such as the Manchester Arena bombing and the Parsons Green tube explosion, key ingredients were bought on Amazon.
Yesterday, the company said it was checking to see if Al Swealmeen had bought chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide.
An Amazon spokesman said: ‘We only sell products that comply with UK laws. In addition, we also continue to work closely with police and law enforcement agencies.’
The motive for the attack remains unclear because officers have yet to access the bomber’s computers.
Al Swealmeen had converted to Christianity in Liverpool Cathedral and attended services in the suburb of Fazakerley until 2019. But he later dropped out of sight, according to the leaders of his local church.
Yesterday there were reports suggesting that he had regularly attended a local mosque.
Far-Right extremism has for the first time overtaken Islamism as the main reason for referrals to the Government’s anti-radicalisation programme Prevent, say official figures.
It was behind 1,229 referrals, about a quarter of the 4,915 made from April 2020 to March this year.
There were 1,064 about Islamism – 22 per cent. Most of the rest were for individuals with mixed, unstable or unclear ideologies.
The impact of coronavirus curbs led to a 22 per cent drop in referrals to Prevent, the first since records began in 2016. Under-20s account for 48 per cent of cases – and men for 88 per cent.",-2
73,"The Chinese military is now at or near the capability to invade Taiwan, according to a congressional report. 
'The PLA [People's Liberation Army] has already achieved the capabilities needed to conduct an air and naval blockade, cyberattacks, and missile strikes against Taiwan,' according to a report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressionally-appointed agency designated to provide national security and economic advice to Congress and the president. 
'PLA leaders now likely assess they have, or will soon have, the initial capability needed to conduct a high-risk invasion of Taiwan if ordered to do so by CCP leaders. They will continue enhancing this capability in the coming years.'
The report found that the PLA's current sea and air lift capacity could launch an initial landing force in Taiwan of at least 25,000 troops.   
'Given these developments, it has become less certain that U.S. conventional military forces alone will continue to deter China's leaders from initiating an attack on Taiwan,' the report found. 
The commission argued that China is most likely to invade Taiwan if it believes the US 'is not militarily capable of or politically willing to intervene, or if they interpret ambiguities in U.S. policy to mean that opportunistic Chinese aggression against Taiwan will not provoke a decisive U.S. response.'
The report found that Chinese President Xi Jinping had a high tolerance for risk and a desire to establish a lasting legacy, which could outweigh his concern for US warnings against attacking Taiwan.   
It found that China's nuclear buildup puts it on a trajectory to become the 'nuclear peer' of the US in quality, and a peer in quantity of land-based strategic missiles by 2030. 
The report warns that China could switch from a policy of nuclear deterrence to one of 'limited' nuclear first use.  
The US and its NATO allies formulate their nuclear policy on deterrence, meaning they build up weapons capabilities only to deter other nations from launching an attack, and only use their nuclear weapons if attacked first. First use would mean that China launches a nuclear weapon unprovoked to achieve a policy goal.
'Such a strategy would enable Chinese leaders to leverage their nuclear forces to accomplish Chinese political objectives beyond survival, such as coercing another state or deterring U.S. intervention in a war over Taiwan,' the report found. 
The report found that improved nuclear capabilities could encourage Chinese leaders to start a traditional war against US partners in the region, if they believe the US will stay away due to their nuclear capability. 
The report documents Chinese military training with barges, ferries and other civilian vessels to transport troops across the Taiwan Straits or elsewhere – in addition to conventional military transports. 
China considers Taiwan to be nothing more than an unruly extension of mainland territory. The US recognized the island democracy's autonomy until 1979, but the two nation's still enjoy a 'robust unofficial relationship.' 
In June, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that he did not believe China had the capability to invade Taiwan. 
'I think China has a ways to go to develop the actual, no-kidding capability to conduct military operations to seize through military means the entire island of Taiwan if they wanted to do that,' he said.
The White House has sent out confusing messages on its policy toward Taiwan, with President Biden first saying the US 'absolutely' had a duty to defend the island if it were attacked. Hours later, the president's press shop put out a statement saying there was no policy change, the US was still following the Taiwan Relations Act's policy of strategic ambiguity. 
Biden on Tuesday told a crowd he had made little progress to stop China's encroachment on Taiwan, but ruffled feathers in Beijing when he used the word 'independence.' 
'We made very clear we support the Taiwan Act, and that's it,' the president said. 'Its independence,' he added. 'It makes its own decisions.' 
The US does not officially support Taiwan's independence. 
That evening while touting the bipartisan infrastructure bill in New Hampshire, Biden said the US was not encouraging independence. 
'I said that they have to decide -- Taiwan, not us. We are not encouraging independence,' he said. 
'We're encouraging that they do exactly what the Taiwan Act requires,' he said, referring to the 1979 act governing Washington's relations with Taipei. 'That's what we're doing. Let them make up their mind. Period.' 
US officials tread lightly with a policy of strategic ambiguity, meaning they support Taiwan's ability to defend itself without explicitly promising to come to its aid in the event of Chinese attack. 
But, Taiwan's president recently confirmed for the first time that American troops are on the island of Taiwan training the Taiwanese military, and have been there for about a year.  
Chinese military forces held exercises last week near Taiwan in response to a visit by a U.S. congressional delegation to the island.
The state-run Xinhua news agency said Xi blamed recent tensions on attempts by Taiwan authorities to seek 'US. support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China.'
'Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,' Xi said.
 
White House readouts of the summit said Biden had affirmed the administration's 'one China' policy but warned against any change to the island's current status.
Meanwhile, a crackdown in Hong Kong, 'genocide' of the Uyghur minority and China's territorial ambitions in the Pacific Ocean, and its growing arsenal have cast the country as a growing challenge to Washington.   
But, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said this week that Beijing is ready to sit down for arms control talks with the US, a position they've rejected previously.  
Due to the the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) encroachment on the private sector, the report suggested that Congress take up legislation to deter US investors from pouring money into Chinese equity. 
It also called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require publicly traded companies to offer reporting on goods and services in their supply chain that could be linked to forced labor of the Uighur people in the Xinjiang province, and Customs and Border Patrol to place a hold on items originating in Xinjiang.  
It suggested Congress 'strengthen the credibility of US military deterrence' against an attack on Taiwan by building up military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region.    ",-2
74,"The charred remains of a 2,100-year-old Greek fortress have been unearthed in Israel and experts say the scene provides 'tangible evidence of the Hanukkah story.'
Hanukkah, an eight-day Jewish celebration, honors the rededication during the second century BC of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, where Jews rose up against their Greek-Syrian oppressors in the Maccabean Revolt – and this stronghold was destroyed by Jewish rebels during the uprising.
The fortress, measuring 50 feet by 50 feet, was constructed of stone walls nine feet thick before it was burned to the ground during the Hasmoneans and Seleucids battle.
Hasmonean was a dynasty of Jewish Kings who fought to liberate Judea from Seleucid rule, which was a Greek dynasty reigning over a large portion of the Middle East.
The ancient battle began when the Hasmoneans spotted Seleucid soldiers stationed in the fortress that sat on a hill overlooking a hill overlooking the Hellenistic city of Maresha.
No fighting was done inside the structure, but the Jewish rebels knock down the roof that led to the walls collapsing – and then they set their enemy fortress ablaze.

According to Saar Ganor, Vladik Lifshits, and Ahinoam Montagu, excavation directors on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, 'It appears that we have discovered a fortress, part of a fortified line erected by the Hellenistic army commanders, built to protect the large Hellenistic city of Maresha from Hasmonean offensive.
'Our theory is that the Seleucids blocked the entrance of the fortress and fled to the city as their enemies approached.'
Hanukkah commemorates the Maccabean, or Hasmonean, victories over the forces of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes who reigned from 175 to 164 BC and rededication of the Temple.
The revolt was led by Mattathias Maccabues and his son Judas, who were the first Jews who fought to defend their religious beliefs rather than their lives. of the restored Temple should be celebrated every year for eight days beginning on that date.
The Maccabean revolt led to the capture of Jerusalem, the reestablishment of Jewish worship in the Temple, and the Hasmonean dynasty that ruled Judea until about 67 BC.   
The fortress was divided into seven rooms and the walls still stand an impressive six feet even after crumbling thousands of years ago.
In addition, the excavation uncovered a stairwell leading to a second floor, which was not preserved.
While moving mounds of dirt away from the ruins, archaeologists uncovered thousands of collapsed stones that revealed a massive one-foot-thick destruction layer that held hundreds of artifacts dating to the late second century BC.
The team pulled troves of pottery, slingshots, iron weapons, burnt wooden beams and dozens of coins from the site.
'Based on the finds and coins, the building's destruction can be attributed to the Idumea led by the Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus around 112 BCE,' the archaeologists said in a statement.
Hyrcanus, a high priest and ruler of the Jewish nation, was a son of Simon Maccabeus who was the youngest son of Mattathias Maccabeus.
IAA general director, Eli Eskozido said in a statement: 'he stories of the Maccabees are coming to life before our eyes, and this is the most fascinating part of the Israel Antiquities Authority's work, when dedicated, hardworking archaeologists breathe life into the historical annals of the people who passed through this land.
'In a few days, we will be celebrating Hanukkah, whose central theme is the Hasmoneans' defeat of the Hellenists, leading to the establishment of the first independent sovereign Jewish entity. 
'The Hasmoneans could have had no idea that 2,000 years later, students living in the State of Israel would be following in their footsteps. It is extremely exciting.'",-2
75,"A Labour MP refused to withdraw the word 'dodgy' three times in the Commons today, as she claimed she did not think 'another word suffices the level of corruption and what we have seen from the Government'.
During business questions in the Commons, the MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana, accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg of being 'dodgy'.
Ms Sultana said: 'It has been reported that the Transport Secretary used public money to create a departmental team that lobbied against plans to build on airfield sites, including a giga-factory at Coventry Airport.
'Disgracefully, that would mean he used public funds to lobby against green investment and jobs coming to Coventry.
'And why? We know he is an aviation enthusiast. From a dodgy Transport Secretary to a dodgy Leader of the House who last week tried to rewrite the rules to let his mate off the hook. 
'This Conservative Government is rotten to the core. Is the Leader of the House proud of this shameful record?'
Interjecting, Commons Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing told her to think of a different form of words, as she did not like the word 'dodgy'.
She said: 'She can make clear she disagrees with what has happened. Perhaps she could put it in different words.'
Confusing Madam Deputy Speaker for Madam Deputy Secretary, Ms Sultana replied: 'Thank you, Madam Deputy Secretary. 
'I don't think another word suffices the level of corruption and what we have seen from this Government, so I think that term suffices.'
Dame Eleanor insisted that while 'it is absolutely in order to have disagreement here', we must 'moderate our language and be careful of the adjectives that are used about a member by another'.
The MP for Coventry South claimed once again to be 'confused' as she could not think of a different word.
Dame Eleanor said it would suffice to withdraw the word 'dodgy' to ask her question, but this went ignored, and then the Deputy Commons Speaker seemed to lose her patience.
Raising her voice, she said: 'Order! Order! She misunderstands me, I am asking her to withdraw the word 'dodgy'. I have given her the opportunity to put her question in other words. If she doesn't want to take that opportunity, she doesn't have to.
'I am not stopping her from making the point she wants to make or asking the Leader of the House the question she wants to ask and indeed drawing to general attention the points that she wishes to draw general attention. 
'I am asking her to moderate language in doing so. Would she like to put her question in moderate language?'
Ms Sultana finally withdrew her remarks, but decided not to re-ask her question to the Commons Leader with 'moderate language'.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps was accused on Sunday of fighting plans by his own Government to build homes on little-used airfields.
Mr Shapps, a keen pilot said to own his own £100,000 aircraft, is said to have used a lobbying body to protect airfields from development.
He disputes claims made in the Sunday Times that he 'set-up and diverted public money' to a new team within the Civil Aviation Authority designed to lobby against planning developments that infringe on airstrips.
The newspaper said objections by the Airfield Advisory Team had helped to frustrate Homes England's plans for 3,000 homes at Chalgrove, an airfield in south Oxfordshire, while also opposing ambitions to build a battery gigafactory on Coventry airport.
But Department for Transport (DfT) officials said the team was not a lobbying body and instead provided 'support to general aviation on a range of matters affecting their operations'.
A Government source said: 'This body is not a lobbying body, it is an advisory body to help general aviation with problems they may have, which may be planning or anything else.
'It is not essentially anti-housing - indeed, housing can sometimes be a solution for financing an airfield.
'As Secretary of State for Transport, it is his function to protect general aviation and we've seen a decline in the number of airfields across the country.'
A DfT spokeswoman said: 'It is right that the Transport Secretary works to promote all aspects of the department's brief including the general aviation sector, which contributes £4 billion to the economy and supports 40,000 jobs, especially as we focus on our recovery from the pandemic and on building a diverse workforce that's fit for the future.'
The Sunday Times article also suggested Mr Shapps' flying hobby had 'undermined' Government efforts to repatriate Britons after the collapse of travel agent Thomas Cook in 2019, and had taken up 'valuable time' while the DfT dealt with post-Brexit and coronavirus travel disruption.
But a source said claims were 'utterly bogus and demonstrably false'.
Mr Shapps is believed to have held a pilot's licence since 1995, before he entered Parliament. 
In 2017, while out of Government, he was elected chairman of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Aviation. On taking on the role he said: 'Grant Shapps said: “The All-Party Parliamentary Group on General Aviation seeks to be the strong voice in Parliament that general aviation needs to help promote jobs and growth in this country. 
'We will seek to do this by inspiring young and old to look to the skies to help develop the kind of high-tech jobs and skills we all want to see. I am delighted to have been elected chair and look forward to championing such an important part of our economy.'
He resigned the role on becoming Secretary of State for Transport in place of Chris Grayling in 2019. ",-2
76,"Sean Penn has been pictured donning combat gear and a helmet as he arrived in Ukraine to film a documentary about Russian aggression in the region.
The Hollywood actor and producer, 61, met with Ukrainian military service personnel as he visited positions near the frontline with Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk area.
Ukraine has been fighting a years-long proxy-war against Russia, which supports separatist rebels in the country's eastern regions. 
It is understood Penn is shoot a documentary about how the Donbas region has been impacted by battles with pro-Moscow rebels.
He was followed by a camera crew and surrounded by military protection as he made the visit on Thursday.
The proxy-war stems from the 2014 rebellion which ousted pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych and led to Russian annexing Crimea in the aftermath.
The conflict has so-far claimed some 13,000 lives.
Crimea juts into the Black Sea and contains an important Russian naval port with easy access to the Mediterranean.
A post on the Joint Forces Operation Headquarters Facebook page on Thursday said Penn was visiting 'to see with his own eyes the consequences of Russian aggression'.
The post added that the idea of the documentary was to 'tell the general public about the events that are currently happening in our country'.
The actor made the visit to the settlement of Priazov, which has been at the forefront of the ongoing conflict.
Penn rose to fame as a leading actor with the drama Dead Man Walking in 1995, before winning two Academy Awards for his roles in Mystic River in 2003, followed by Milk in 2008. 
His arrival in the region came as Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the West of 'escalating' tensions around Ukraine by building up forces on his border, even as thousands of Russian troops, tanks and artillery pieces sit close by.
The Russian president said Europe and the US had carried out ship drills in the Black Sea and flown bombers close to the frontier - crossing 'red lines' and showing that Russia is not being taken seriously.
As he spoke, the Russian military test-fired an 'unstoppable' hypersonic Zircon missile at a target in the White Sea - saying it scored a direct hit.
He said: 'Western partners are escalating the situation by supplying Kiev with lethal modern weapons.' 
The comments were made after Ukraine's defence minister revealed he has asked Brussels and Washington for more military tech.
Putin said Moscow has been 'constantly raising concerns about this' but 'all our warnings and talk about red lines are treated superficially'.
Putin has been voicing concern about US naval exercises in the Black Sea for days, telling his French counterpart this week that they were 'provocative' and leading to 'increasing tensions' between Moscow and NATO.
He has also slammed Ukraine for using a Turkish-made drone against pro-Moscow rebels.
Meanwhile, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said he is in the process of agreeing a 'Russian containment package' with allies in Washington and Brussels including 'increased sanctions' as well as 'supplies of additional weapons'.",-2
77,"Boris Johnson is facing mounting Tory unrest over 'unforced errors' today as a poll found nearly two-thirds of the public believe he should apologise for the Owen Paterson shambles.
The PM delivered a mea culpa to his own MPs last night admitting he 'crashed the car' with the extraordinary bid to save the ex-minister by pausing the Commons standards regime.
But research by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for MailOnline found that 63 per cent of the public think he should have said sorry - something he has pointedly refused to do.
Despite the government's 80-strong majority, there are growing signs of discontent on the Conservative benches at the premier's record of blunders and U-turns - which seems to be starting to hit support among voters. 
There appeared to be a thin Tory attendance at the weekly PMQs session yesterday, which is usually an opportunity for raucous shows of support.
And not all MPs turned up last night for votes on triggering a process of reform for rules on conduct and second jobs, which many politicians regard as 'knee-jerk' and impossible to implement.
The government is fending off more Red Wall anger today as HS2 and Northern Powerhouse links to Leeds have been dropped from a huge package of 'Levelling Up' rail improvements.  
One senior Conservative told MailOnline that Mr Johnson needs to mount a charm offensive on the 2019 intake, with fears they have not been integrated into the party due to the pandemic. He has already hosted a drinks reception at No10 in a bid to 'reach out' which is said to have 'gone well'.
'Colleagues are being dragooned into voting in particular ways without consideration of the damage that can be done... There is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with where we are.
'He has burned through political capital and it is unnecessary. When you have to do things that are difficult that is fine.
'But if you fail to spot things that is a problem. They hadn't spotted it and then they panicked.'
The MP said Mr Johnson had made the 'right call' by coming to speak to the Tory backbench 1922 committee last night - but pointed out that only around 150 politicians were there, out of around 365.
'The PM has seen a large number of colleagues but by no means the full parliamentary party,' they said.
'We have got to bring people back together. The PM has already started reaching out, he had the 2019 intake for drinks the other night. He is doing that for all sections of the party basically.
'We haven't been able to go to No10 since the general election really… he wasn't able to do what he would normally do, which is have receptions for colleagues.' 
Redfield & Wilton surveyed 1,500 people online yesterday, with the results weighted to represent the wider population.
A third 'strongly' agreed with the statement that Mr Johnson should have apologised for attempting to change the standards system in response to the Paterson case.
Another 30 per cent agreed - and only 6 per cent disagreed.  
At a private meeting of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee last night, Mr Johnson took responsibility for the Government's botched attempt to get Owen Paterson off the hook after he was found to have broken the rules on paid lobbying.
'On a clear day I crashed the car into a ditch. I will get the car out of the ditch,' he reportedly told the gathering.
In a round of interviews this morning, Deputy PM Dominic Raab conceded that Tories were 'disgrunted' but insisted ministers are committed to 'fixing the problem'. 
Asked on Sky News about discontent within the party, he said there is always 'one or other disgruntled individual' who is prepared to complain anonymously in the media.
Pressed on whether that means there is no general unrest, Mr Raab added: 'Not sure I'd put it in that idyllic way. There's always debate amongst MPs, but the most important thing is we're fixing the problem.'
On Wednesday, the Commons backed Mr Johnson's proposals to ban MPs from taking paid political consultancies and to limit the time they can spend doing second jobs.
However just 297 MPs – fewer than half the total – voted for the motion, with opposition parties abstaining.
Four Tory MPs even voted for a rival Labour motion which would have imposed a clear parliamentary timetable for implementing reform.
Former Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the PM had been poorly advised when it came to reforming the standards system.
He told ITV's Peston: 'It has been a very difficult two weeks and almost everyone involved would agree that it's been handled poorly by the Government and it's damaged the Government to an extent, and it's damaged Parliament as well.
'We need to take action now to restore a degree of public trust in the standards in public life, and what you would expect from a Member of Parliament.'
Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said there is a lack of urgency from the Government when it comes to dealing with the issue.
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning: 'The problem with the amendment from the Government which was passed yesterday is that there is no timetable.
'It wasn't a binding vote and, as a result, I just fear it is going to be kicked further into the long grass rather than the fundamental reform that people want and need to see now to restore confidence in our parliamentary democracy.
'I think that public service and being an MP is something that I am proud of and I think most MPs are, but at the moment you don't feel that proud. People look at MPs and just think it is just mired in sleaze.
'I think we need to sort this out quickly to restore the reputation of Parliament.
'It seems that Government just don't have that sense of urgency about restoring people's faith and trust in our parliamentary democracy.' 
Mr Johnson's appearance before the 1922 Committee was the culmination of weeks of pressure following the fiasco over the attempt to save Mr Paterson from suspension.
The former Cabinet minister had been found to have breached lobbying rules by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards but a Government-backed amendment attempted to save him from suspension and overhaul the whole standards process.
The Government U-turned on the idea after a backlash and Mr Paterson resigned as an MP, but the saga kicked off a deep dive into standards in public life, with a focus on second jobs.
Appearing before the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday, Mr Johnson admitted the initial effort to shield Mr Paterson had been an error.
'The intention genuinely was not to exonerate anybody, the intention was to see whether there was some way in which, on a cross-party basis, we could improve the system,' he said.
'In retrospect it was obviously, obviously mistaken to think we could conflate the two things and do I regret that decision? Yes I certainly do.'",-2
78,"Apple, which is rapidly losing ground in the electric vehicle industry to Tesla, GM, Ford and other automakers, is looking to have the 'holy grail' option for its autonomous car by 2025: no human intervention at all.
The lack of human intervention, which is being pushed by the project's new boss, Kevin Lynch (who previously led the company's Apple Watch software efforts) would be something that no automaker has yet to achieve, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news.
Tesla, for all the publicity surrounding the Elon Musk-led company, has come under fire from consumers and lawmakers over its autopilot system and how it works.
In August, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the system over 11 accidents - one deadly - feared to have been caused because the system has trouble spotting parked emergency vehicles. 
Other automakers, such as GM and its Cruise unit, Ford and newly public Rivian, do not yet offer completely autonomous capabilities.
Waymo, which recently said it was helping UPS deliver packages for the holiday season, has demonstrated some autonomous capabilities, but there is still human surveillance. 
Prior to Lynch's arrival in the car-related project, which occurred in July, the $2 trillion tech giant had been pursuing a path of creating a car with limited self-driving capabilities, as well as one with fully autonomous capabilities. 
In September, Doug Field, who had been leading the team prior to Lynch's arrival, left the Special Projects Group (also known as Project Titan) for a similar job at Ford.  
The ambitious timing of getting a car on the road in four years is faster than the five-to-seven target some engineers had previously stated, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the thinking.
The fully self-driving car could have a radically different design and may feature no steering wheel or pedals, Bloomberg noted.
It may have an emergency takeover mode even if it does not have a traditional steering wheel, the news outlet added. 
The vehicle could also offer an option that passengers sit on the sides of the vehicle, as they do in the back of limousines or on some buses.
By having a completely self-driving car, it is going after a 'holy grail' in the automotive and tech industries, Bloomberg reported, as both areas have chased the prospect for years to varying degrees of success. 
In addition to the radical redesign of the interior, Apple could also change the infotainment system of its electric vehicle, similar to how Tesla's Model 3 has an iPad-like touch screen in the middle, removing the traditional dashboard.
The car is also likely to integrate Apple's other products and services. 
If indeed Apple achieves this goal, it would be considered Level 5 (the highest level) autonomous driving, which could pose a problem depending upon the state.
'Some states require a human operator to have one hand on the steering wheel at all times – a law that would pose a barrier to Level 3 through Level 5 ADSs,' the NHTSA said in a safety document. 
Level 5, considered to be full automation, denotes that the vehicle is 'capable of performing all driving functions under all conditions,' according to the NHTSA. 'The driver may have the option to control the vehicle.' 
Other levels of automation - Levels 1 through 4 - vary in some degrees. 
Level 3 is deemed as 'conditional automation,' where the driver is a necessity but not required to monitor the environment.
Conversely, Level 4 is known as 'high automation,'  where the vehicle is capable of all driving functions under certain conditions. 
In a note to investors, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the 2025 timeline is in line with his thinking and could be a significant driver for the company over the next few years as the electric vehicle industry transformation happens.
'We continue to believe its a matter of when, not if, Apple enters the EV race and this will add another $30+ per share of [total addressable market] to the Apple growth story over the next few years given the golden age of EV transformation on the horizon,' Ives wrote in the report.
Earlier this month, Apple reportedly hired Christopher Moore, a former Tesla Autopilot software director, who had a disagreement with Musk. 
Apple has not responded to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. 
In September, the company reportedly met with Toyota in Japan to build the car.  
The Cupertino, California-based Apple has long been rumored to be working on a passenger vehicle.
In December 2020, Reuters reported that Apple's Car would include a new 'breakthrough battery technology',' known as 'monocell,' that could radically reduce cost and increase the vehicle's range before a recharge is needed.
A Reuters source said the technology is 'next level,' adding it is like 'the first time you saw the iPhone.'
It remains unclear who would assemble such a car, but analysts have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles.
'We continue to strongly believe Apple ultimately announces an EV strategic partnership in 2021 that lays the groundwork to enter the burgeoning EV space,' Wedbush analysts said in a note to investors earlier this year.
In February, Bloomberg reported that Apple has an initial target of 100,000 cars per year, a far cry from the 1.6 billion Apple devices in active use CEO Tim Cook told investors earlier this year. 
TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously said the car would have a 300 mile range and go from 0 to 60 in less than 3.5 seconds.
Cook, who helms the normally secretive company, confirmed in 2017 that Apple was working on a car-related project.
'We're focusing on… what we talked about we're focusing on publicly is… We're focusing on autonomous systems,' Cook said in an interview with Bloomberg.
'Clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars — there are others. And we sort of see it as the mother all AI projects.'
'It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on. So autonomy is something that is incredibly exciting for us. But we'll see where it takes us — we're not really saying from a product point of view what we'll do. It's a core technology that we view as very important.' ",-2
79,"In a troubling sign for Democrats, President Joe Biden's approval rating dropped to 36 per cent in a new poll out Thursday and most voters said they want to see Republicans take control of Congress.
The new numbers - from a Quinnipiac University Poll - indicate a level of frustration among voters with the party in power as the country prepares for next year's midterm election.
Only 36 per cent in the poll approved of the job President Biden is doing while 53 per cent disapproved. It's the lowest job approval rating he's received in a Quinnipiac University poll.
Biden's approval rating has been on a downward slide in the month of November, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. A CNN poll at the start of the month had his approval rating at 45 per cent.
In the Quinnipiac poll, 46 per cent said they want to see Republicans win control of the House - compared to 38 per cent who want Democrats -- and 46 per cent want the GOP in the charge of the Senate, compared to 40 per cent who favor Democrats.
Independent voters, who typically decide matters in elections, also want to see Republicans in charge of Congress: 41 per cent to 31 per cent  for the House and 44 per cent to 34 per cent for the Senate. 
Additionally, a slight majority of Americans - 52 per cent - said the Democratic Party has moved to the left. 
Historically, the president's party tends to do badly in the first midterms after they take office. Both Barack Obama and Donald Trump saw their respective parties lose control of the House of Representatives in their first midterms - 2010 and 2018. 
Republicans only need to win four House seats to take control of the lower chamber of Congress. 
And 15 House Democrats have already announced their retirement or a run for another office this cycle. The House is also undergoing the redistricting process, which is expected to favor Republicans. 
The Senate is an even 50-50 split but most of the competitive races are in states Biden carried in the 2020 election, which is keeping Democratic hopes up. 
But their loss in Virginia's gubenatorial campaign this month - where Democrat Terry McAuliffe fell to Republican Glenn Youngkin - has Republican hopes rising they can take control of Congress next year. 
Biden won Virginia with 10 points in 2020.
Republicans hadn't won statewide in Virginia since 2009. That year Bob McDonnell was able to capitalize on a backlash against Barack Obama's presidential win to take the state. His victory preceded a GOP wave that gave Republicans control of the House in the 2010 midterms.
Youngkin won with a surge of support from white women and, more critically, the suburban areas that tend to decide elections.  Youngkin carried the suburbs 53% to McAuliffe's 47%. In 2020, Biden carried those same suburbs 53% to Donald Trump's 45%.",-2
80,"Rodents may be asymptomatic carries of SARS-like viruses, a study has warned — meaning the the 'next COVID-19' may well come from rats.
Researchers from Princeton University performed a genomic analysis of various mammal species, looking specifically at the receptors that SARS viruses bind to.
They found evidence that some rodent species in the past were repeatedly exposed to SARS-like coronaviruses, leading them to likely evolve a certain level of resistance.
SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 infection — is 'zoonotic', meaning that it jumped from a non-human animal into humans.
And previous research has shown that Chinese horseshoe bats can play host to numerous SARS-like without themselves showing extreme symptoms.
Identifying animals that may have similar protections against such infections — and could thus serve as viral reservoirs — is vital for preventing future pandemics.
The study was conducted by molecular biologist Sean King and computer scientist Mona Singh of New Jersey's Princeton University. 
'Our study suggests that ancestral rodents may have had repeated infections with SARS-like coronaviruses,' the duo wrote in their paper.
This, they added, likely have allowed them to acquire 'some form of tolerance or resistance to SARS-like coronaviruses as a result of these infections.
'This raises the tantalizing possibility that some modern rodent species may be asymptomatic carriers of SARS-like coronaviruses — including those that may not have been discovered yet.' 
In their investigation, Dr King and Professor Singh studied the so-called ACE2 receptors that SARS viruses use to gain entry into mammalian cells — characterising the evolution of the receptors across different mammal species.
The team found that primates and other mammals not already known to be SARS hosts tended to have little evidence of past adaptation in the ACE2 receptors, which is what today leaves us vulnerable to symptomatic cases of the disease.
Among rodents, however, the duo's genomic analysis exposed a pattern of rapid evolution in the ACE2 binding interface — evidence by a greater diversity in the amino acid sequences that code for the receptor.
This suggests that some rodent species were likely exposed to SARS-like coronaviruses repeatedly over the course their evolution and, as a consequence, that they may have acquired a form of tolerance to these types of infections. 

'Continuing to explore adaptations in coronavirus animal hosts will be important […] for understanding which animals have possibly adapted tolerance mechanisms through ancient exposures and may be carriers of SARS-like viruses,' the duo began.
Such studies, they continued, will also aid us in 'finding those that are vulnerable symptomatic hosts, as humans have unfortunately proven to be.'
The full findings of the study were published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.  
Zoonotic diseases are able to pass from one species to another.
The infecting agent - called a pathogen - in these diseases is able to cross the species border and still survive. 
They range in potency, and are often less dangerous in one species than they are in another. 
In order to be successful they rely on long and direct contact with different animals.  
Common examples are the strains of influenza that have adapted to survive in humans from various different host animals. 
H5N1, H7N9 and H5N6 are all strains of avian influenza which originated in birds and infected humans.
These cases are rare but outbreaks do occur when a person has prolonged, direct exposure with infected animals. 
The flu strain is also incapable of passing from human to human once a person is infected.  
A 2009 outbreak of swine flu - H1N1 - was considered a pandemic and governments spent millions developing 'tamiflu' to stop the spread of the disease. 
Influenza is zoonotic because, as a virus, it can rapidly evolve and change its shape and structure.  
There are examples of other zoonotic diseases, such as chlamydia. 
Chlamydia is a bacteria that has many different strains in the general family. 
This has been known to happen with some specific strains, Chlamydia abortus for example.
This specific bacteria can cause abortion in small ruminants, and if transmitted to a human can result in abortions, premature births and life-threatening illnesses in pregnant women.",-2
81,"Two people were killed and and four others had to be rescued after they became trapped on the top floor of an empty house they used for a drug-fuelled sex party, a court has heard.
Jurors were told that a 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old mother-of-three died from smoke inhalation and a second woman had to be treated in intensive care after two mattresses and a chair were set on fire 'deliberately' at a house in Huddersfield in March.
Craig Collier, 35, is charged with the murder of Samantha Mills and Reece Schofield who both died days after the terrifying fire, Leeds Crown Court heard.
He is also charged with four counts of attempted murder, one count of arson with intent to endanger life and one count of perverting the course of justice. Mr Collier denies all eight charges.
The court heard the property in Clare Hill was unoccupied at the time but had previously been used by the homeless as a venue for 'drug taking and drinking'.
Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC opened the case and told jurors that six people visited the house on March 23 and engaged in 'drug taking and consensual intimate activity' when they became trapped on the top floor.
Three of those partygoers managed to escape through the skylight of the property, but three others, including Ms Mills and Mr Schofield, were unable to do so.
Another woman was rescued by firefighters and taken to intensive care where she later recovered.
Mr Moulson said: 'All of the matters arise as a result of what the crown contends was the deliberate setting on fire of a house in Clare Hill, in Huddersfield, we submit by this defendant on March 23, 2021.'
He went on to say the property at 17 Clare Hill was 'generally occupied' but regularly used by the homeless and others 'apparently involved in drinking and taking drugs'.
Mr Moulson added that the nearby Cambridge Hotel, opposite the house in question, is used by those in need of accommodation and it was at this hotel that Mr Collier lived.
At around 5.30am on March 23, six people were on the upper floor of the house engaged in 'drug taking and consensual intimate activity'.
Mr Moulson said: 'It is the prosecution's case that three separate fires were deliberately set inside that building by a seventh and only person in the building at that time, namely this defendant Craig Collier.'
He added that Mr Collier was not engaged in either the drug taking or sex activity and returned to his room at the Cambridge Hotel after the setting of the fire.
Mr Moulson said: 'A mattress we say was set on fire by the defendant.
'We contend he then moved to the floor below that floor on the ground floor where he set fire to a further mattress in a room on that floor.
'Then while on that same floor he moved a chair to behind the front door and set fire to that before leaving through that door and going to his room at the Cambridge Hotel.'
He added: 'As a result of those three fires in the positions below where those other six were, they had no option other than to attempt to escape through a skylight or attic window.'
Fire crews attended and three of those people, including Ms Mills, Mr Schofield and another woman, did not make it to the temporary safety of the roof.
Mr Moulson told jurors: 'All of them were rescued at the time alive from within that attic bedroom as a result of the bravery of the attending fire crews.
'Samantha Mills and Reece Schofield, despite the best efforts of those concerned with their rescue and subsequent medical treatment, ultimately died respectively on the 26 and 29 March.
'The cause of death in each of them was inhalation of the products of combustion.
'The third person rescued was admitted to intensive care and ultimately recovered from the effects of the fire upon her.'
Mr Moulson added that three others escaped 'relatively uninjured'.
Mr Collier denies two counts of murder, four charges of attempted murder, one count of arson with intent to endanger life and one count of perverting the course of justice.
The trial continues.",-2
82,"A secret staging area used by people smugglers to assemble groups of migrants and prepare inflatable boats to carry them across the English Channel has been uncovered by MailOnline. 
The site where migrants appear to have spent their last night in France is hidden in sand dunes under the noses of patrolling French police near Wimereux, around 20 miles south of Calais. 
Piles of abandoned lifejackets, clothing, sleeping bags and left over food from final meals eaten on French soil were spread out on the area of sand around 100 yards from the beach. 
Foot pumps for inflatable boats were also found at the scene along with flooring panels which are designed to slot together and add stability to the flimsy vessels carrying migrants to the UK. 
The spot is in a sheltered hollow and cannot be seen from the beach which was being patrolled by a dozen French police in the early morning darkness and as the sun came up this morning. 
People smugglers are able to keep watch from the vantage point and can decide when the moment is right for migrants to help manhandle their boats down a sandy cliff and begin their perilous voyage. 
The site is also in the area where MailOnline witnessed two giant 50ft long inflatable boats – each packed with around 40 migrants – being pushed out into the surf by people smugglers on Tuesday morning. 
Ripped up sacks were found littered around the site after apparently being used as ground sheets to rest on, along with blankets and up to a dozen sleeping bags including some still in their carrying bags. 
One of the most pitiful sights was a girl’s jacket and a child’s cuddly toy grey owl, apparently abandoned or lost.
Evidence of food and drink consumed included packets of praline waffles, crisps, Oreo biscuits, miniature muffins, tins of mackerel and tuna, alongside empty cans of energy drinks and oat milk cartons. 
There was also an empty box of condoms, possibly used by migrants to make waterproof covers for precious mobile phones or to inflate to provide extra buoyancy for bags before they go to sea. 
Two rolls of clingfilm abandoned at the scene could also have been used to wrap up and waterproof possessions.
Lifejackets lying around included a bright orange one for a child with a label saying it had been manufactured in Izmir, Turkey, suggesting that it had earlier been purchased for an illicit boat trip from Turkey to Europe. 
An empty plastic container of 10W-40 motor oil for an outboard engine was discarded at the spot along with a hand operated Itiwit pump for putting air into inflatable chambers on a boat. 
There were also four 4ft wide panels, with metal edging designed to slot together, to provide strengthened flooring for a boat. 
No migrant boats were seen setting off from beaches in the area this morning after French police stepped up patrols following MailOnline’s images of the giant craft full of migrants being launched on Tuesday. 
Officers with torches and carrying a gun to fire runner bullets were seen probing the sand dunes in the darkness this morning, and walking up and down the beach as Coastguards with searchlights kept watch from a boat offshore. 
A MailOnline reporter also found the deflated remains of a large black inflatable boat on the beach after it was washed up at high tide. 
French police officers were seen examining the item of nautical debris and giving it a cursory kick as they walked past it at the high water mark.
It is not known if the boat was abandoned at sea after migrants were picked up by French authorities, or if it came to grief in a failed launching attempt on the beach.
MailOnlne found a similar deflated giant inflatable with large gashes in its buoyancy chambers washed up on rocks at the same beach earlier this week. 
The migrants who set sail on Tuesday morning are thought to have spent Monday night hiding in sand dunes overlooking the two beaches where they left from.
They were seen manhandling the inflatables down clifftops as early morning French dog walkers and a jogger watched in amazement. 
People smuggling minders were spotted wading knee deep in the sea and then running back to shore after the migrants clambered aboard. 
There where cheers and whoops from one boat as they started their Yamaha outboard engine and headed out into the surf, intent on a new life in the UK. 
Most of the two groups were seen wearing bright orange life jackets although a few did not have any buoyancy aids. 
The incredible scenes unfolded without a single police officer being seen anywhere in the area, despite the French authorities having pledged to crack down on migrant boats. 
Officers were back patrolling beaches in the area on Wednesday, albeit 24 hours too late to prevent the flotilla setting off a day earlier. 
MailOnline earlier witnessed lifejackets being openly handed out on Monday afternoon at the makshift migrant camp in Grand Synthe near Dunkirk which was closed down by hundreds of French police on Tuesday morning. 
Groups of men were seen arriving with bags crammed full of the brand new bright orange lifejackets as charities gave out free food and medication on Monday afternoon. 
Later several groups of migrants were seen waiting at a nearby bus stop opposite an Auchan superstore, carrying their lifejackets in bags. 
Scores of migrants were seen arriving on Monday evening in Wimereux around 40 miles south of Grand Synthe, and walking through the town centre towards the beach. 
Some had huge backpacks stuffed with their meagre possessions, and apparently hiding their lifejackets. 
The excited chatter of a migrant group was heard on the beach in the darkness as one boat set off before dawn. 
The two big boats later launched in daylight after lookouts decided that the coast was clear and no police were around.
Bon voyage! French cops stand and watch as cheering migrants launch another dinghy into the channel - on the day 1,000 more migrants made it to the UK
Migrants have been filmed cheering and clapping as they launched dinghies off the coast of France to cross the English Channel as French police officers stood by and filmed the scenes.
Video footage taken on Tuesday - the same day that a staggering 1,000 migrants made it to the UK - showed groups of migrants, including young children, clapping in celebration as they managed to restart their boat's engine on a Calais beach.
In the clip, taken by local jogger Franck Viandier, dozens of migrants crowded around the small boat and helped to push it into the water while children clapped and cheered with excitement as they prepared to cross the Channel.
Other footage obtained by ITV News showed dozens of migrants wearing life jackets carrying a small dinghy down to the sea while French Gendarmerie officers stood by on the shore and watched.
Some officers appeared to be holding up their phones and filming the scenes, while others stood by and did not intervene as the migrants prepared to launch a boat, heading for the UK. 
On Tuesday, MailOnline journalists witnessed two 50ft long boats, setting off from the beaches near Wimereux, around 20 mile south of Calais. No police were on the beach at the time - but turned up some 24 hours later.  
Today, the RNLI rescued 23 migrants before around 50 more arrived in Kent. More people are expected to make the dangerous 21-mile trip across the Dover Strait throughout the day as weather is said to be good in the Channel.
A lifeboat was scrambled this morning to rescue people from a boat in the Channel, with one migrant airlifted to hospital after suffering a suspected medical episode while attempting the crossing. The man, who was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, is believed to be okay. 
Mr Viandier, who jogs along a Calais beach every morning, said he believes the Gendarmerie officers are doing their best amid the migrant crisis, saying that it is not 'their job' to fight migrants if they want to cross to England.
He told ITV News: 'Sometimes there is a lot of police, I can see the fight sometimes. But they say to me 'it is not our job to fight with these people, the people want to go to England, we are French police'.'
France claims that it deploys 950 officers in the Calais region each day in a bid to prevent illegal Channel crossings. 
Migrants launch their boats from France along a 100mile stretch of beach, making it harder for authorities to stop them from crossing the Channel. Out of 40,000 crossings this year, only around half were stopped, according to official figures.
Meanwhile, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said the UK's offer to set up joint patrols with the French was rebuffed.
He added: 'We constantly discuss operational options with the French, we have offered to conduct joint patrols. It's not an offer that the French have currently taken us up on, but it continues to be on the table.' 
Official figures are yet to be released but it is feared that Tuesday's total could rival the 1,185 record reached last Thursday as the migrant crisis reaches breaking point. The figures have taken some two days to calculate due to the sheer number of arrivals.
The previous daily high was 853. At least 3,941 migrants have arrived this month in 121 boats, taking the total for the year so far to 23,683.
This morning, an RNLI Dover lifeboat was launched just after 5.30am at the request of the UK Coastguard following reports of a grey dinghy in distress. 
A number of 999 calls were made to the rescue centre requesting assistance with reports that a man onboard required medical attention. 
Lifeboat crew reported there were 23 other people on the 6-foot grey rib that was caught out in rough seas. A rescue and recovery operation was launched with a helicopter seen airlifting a person to hospital.  
A spokesman for the Coastgaurd confirmed: 'HM Coastguard has been coordinating a search and rescue response to an incident off Kent, working with Border Force and other partners. We sent the coastguard helicopter from Lydd and Dover RNLI lifeboat.' 
Meanwhile, the Home Office also confirmed that 66 migrants made the perilous Channel crossing in three boats on Wednesday. French authorities stopped a further 43 in three small boats.
It comes after it was reported that Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
However, No 10 said it would not comment on conversations with specific countries over the processing of migrants who arrive in the UK. 
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'I've always been clear that we want to keep all options on the table.
'As illegal migration is an international issue, you'd expect us to have discussions with both France and other international partners to help reduce illegal migration.'
He added the UK had been in talks with a 'number of countries' but added: 'I'm simply saying I'm not going to get into speculation about ongoing discussions with individually named countries.
'As you'd expect given the international elements of this, it is right the Government speaks to a number of countries about these global challenges.'
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project could cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
Ten migrants have been found dead in an overcrowded wooden boat trying to cross the Mediterranean.
The ramshackle boat, which was packed with around 100 refugees, was found by the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) team, drifting 30 nautical miles away from the coast of Libya, where it departed. 
Dozens of survivors were rescued by the MSF team, and are now on the Geo Barents rescue vessel.
Those on board revealed there was a powerful smell of fuel in the boat and victims had spent more than 13 hours crammed in the lower deck. 
So far this year, around 1,225 migrants have died or gone missing while trying to make the perilous crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean. 
Caroline Willemen, project coordinator on the Geo Barents, described the Mediterranean as the 'deadliest migration route'.
'We are once more witnessing Europe's unwillingness to provide the much needed dedicated and proactive search and rescue capacity in the Central Mediterranean' she added.
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday.  
Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said: 'We are facing a global migration crisis and the number of people arriving on UK shores is unacceptable.
'We must work closely with our European and international partners to target the ruthless organised criminal gangs behind these deadly crossing and welcome the French Government's commitment to step up action to prevent crossings, including increased surveillance, greater intelligence sharing and deployment of frontline operations
'The New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken system, break the deadly business model of the people smugglers and prevent further loss of life.' 
Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has confirmed that the Government is looking at processing migrants who cross the Channel in small boats overseas.
He told LBC Radio: 'First of all, you're always better off dealing with the flow of migrants from a crisis or a conflict in the region itself, our overwhelming focus is on that. It's better for migrants, it's better to be resettled and relocated nearer to your home.
'But to the extent that we get this flow over to the UK, it's important to reduce the pull factor, we will work with all our partners - and it's not just one country, we've looked at the Australian experience, we've been talking with the Danes about this and we want to make sure the processing, if it's possible - and that will depend on the good will and co-operation of partners - can be done elsewhere.'
Asked if this will include Albania and Rwanda, he said: 'Let me avoid talking about individual countries but just say with international partners this is something we're probing because we want to test the idea because we will do everything we can to resolve this problem.'
Pressed if the plan will cost £100,000 per migrant, he said: 'I don't recognise that number. Until you've got a detailed agreement with a particular country, I don't think we'll be in a position to cost it.'
Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal that migrants evicted from their squalid Dunkirk camp by French police have set up a new encampment in a field next door.
Others have erected their tents in woods less than half a mile away from their demolished camp to keep alive their dream of finding a place on a boat to the UK.
The crowded camp on an area of abandoned industrial land and was home to 1,500 migrants until it was closed down by police at Grand-Synthe near Dunkirk.
Residents of the camp were given the option of being taken by coach to shelters across France in return for going through the French process for asylum seekers.
But most of them chose to continue living rough and refused to accept the offer out of fears that it would hinder their long term aim to reach the UK. 
Small groups of migrants today returned to their old camp and broke through the fences erected by police in a half-hearted bid to seal off the entrance.
MailOnline today witnessed pitiful scenes as former camp residents rummaged through stinking piles or rubbish left behind after the mass eviction. 
Migrants piled up old clothing, bedding, tents and pots and pans into supermarket trolleys which they wheeled away to their new camps.
Others chopped up pallets and other construction material from flattened makeshift shelters to get fuel for their camp fires.
Many of the migrants including families with children had only a short distance to travel to their new home in the field next door to their old camp.
They included Iraqi Kurdish mother Kazhal Rzgar, 46, and her two daughters Hadya, 22, and Hasta, seven, and her and her two sons who put up their old tent in a corner of the field.
The family have been surviving largely on food hand outs from charities since they arrived 16 days ago at the Grand-Synthe camp after landing in Italy on a migrant boat.
Channel migrants are set to be flown to ALBANIA to a new asylum centre at cost of £100,000-a-head a year as French deny agreeing to stop all crossings 
Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania, it was reported last night.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project would cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday. 
On Tuesday, around 80 migrants were pictured climbing into inflatable dinghies in northern France before they were pushed into the sea and began their journey to Britain. 
A total of 1,185 people crossed the channel last Thursday, eclipsing the previous daily high of 853. Overall this year, there have been more than 20,000 crossings.
In response to news about the plan to open an asylum centre in Albania, a Home Office spokesman said: 'Migrants making these dangerous crossings are putting their lives at risk and it is vital we do everything we can to prevent them and break the business model of the criminal gangs exploiting people.
Migrants who have been picked up after landing or intercepted at sea are taken to a Border Force processing centre, such as Tug Haven near Dover. 
Here arrivals are triaged to identify any medical needs or vulnerabilities, fed and checked to see if they have a criminal record. Adults have an initial interview before being sent to accommodation centres across Britain, paid for by UK taxpayers and provided by private contractors. 
The migrants are given £37.75 per week for essentials like food, clothes and toiletries while they wait for a decision on their asylum application. If the claim is rejected they face deportation back to their home country. 
Kent County Council normally takes unaccompanied children into its care, although other local authorities are also involved in this programme. 
'People should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and as part of our response it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the channel and work with international partners to put an end to these dangerous journeys.'
When the plans were first reported by The Sun last month, the Albanian prime minister's official spokesman branded the reports as 'absolutely untrue'.   
The news comes after it was suggested in March that asylum seekers who cross the Channel illegally to reach Britain could be sent to a third country such as Turkey. 
Other options on the table were islands off the coast of Scotland, the Isle of Man, or Gibraltar. 
At the time, charities branded the proposals 'inhumane', while an immigration expert said that whilst there was no law prohibiting such a move, there was 'bound to be a court case about it'. 
On Wednesday, new research from the British Refugee Council revealed that nearly two thirds of migrants who cross the Channel to reach the UK are originally from the Middle East.    
More than 61 per cent of those who make the dangerous journey across the 21 mile straight Calais to Dover are nationals from countries such as Iran and Iraq.
The highest number of migrants arriving in small boats are from Iran, with 3,187 Iranian nationals reaching UK shores from January last year to May this year. 
This accounts for 26 per cent of all arrivals in small boats over this period.
Figures also show 2,185 people from Iraq crossed the Channel over the same period. 
The figure makes up around 17 per cent of the 12,195 migrants who arrived in the UK in small boats in 2020 and at the start of this year.
Other Middle Eastern nationalities in the top 10 countries of people who arrived in small boats include war-torn nations such as Syria and Yemen, along with oil rich Kuwait.  
From non-Middle Eastern countries, the largest number of arrivals came from Sudan, in north-east Africa. Around eight per cent of small boat arrivals were from Vietnam, while around six per cent of people arrived from Eritrea and one per cent from Ethiopia.
All of the nations in the top 10, which make up 91 per cent of arrivals on UK shores, are countries were human rights abuses and persecution are common, according to the British Refugee Council. 
According to figures obtained by the British Refugee council, migrants arriving in the UK in small boats between January 2020 and May 2021 were from: 
Iran: 26 per cent
Iraq 17 per cent
Sudan 11 per cent
Syria: 10 per cent
Vietnam 8 per cent
Eritrea: 6 per cent
Afghanistan 5 per cent
Kuwait 5 per cent
Yemen 2 per cent
Ethiopia 1 per cent
Other: 9 per cent  

The research came after MailOnline journalists witnessed the moment that two 50ft long inflatable dinghies loaded with up to 40 migrants each leave northern France on Tuesday morning. 
At dawn. dog walkers and a jogger watched in amazement as the two separate groups, who had been hiding overnight in the sand dunes, ran to the water's edge with their giant boats.
Smuggler minders waded in to the sea as the migrants climbed aboard for the dangerous trip to Britain but they did not make the journey with them.  
Despite the ongoing crossings and the lack of progress in stopping them, Ms Patel had claimed she had agreed with French interior minister Gerald Darmanin agreed to work to prevent '100 per cent of crossings' of the Channel.   
The Home Office issued a joint statement from the pair which said they had agreed measures to 'stop the dangerous crossings' of the 'deadly route'.
But the French embassy in London said the 100% figure 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin held talks on Monday night with the UK and France involved in a long-running row over how to address the problem of migrants seeking to cross the Channel.
The 'joint statement' issued afterwards said: 'Both the Home Secretary and interior minister agreed to strengthen operational cooperation further.
'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings.
'They agreed to accelerate the delivery of the commitments made in the joint agreement of July 2021 to deliver on their joint determination to prevent 100% of crossings and make this deadly route unviable.'
But the French embassy said on Twitter: 'For the record, the 100% figure was not agreed between the Home Secretary and French interior minister @GDarmanin and should not be presented as an agreed commitment: it is not.
'And it is not part of the joint statement.'
However, in a press conference on October 9, Mr Darmanin said that with the correct resources and the support of the British authorities, 100 per cent should be able to be reached.",-2
83,"Sajid Javid has delayed plans for GPs to declare if they earn more than £150,000 a year, it emerged today. 
The Health Secretary agreed to postpone the proposals, which left doctors furious because they felt 'singled out'. 
The BMA welcomed the move saying GPs were too busy facing 'some of the most intense pressures many have ever experienced'.
Officials wanted to ensure GP pay transparency was 'in line' with other civil servants, including senior NHS managers. 
The Government's delay was revealed by Dr Richard Vautrey, the outgoing chair of the British Medical Association's GP Committee. 
He led the union's rebellion against No10's orders to force GPs to see more patients in person, following a huge row over a lack of face-to-face appointments.
The panel has already balloted its members on whether they want to take industrial action over the proposals, which would have seen the worst-performing practices 'named and shamed'.
As well as refusing to sign off Covid vaccine exemptions, the action could also see doctors refuse their contractual requirement to declare the highest earners which technically came into force this week. 
It was also revealed today that Dr Vautrey's replacement will be a doctor who wants surgeries to stop offering patients 'vital' services. 
Dr Farah Jameel, a GP in Camden, north London, was confirmed as the next chair of the committee following a vote. She beat rival candidate Dr Chandra Kanneganti, a Tory councillor and mayor for Stoke-on-Trent.  
One doctor said anyone 'daft enough to vote for a Conservative party member (after what they have done to us) to lead their union needs to resign'. 
The average annual income for a GP in Britain is £100,000.
Data showed family doctors worked 6.6 sessions a week before Covid, the equivalent of just over three days. Those days often consist of 12-plus hour shifts. 
Highly-paid doctors were due to have their name and salary band revealed under the new five-year GP contract.
Dr Farah Jameel, a GP in Camden, London, has been appointed as the new chair of the BMA's committee.
She had complained about GPs having to provide extra services before she took the role.
In an article in GPOnline in 2018 she claimed further services were 'another example of GPs' goodwill being exploited and taken advantage of'.
The article was attached with a strap that read: 'You wouldn't expect a builder to do a job on the side for free, or ask a lawyer to do some extra work without being paid for it.
'So why should it be any different for GPs?'
Non-core services include inserting pessaries, phlebotomies and spirometries. The NHS doesn't pay for these, meaning doctors don't have to offer them.
But critics say doctors should offer the services regardless and today condemned Dr Jameel's 'lax attitude'.
Department of Health bosses said it was to 'bring general practice in line with other public servants, including senior NHS managers'.
Welcoming the delay today, the BMA said it would give GPs 'breathing room' during a busy period.
'Crucially, these changes could have caused disruption over the winter period — distracting from the immediate priorities facing practices and their patients,' a spokesperson told Pulse Magazine.
'We are glad that the secretary of state is delaying these plans, providing some breathing space for hard-working GPs.’
Dr Vautrey also said it was 'good to see Sajid Javid has agreed to delay plans for GP earning declaration arrangements' in a tweet last night.
He warned that GPs were facing 'the most intense workload pressures' and added that the move would have been a 'distraction'. 
It comes after Dr Vautrey announced he would step down from his role this month in a shock resignation. 
Rumours soon began to circulate that he actually decided to jump ship after finding himself at odds with more militant members of his committee.
The BMA has already asked its 160,000 members whether they want to take industrial action but is yet to announce the result.
It was furious over Mr Javid's £250million package for GPs to get patients more face-to-face appointments.
No10 will still go ahead with plans to publish regular data on face-to-face attendances by NHS trusts, which will effectively create a league table. 
But the BMA has described the proposals as 'unfair, demoralising and indefensible', saying they would trigger a wave of resignations and retirements and 'sink the ship altogether'. 
Concerns have been raised that too few appointments are taking place face-to-face.
Official figures from last month showed four in ten appointments were still not in person, with most done over the phone or online.
But at the same time two years ago — before the pandemic — figures showed nine in ten appointments were done in person.
The Health Secretary has blamed problems accessing GPs for escalating pressures in hospitals.
Mr Javid told the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee this month: '[A] significant portion of people are turning up for emergency care when they could have actually gone to their GP.
'That is not the fault of those people at all. They have stayed away from the NHS when they were asked to, they now want to be seen and that is right.
'But part of the reason I think people are turning up in A&E perhaps when they don't need it is because they're not able to get through to their primary care services in the usual way.'

84,"Police who found the body of the ex-wife of a jailed Russian senator after breaking into her £10million home, have insisted her death is not being treated as suspicious.
Officers were flagged down on the Kensington street in London where Irina Izmestieva, 52, lived after being contacted by a worried friend on Friday night.
They had to get in through a basement window where they found Ms Izmestieva - also known as Irina Ford - dead on her sofa.
Her former husband Igor - sentenced to life in a high security Russian jail over contract killings 13 years ago - has now been informed she has died.
While police are not treating the death as suspicious, the coroner is considering opening an investigation.
Mother-of-two Ms Izmestieva, who came to the UK in around 2007 and became part of high society, was pictured at an event with Prince Harry in 2012, along with her daughters.  
Vladimir Putin had promised a leading human rights campaigner he would pardon and free Mr Izmestieva but has not as yet.
This latest development in the family has prompted calls from one exile for an investigation to be launched into her death.
A number of Russians have died in suspicious circumstances or faced attacks in Britain. 
A leading exile in London Evgeny Chichvarkin said today 'I very much hope that the UK's special services will investigate this case properly, thoroughly, and, perhaps, one day we'll learn what happened.
'In the past few years Irina Izmestieva was an active participant of a property dispute details of which I have no right to disclose.
'At another turn of this dispute she was found dead.'  
Close friend in London, Miranda Mirianishvili, 49, posted on Instagram that former filmmaker Ms Izmestieva had died 'unexpectedly'.
She said: 'She was coughing, they said, taking antibiotics, and had not felt well for a few days. Not Covid,
'They found her sleeping on the couch at their home in London.
'That is, they found her no longer alive.' 
London Ambulance Service attended, confirming to MailOnline: 'We were called at 7.11pm on November 12 to reports of an incident at a residential address in Cottesmore Gardens, W8.
'We sent an ambulance crew and two medics in cars. Sadly, a person died at the scene.' 
Izmestieva had been pictured at an event with Prince Harry in 2012, along with her daughters by the jailed ex-senator, who represented oil-rich Bashkortostan.
Mirianishvili added: 'Please pray for the newly departed Irina, a wonderful mother to her twin girls, a sister, and daughter, a heroic wife, a faithful, magnificent friend of mine.
'Few in the world are as bright, loyal, strong, and beautiful.
'Ira (Irina) was always there when she felt that she could help, without words or requests she did exactly what was needed.'
Chichvarkin - a mobile phone magnate before setting up a wine business in exile in London said Izmestyev had been close to Putin but became embroiled in murky business and politics. 
Irina Izmestiev's ex husband Igor served as a senator from Bashkortostan for five years from 2001.
He also had a long history working in the oil business, where he made his fortune.
But in 2007 he was detained by Russian Federal Security Service at Bishkek airport.
They said they suspected him of murdering the wife of one of his former business partners.
Three years later he was sentenced to life in prison.
The court heard he had organised a series of killings, including an attempt on then Bashkortostani President Murtaza Rakhimov's son.
Inside the courtroom investigators said he had ties to the mafia in Kingisepp, outside St. Petersberg.
In 2017 Putin visited Lyudmila Alexeyeva, a human rights movement, to celebrate her birthday and said he would pardon and free Izmestiev.
So far he has not been freed and has been kept behind bars under high security. 
'At the beginning of 2005 Putin presented him with a gold metronome,' he said.
But gang members testified that he had been linked to ordering 'multiple assassinations'.
Izmestyev fled to London but was lured to Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan, on the pretext of a business trip, capital of Kyrgyzstan, where he was detained in a clandestine FSB operation, and flown to Russia.
He had taken his fortune out of Russia and a dispute over this may have stopped his release from jail, it is claimed.
He had been convicted of leading a gang that committed killings soon after the collapse of the USSR.
Investigators linked him to two 'terrorist attacks' and 14 murders, and five attempted murders.
A video of him appeared from inside high-security White Swan prison in Perm region.
In 2018, the highly respected head of the Moscow Helsinki Human Rights Group, Lyudmila Alexeyeva, indicated that Putin had signalled he would pardon Izmestyev. 
A spokesman for the Met said: 'Passing police officers were flagged down at around 7pm on Friday, 12 November by a woman concerned for the welfare of an occupant at a residential address in Cottesmore Gardens W8.
'Officers gained entry through a basement window and found a woman unresponsive. LAS attended and the woman, aged in her 50s, was pronounced dead at the scene. Next of kin are aware.
'The death is not being treated as suspicious. The Coroner has been informed.'",-2
85,"Boris Johnson enjoyed a freebie worth £1,800 at an exclusive private lounge at Heathrow Airport before getting off on a free holiday at the Spanish estate of one of his ministers, it was revealed today.
The Prime Minister confirmed he enjoyed the facilities at the Windsor Suite - which gives guests their own personal butler - before he and wife Carrie jetted off to Marbella with their son Wilfred.
The facility has previously been used by VIPs including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the singer Adele.
The information was revealed in his updated entry in the MPs' register of interests, which shows he was given it free by the airport. 
However, Mr Johnson has still not registered the holiday at the Torre Tramores estate, which had a rental value of £25,000 per night, in the same register.
He has previously refused to, saying that because it is owned by Lord Goldsmith, a friend of his wife and a Foreign Office minister, he does not have to.
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: 'It is utterly ludicrous that the only donation that Boris Johnson has declared related to his latest freebie luxury holiday is the hospitality he enjoyed in the lounge waiting for his plane.
'The Prime Minister was given a gift by someone that he gave a peerage and a ministerial job to and the Prime Minister needs to tell us the truth about his donations.'
According to its website, the Windsor Suite, which is close to Terminal 5 at the west of London airport, guests can await their flight in one of eight private lounges, adding: 'Meeting you at our private suite will be one of our doormen who will escort you inside where your personal butler is waiting.'
It also boasts a food menu from Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton and offers the use of a personal shopper in the main terminal building.
He was given hospitality for three people in the lounge on October 7, the register shows. 
Downing Street has previously claimed that because the Johnsons' holiday in Spain last month was provided by a minister it falls outside the remit of the House of Commons financial probity watchdog. 
The holiday was revealed on the ministerial register of interests as having provided free of charge by Goldsmith, a former MP and friend of Carrie Johnson who was handed a peerage by Mr Johnson after losing his Commons seat in 2019.
But an entry on the separate MPs register would require revealing how much the benefit in kind was worth. 
The Torre Tramores estate, where Mr Johnson, Carrie and their son Wilfred stayed, is available for private rent at a cost of £25,000 per night for a secluded retreat with its own private helipad. 
A No 10 spokesman said the holiday provided by 'a longstanding friend' had been registered correctly.
However, the ministerial code entry says the property was provided by 'the Goldsmiths', not just the minister.  
Labour has demanded a probe into the holiday by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. 
Goldsmith is the former MP for Richmond Park who was elevated to the peerage by Mr Johnson after losing his seat to the Liberal Democrats.
The move allowed the 46-year-old to remain in Government as an environment minister. He is currently Minister for the Pacific and the Environment having been given an additional role in a 2020 reshuffle.
The stay at the Torre Tramores in early October sparked fury as Mr Johnson left the UK amid a gas price crisis that struck businesses. ",-2
86,"Vladimir Putin has accused the West of 'escalating' tensions around Ukraine by building up forces on his border, even as thousands of Russian troops, tanks and artillery pieces sit close by.
The Russian president said Europe and the US had carried out ship drills in the Black Sea and flown bombers close to the frontier - crossing 'red lines' and showing that Russia is not being taken seriously.
As he spoke, the Russian military test-fired an 'unstoppable' hypersonic Zircon missile at a target in the White Sea - saying it scored a direct hit. 
It comes after Washington accused Putin of preparing for an invasion of eastern Ukraine in order to annex territory as he did with Crimea in 2014.  
'Western partners are escalating the situation by supplying Kiev with lethal modern weapons,' Putin said, even as Ukraine's defence minister revealed he has asked Brussels and Washington for more military tech.  
He said Moscow has been 'constantly raising concerns about this' but 'all our warnings and talk about red lines are treated superficially'.  
Putin has been voicing concern about US naval exercises in the Black Sea for days, telling his French counterpart this week that they were 'provocative' and leading to 'increasing tensions' between Moscow and NATO.
He has also slammed Ukraine for using a Turkish-made drone against pro-Moscow rebels.
It came as Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said he is in the process of agreeing a 'Russian containment package' with allies in Washington and Brussels including 'increased sanctions' as well as 'supplies of additional weapons'. 
Speaking today, Mr Kuleba said: 'Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, increased considerably in recent weeks.
'Ukraine is already actively consolidating partners in countering hybrid threats.
The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels in recent days, 'work is underway to develop a comprehensive package of containment of Russia'.
Ukraine has been fighting a years-long proxy-war against Russia, which supports separatist rebels in the country's eastern regions.
It stems from the 2014 rebellion which ousted pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych and led to Russian annexing Crimea in the aftermath. 
The conflict has so-far claimed some 13,000 lives.
Crimea juts into the Black Sea and contains an important Russian naval port with easy access to the Mediterranean.  
Renewed Western speculation about Russia's plans in eastern Ukraine have come amid a clash over an unexpected migrant crisis on the border with Kremlin-aligned Belarus and EU member Poland.
The EU has accused the Kremlin-backed regime of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus of purposefully luring thousands of migrants - mostly from the Middle-East - to its doorstep as revenge for sanctions.  
Ukraine accuses Putin of masterminding the scheme directly, as part of a wider strategy to 'shatter Europe'.
NATO, the EU and US have thrown their weight behind Poland against Belarus, and on Thursday UK defence minister Ben Wallace travelled to a NATO base in Poland to speak with the country's defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak.
Mr Blaszczak subsequently announced that British engineers are being deployed to the border to help reinforce the defences.
 'The Polish border is sealed and it will be sealed. Despite hybrid attacks, we will keep Poland safe,' he said.
'I would like to thank the British for their commitment, especially in the face of situation on the Polish Belarus border. 
'Polish serve side by side with British soldiers.'
Putin used a speech to Russia's foreign ministry to call for a de-escalation of military tensions, appealing directly to the EU.  
'Brussels needs to understand that decreasing military-political tensions is not only in Russian interests, but in those of the whole of Europe, even the world,' he said.
Earlier on Thursday, the Kremlin said Europe should not blame Russia for 'all problems'.
'Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
He added that Europe should instead 'address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe'.
Peskov's remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any 'military adventurism' on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland.
'Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain,' Peskov said.
'Russia is not waging any hybrid wars,' he added.
- Ukraine seeks more Western arms -
Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion.
Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, on Thursday said it was seeking more military aid from the West.
Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border.
'Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing.
The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels 'work is under way to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia'.
He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for 'the supply of additional defence weapons for our army'.
Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering.
This week, France's Macron told Putin that Paris was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity, according to the Elysee.   ",-2
87,"Boris Johnson has refused to say whether his father Stanley will be probed by the Tories after two women made claims of inappropriate touching.
The PM said it was 'absolutely right' women feel they can make complaints with confidence.
It comes after it emerged Stanley could be fired from a prestigious role as an environmental ambassador over the sexual assault allegations.
The powerful Conservative Environment Network, of which he is international ambassador, said: 'The alleged behaviour is not acceptable.'
The 81-year-old allegedly assaulted Conservative MP Caroline Nokes who said he had smacked her 'on the backside about as hard as he could' in 2003.
Her revelation earlier this week promoted political journalist Ailbhe Rea to come out and say he 'groped me'.
But as calls grew for a probe, a supporter of the 'charming' former MEP vowed it should not be a police matter if he was 'a little over-friendly, indeed handsy'.
Asked about the claims against his father, Mr Johnson said today: 'First of all, it's absolutely right that everybody, women in particular, should be able, have the confidence, to come forward and make complaints.'
The Prime Minister added: 'I'm obviously not going to comment on individual cases.'
He also declined during a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, North Yorkshire, to say whether he has spoken to his father about the allegations.
Last night it emerged Stanley could lose his role as international ambassador of the Conservative Environment Network.
Yesterday in an excruciating exchange in the Commons, the PM found himself being grilled by MP Miss Nokes about government policy on sexual harassment.
She did not mention her own claims against his father, but asked Mr Johnson if women would have more confidence 'if public sexual harassment was a specific crime', and if early intervention might stop 'those harassing women becoming sex offenders?' 
Stanley ignored questions on the matter as he left his house in north west London yesterday.
He had previously told Sky News: 'I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all – but there you go.'
Labour has called for 'criminal authorities' to investigate the claims, which emerged on Monday when Miss Nokes named Stanley during a panel discussion on Sky News.
She said during the Tory Party conference in 2003, when she had been the Tories' candidate for Romsey, Stanley slapped her bottom and said: 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat.'
After the allegation was broadcast, political journalist Miss Rea, who writes for the New Statesman, tweeted: 'Stanley Johnson also groped me at a party at Conservative conference in 2019.'
Yesterday another political journalist, Isabel Oakeshott, tweeted a photo of herself with the PM's father.
But she wrote: 'The charming Stanley Johnson can be a little over-friendly – indeed handsy – but I don't believe this is one for the police.
'Officers should focus their limited resources on investigating real crimes.'
She was deluged with replies from Twitter users accusing her of 'excusing' sexual assault. One said: 'I don't think 'Handsy Stanley' is the defence you think it is.'
Sky News political correspondent Kate McCann tweeted: 'You might be OK with someone being handsy but other women would find that uncomfortable...
'Your tweet suggests… it's their problem if they're offended, not his for being 'over-friendly'.'
Lifelong conservationist Stanley was made international ambassador at the think-tank the Conservative Environment Network in February.
But the organisation has now distanced itself from him, saying: 'We take all allegations of inappropriate behaviour very seriously.
'We have clear internal processes for managing allegations of this nature. The alleged behaviour is not acceptable to CEN.'
The chairman of CEN is Ben Goldsmith, a family friend of the Prime Minister's wife Carrie.
Yesterday the PM was grilled about sexual harassment when he appeared before Parliament's liaison committee of senior MPs.
They included Miss Nokes in her capacity as chairman of the women and equalities committee.
Miss Nokes – two days after accusing his father of smacking her bottom – put it to the Prime Minister.
She said: 'Isn't it fair to say that if public sexual harassment was a specific crime, you might see women with more confidence to come forward?'
Mr Johnson replied: 'All women should have confidence to come forward… and there are proper procedures for those claims and complaints to be investigated.'
The MP asked: 'Should we not intervene earlier, before those harassing women become sex offenders?'
The PM said: 'We need to prosecute people more effectively for things that are already criminal.'
Earlier Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the International Trade Secretary, said if Mr Johnson Snr had touched her inappropriately, 'I'd have probably slapped him'.
She told Sky News: 'This is something women have, for far too long, had to tolerate – the casual sexism, the wandering hand.'",-2
88,"The profits of a small family furniture business in Nottingham rocketed by an astonishing 4,700 per cent after disgraced former Health Secretary Matt Hancock helped it land a £29m government contract for PPE at the height of the pandemic, MailOnline has learned.
Monarch Acoustics Ltd, owned and run by husband-and-wife team Stuart and Sophie Hopkin, was given the £28.8m contract to supply surgical gowns after being referred to the fast-track 'VIP lane' by Mr Hancock in May 2020. 
The effect on the company's finances were dramatic, according to its accounts.
Turnover leapt from £9.8m in 2019 to £38m in 2020, and pre-tax profits ballooned from just £267,000 to a hefty £12.6m over the same period.
At the end of the 2019 financial year the firm, which has only 80 employees, had just £41,000 in the bank, yet a year later that figure had grown to a cool £10.2 million.
The exclusive list of suppliers was set up by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic to fast track supplies of PPE.
It enabled ministers, MPs, Lords and top government officials to recommend firms that could help secure PPE for healthcare workers when the UK was struggling to get hold of equipment in 2020.
Firms recommended via this route were considered by the cross-government PPE team to 'be more credible or needed to be treated with more urgency', according to the National Audit Office (NAO).
The companies were not subject to the usual checks due to the urgency of the situation.
A total of 47 firms were awarded contracts worth a total of £4.7bn by the VIP lane, and companies on the list had a 10 times greater success rate of securing contracts.
Monarch Acoustics managing director Mr Hopkin, 39 and his wife are pictured on her Facebook account larking around with their three boys in a variety of fancy dress outfits including as giraffes and lions.
Mrs Hopkin, 35, also posted a photo of herself while pregnant above an NHS rainbow symbol and another with two of her children, all wearing 'All in this together' rainbow tee-shirts with the government message #Stayathome Protect your community against COVID-19' banner beneath.
Boris Johnson's government has faced accusations of cronyism after it emerged that some firms were given access to a High Priority Lane which fast-tracked their bids for personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts.
The government had refused to reveal details of the priority access scheme – but four Tory MPs and three peers have now been named as 'referrers' in a list of 47 firms that won PPE contracts through the VIP lane.
The list of lucrative PPE deals provided by the Good Law Project and published by Politico website shows that former health secretary Mr Hancock helped in the process of securing work for four separate firms, including Monarch.
Until the pandemic, Monarch – also known as Monarch Educational Furniture - does not appear to have any experience of PPE, judging from its website or Mr Hopkin's LinkedIn profile. 
He states: 'Monarch Education Furniture is a family run business with over 25 years' experience in manufacturing good quality furniture. We believe that customer service is the number one priority at all times and we strive to exceed our customers' expectations of quality, value and personal service.'
On the company website, they say: 'For over 30 years we've been carving out a unique spot in the education furniture industry, with warm customer service and fantastic lead times that you won't find anywhere else.
'In our 96,000 square foot purpose-built factory in Nottingham, we manufacture a wide range of stock units and undertake bespoke projects to meet the complex needs of the education, healthcare, and public sector markets.'
The healthcare side of the business appears to refer to the manufacture and sale of furniture used in hospitals, including, according to the website: 'furniture for nurse's stations, wards, bedside, clinic and medicine storage, waiting rooms, surgeries and IT.'
Nowhere on the website is PPE mentioned, but in the 2020 accounts lodged with Companies House, it is noted: 'During the year the company had the opportunity to diversify, due to the Covid pandemic, which involved several different contracts utilising current suppliers. This is the reason for the significant increase in turnover as shown above.'
The Hopkins, who make up two of the three directors of Monarch Acoustics, live in a large modern detached house in the middle of a leafy village about a 20-minute drive from the centre of Nottingham that they bought for £1.1million in cash without the requirement for a mortgage in March.
Mrs Hopkin, who is listed as company secretary of the firm, also ran a photography business called Sophie Marie Photography (SMP) at one stage.
An online listing on Yellowplace states: 'SMP Offers fun photo shoots, based in Nottingham. Specialising in maternity, newborn, baby and children's photography.' 
The third director of Monarch, 60-year-old Gary Frost, lives in Leicestershire, according to Companies House.
In 2016, Monarch Acoustics announced a move to 'new state-of-the-art' production facilities, opening a factory and warehouse near Nottingham airport.
But the new building was entirely devoted to educational furniture, according to a press release they issued.
'Monarch Education Furniture is a family run company that has been manufacturing furniture for schools for 30 years,' said the release.
'Our company has grown considerably over the last 10 years and in 2014 we had our busiest trading year.
'As market leaders in educational storage furniture we have developed our manufacturing techniques using state of the art machinery and innovative fixings.
'We operate a very strict quality control process in our factory and only dispatch furniture that we are proud of. We take pride in our craftsmanship and offer a high level of quality.'
Stuart Hopkin and Mr Hancock failed to respond to questions from MailOnline.
A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: 'These insinuations of wrongdoing are completely false. During a national emergency we were grateful for all efforts to get hold of PPE. All offers were treated in line with standard process. Matt had nothing to do with the awarding of this or any other PPE contract.
'When Matt was approached with this credible offer he passed it on to government officials. This was right and proper and what anyone would do in the circumstances.
'Inferring any wrongdoing is completely false. This work saved lives.'
They added the the firm's credentials were 'credible' because, 'they were already supplying the US. Due diligence was done on this and all contracts by officials.'  
A former chairman of the Conservative Party was also named among several Tories who helped almost 50 firms win PPE contracts worth millions during the lockdown.
Lord Feldman, a former tennis partner of ex-PM David Cameron, referred three businesses to ministers before they were given untendered contracts using the 'VIP fast lane'.
Mr Hancock, who quit in the summer after having a lockdown-breaching affair with an aide, referred three apart from Monarch, while the list of 47 businesses amassed by the Good Law Project also showed referrals by ex-No10 air Dominic Cummings, as well as senior ministers including Michael Gove.
The companies were able afterwards to access lucrative contracts for PPE equipment using a much-criticised system set up to speed through supply of vital material as the NHS struggled to cope.
There is no suggestion that the politicians played a role in awarding contracts to businesses they referred onwards to the procurement process.
Lord Feldman has denied any wrong-doing, insisting he was just passing 'credible offers on to officials' from Maxima Markets, SG Recruitment and Skinnydip.
They were later awarded contracts worth £65million between them. Good Law Project director Jolyon Maugham told MailOnline: 'The scale of public money that flowed into the pockets of those able to lean on Ministers for VIP lane treatment is just breathtaking.
'The VIP lane funnelled vast sums of public money into the pockets of those with Tory links.
'It also made it harder to buy the PPE the NHS needed. Civil servants were besieged by crappy suppliers with political connections - and that made it much harder to buy the right stuff.'
A government spokesperson said: 'At the height of the pandemic there was a desperate need for PPE to protect health and social care staff and the government rightly took swift and decisive action to secure it.
'Ministers were not involved in awarding contracts.'",-2
89,"During the pandemic, fewer people sought out care for pink eye due to coronavirus-inspired social distancing, increased handwashing and other health measures.
Researchers at the University of Washington analyzed both emergency department visits and Google search trends related to pink eye, comparing 2020 to previous years.
Emergency department visits decreased by 37 percent after March 2020 compared to the previous five years, while search interest decreased by 34 percent.
The study suggests that, like the flu and other infectious respiratory diseases, pink eye cases may be reduced with more social distancing, handwashing, and similar safety measures to those used for Covid.
During early months of the pandemic, many people delayed routine doctors' appointments as offices were closed and physicians focused on Covid.
At the same time, mask-wearing, social distancing, and other Covid safety measures led to fewer infections of some other common diseases.
For example, flu season during the winter of 2020 to 2021 was incredibly mild in the U.S. and other countries.
In this flu season, just 0.2 percent of flu infection tests came back positive in the U.S. - compared to up to 30 percent of tests in the last three flu seasons - according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Another common infectious disease, pink eye, also became less prevalent during the pandemic, according to a new study.
Researchers at the University of Washington evaluated this disease in a paper published Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology.
Pink eye - or acute conjunctivitis, as scientists call it - is a highly contagious disease characterized by inflammation of an outer part of the eye, leading the whites of patients' eyes to appear red.
The condition is typically caused by a bacterial or viral infection, and can be transmitted through direct contact with someone who's infected.
It can also be transmitted through surfaces, air droplets, and bad hand hygiene. Droplets carrying the infection can live on some surfaces for weeks.
The University of Washington researchers hypothesized that Covid safety measures - especially social distancing and handwashing - might lead to a case decrease in 2020.
The researchers analyzed emergency department visits at the university's medical center between 2015 and early 2021.
Through text mining, they identified a total of 1,156 emergency department visits that led to a pink eye diagnosis.
In addition, the researchers used Google search trends from 2016 to 2020 to identify how often people in the U.S. searched for information on pink eye.
Along with pink eye, the researchers looked at common eye conditions that aren't contagious for comparison.
For both the emergency visits and Google search analyses, the researchers used modeling to compare trends during the pandemic to what would have occurred if Covid hadn't shut down the country.
Far fewer people visited the emergency room for pink eye after March 2020, the researchers found.
ED visits were 37 percent lower in the rest of 2020 compared to the previous five years.
Overall, an average of 8.4 people visited the emergency room for pink eye each month after March 2020 - compared to 17.1 pink eye patients a month before the pandemic.
The researchers didn't see significant decreases in ED visits for the other, non-contagious eye conditions.
Google search data showed a similar trend: 'The search interest in conjunctivitis abruptly decreased in March 2020 and remained low throughout the year,' the researchers wrote.
Search interest was 34 percent lower after March 2020 than it had been in the previous four years.
And once again, there was no significant decrease in people looking up symptoms of other non-contagious eye conditions.
'The combination of social distancing, travel restrictions, and increased emphasis on hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic likely led to a decrease in viral transmission,' the researchers wrote.
The researchers compared Google search trends for pink eye to mobility data, finding that search interest for the condition decreased at the same time as people were staying in their homes due to Covid restrictions.
Pink eye cases decreased even during the winter and spring months, when this condition is typically causing more outbreaks.
'While we are able to show a decrease in the number of patients seeking emergency care for conjunctivitis, it is possible patients were less likely to go to the ED because of a fear of contracting Covid,' the researchers wrote.
At the same time, however, the similar trends in emergency room visits and Google searches of symptoms suggest that the decrease was, in fact, due to fewer pink eye cases.
These findings suggest that, just as safety measures used for Covid - such as mask-wearing and handwashing - can lead to fewer flu cases, these measures can lead to fewer pink eye cases. ",-2
90,"Western Europe is no longer the continent's capital for excess deaths, official data shows with Eastern European countries now taking up that mantle.
While countries like the UK, Spain, Italy and Belgium bore the brunt of fatalities early in the pandemic, the crisis has slowly shifted East, to nations like Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.
A major analysis by the Office for National Statistics looked at excess deaths — the number of fatalities from all causes above the five-year average — on the continent from the start of Covid to mid-2021.
It found that nearly every corner of Europe has suffered well above average excess deaths at some point, either due to coronavirus itself or the knock-on effects of lockdowns.  
There are a few exceptions, namely the Scandinavian nations which have kept case rates and excess deaths low, excluding anti-lockdown Sweden. 
In the UK, 120,000 more people have died than usual so far during the pandemic with a significant spike in non-Covid deaths in people's homes. It has been referred to by experts as a 'silent crisis'. 
The ONS' interactive map shows trends in excess deaths have followed the trajectory of Covid waves. Western countries were hit hardest early in the pandemic because of their close proximity to Italy, the continent's original epicentre. Most of these were Covid, even if a lack of testing in the early days did not pick up on all of them.
But there has been a shift in the first half of 2021 after wealthy EU members stocked up on vaccine supplies and squashed Covid death rates.
It is no coincidence that Eastern European nations — where uptake of the jabs remain low — made up seven of the 10 countries with the highest excess death rates by June this year. 
By the week ending June 18, Poland had the highest rates of excess deaths with 23 per cent more than the five-year average, followed by Bulgaria (21 per cent) and the Czech Republic (20 per cent).
Rounding out the worst five are Slovakia (17 per cent) and Romania (14 per cent), followed by Slovenia and Hungary (both 10 per cent). 
By contrast, the highest in Western Europe was England (7 per cent), Spain (6.5 per cent), Scotland (5 per cent), and Wales (4 per cent). The UK's rate as a whole was 6.7 per cent above average in June.
By the middle of summer 2021, eight countries in Europe had below average excess mortality — Denmark, Cyprus, Finland, Iceland, Malta, Norway, Luxembourg, and Sweden. Norway had the lowest at minus 12 per cent. 
Eastern European countries lag behind many in the West when it comes to vaccinations, which is contributing to Covid deaths and therefore excess mortality.
Just 25 per cent of Bulgarians have been fully vaccinated against Covid, figures show, compared to around 65 per cent in the UK, France and Germany. 
Romania is doing slightly better with just over 35 per cent of the population jabbed, while Slovakia has jabbed more than 40 per cent.  Uptake is above 50 per cent in Poland and the Czech Republic.
The ONS found that, in the UK, some local authorities had up to triple the number of deaths from all causes compared to average on some weeks. 
Enfield and Tower Hamlets, both boroughs in London, suffered 226 per cent and 214 per cent more deaths than usual in weeks in January, at the peak of the second Covid wave. 
Meanwhile, the ONS found that almost all countries had higher excess mortality in 2020 than in 2021, except for Portugal, Estonia and Hungary.
This is because less people are dying from Covid on the continent now that there are high levels of immunity thanks to vaccines and natural protection from previous waves.  
However, in recent weeks there has been a fresh wave of Covid infections on the continent that has sent nations back into draconian restrictions and could see excess deaths start to rise again. 
Italy is considering a lockdown of the unvaccinated, it emerged yesterday, which would make it the second country to impose the controversial intervention after Austria. 
And Germany's incoming government has said that it wants unvaccinated people to be barred from going to work and travelling on public transport amid what Angela Merkel calls 'dramatic' infection levels. The Netherlands has also introduced a 7pm curfew for pubs and restaurants amid rising cases there.
Starting tomorrow in Ireland, all hospitality businesses including nightclubs and pubs will be forced to close at midnight, the use of Covid passports will be expanded, and people will be advised to work from home where possible.
The British Government has repeatedly rejected pleas to implement its Plan B, which would see similar measures to what are being levied on Ireland. But Boris Johnson has admitted a full-blown lockdown could still be on the cards if cases spike.
The UK is in a slightly different position from many of its European neighbours in that it was the first country on the continent to come out of lockdown and drop all restrictions over summer. The move is believed to have frontloaded cases in the autumn, which scientists believe should avert a major peak in winter.   
More than 60,000 extra deaths have occurred in private homes since the start of the Covid pandemic, official data shows as experts call for an investigation into the trend.
An Office of National Statistics (ONS) report published last week found that there have been 252,486 deaths in private homes between January 2020 and June 2021.
The number of deaths at home in the England and Wales has steadily risen since 2005, with thousands more people choosing to die in the comfort of their home rather than a hospital bed. But the proportion leapt nearly 30 per cent in 2020 compared to the year before, as Britons were told to 'stay home, protect the NHS, save lives' when Covid struck. 
The ONS data shows there were about 41,000 more at-home deaths from all reasons in 2020 compared to 2019, with the number of people dying at home peaking in May. 
However, figures for 2021, which go up to June, show there were nearly 25,000 more deaths at home than the five-year-average for this period, casting doubt over lockdown being the sole reason for the rise.
While Britain was still in its third lockdown at the start of 2021, the Government toned down its 'stay home' messaging and the NHS was told to continue treating non-Covid patients. 
There has been serious debate over the merit of the lockdowns and if they did more harm than good for the nation's health with it leading to people avoiding seeking medical help out of fear of the virus and disrupted tests and scans for illnesses such as cancer. 
Experts have called for further and more detailed research to determine if people are choosing to die at home, or if they being left to suffer by a system unable to to provide them quality care of their final days. 
The biggest at-home killer was heart disease, killing more than 25,000 people in 2020 alone. Covid has only played a comparatively minor role in deaths at home, killing around 3,000.",-2
91,"Dominic Raab today refused to deny ministers want to strike a deal with Albania to send Channel migrants to a new asylum centre there - but the country immediately dismissed the proposal as campaigners warned it could actually increase crossings. 
The Deputy Prime Minister confirmed the government is looking at the idea of an overseas processing centre for migrants who travel to Britain illegally, but declined to comment on specific locations after Albania was named as the likely host. 
Olta Xhaçka, the eastern European nation's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, insisted the idea was a non-starter and described it as 'fake news'. 
The British government is under huge pressure to stem the flow of illegal crossings, which have now exceeded 20,000 this year. 
Under a scheme that first emerged today, anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days. 
Quizzed about the offshore detention proposal this morning, Mr Raab suggested it could help reduce Britain's 'pull factor'. 
Migrants who have been picked up after landing or intercepted at sea are taken to a Border Force processing centre, such as Tug Haven near Dover. 
Here arrivals are triaged to identify any medical needs or vulnerabilities, fed and checked to see if they have a criminal record. Adults have an initial interview before being sent to accommodation centres across Britain, paid for by UK taxpayers and provided by private contractors. 
The migrants are given £37.75 per week for essentials like food, clothes and toiletries while they wait for a decision on their asylum application. If the claim is rejected they face deportation back to their home country. 
Kent County Council normally takes unaccompanied children into its care, although other local authorities are also involved in this programme. 
He told LBC Radio: 'First of all, you're always better off dealing with the flow of migrants from a crisis or a conflict in the region itself, our overwhelming focus is on that. It's better for migrants, it's better to be resettled and relocated nearer to your home.
'But to the extent that we get this flow over to the UK, it's important to reduce the pull factor, we will work with all our partners - and it's not just one country, we've looked at the Australian experience, we've been talking with the Danes about this and we want to make sure the processing, if it's possible - and that will depend on the good will and co-operation of partners - can be done elsewhere.'
Asked if this will include Albania and Rwanda, which have both been named in press reports, the Deputy Prime Minister said: 'Let me avoid talking about individual countries but just say with international partners this is something we're probing because we want to test the idea because we will do everything we can to resolve this problem.'
And pressed if the plan will cost £100,000 per migrant, he said: 'I don't recognise that number. Until you've got a detailed agreement with a particular country, I don't think we'll be in a position to cost it.'  
Meanwhile, immigration campaigners have claimed offshore detention is both cruel and ineffective. 
Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said: 'In Australia, offshore detention was a $15.8 billion disaster that actually encouraged traffickers to overwhelm the system with more boat arrivals. 
'The only outcome of the policy was the harm done to the refugees locked away in slum-like camps, where a lack of monitoring led to hundreds of cases of child abuse and sexual assault.'  
Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: 'We know from the Australian model that offshore detention leads to appalling outcomes including high levels of self-harm and mental illness.
'It comes at huge cost to the tax payer and is likely to be wholly ineffective in deterring people from crossing the Channel.
According to figures obtained by the British Refugee council, migrants arriving in the UK in small boats between January 2020 and May 2021 were from: 
Iran: 26 per cent
Iraq 17 per cent
Sudan 11 per cent
Syria: 10 per cent
Vietnam 8 per cent
Eritrea: 6 per cent
Afghanistan 5 per cent
Kuwait 5 per cent
Yemen 2 per cent
Ethiopia 1 per cent
Other: 9 per cent  

'The Government need to urgently change their approach, and focus on developing more safe routes for people to travel to the UK to claim asylum such as a Humanitarian Visa system'
Today Home Office officials confirmed that 'around 1,000' more migrants were detained by Border Force on Tuesday as the migrant crisis in the Channel continued, sparking concerns of another record breaking day.
A lifeboat was scrambled to rescue 23 people from a boat in the Channel today, as it was revealed that around 1,000 more migrants were detained on Tuesday. 
Official figures are yet to be released but it is feared that Tuesday's total could rival the 1,185 record reached last Thursday as the migrant crisis reaches breaking point. The figures have taken some two days to calculate due to the sheer number of arrivals.
The previous daily high was 853 and, overall this year, there have been more than 20,000 crossings. 
This morning, an RNLI Dover lifeboat was launched just after 5.30am at the request of the UK Coastguard following reports of a grey dinghy in distress. 
A number of 999 calls were made to the rescue centre requesting assistance with reports that a man onboard required medical attention. 
Lifeboat crew reported there were 23 other people on the 6-foot grey rib that was caught out in rough seas. A rescue and recovery operation was launched with a helicopter seen airlifting a person to hospital.  
A spokesman for the Coastgaurd confirmed: 'HM Coastguard has been coordinating a search and rescue response to an incident off Kent, working with Border Force and other partners. We sent the coastguard helicopter from Lydd and Dover RNLI lifeboat.' 
Meanwhile, the Home Office also confirmed that 66 migrants made the perilous Channel crossing in three boats on Wednesday. French authorities stopped a further 43 in three small boats. ",-2
92,"Migrants evicted from their squalid Dunkirk camp by French police have set up a new encampment in a field next door, MailOnline can reveal.
Others have erected their tents in woods less than half a mile away from their demolished camp to keep alive their dream of finding a place on a boat to the UK.
The crowded camp on an area of abandoned industrial land and was home to 1,500 migrants until it was closed down by police at Grand-Synthe near Dunkirk.
Residents of the camp were given the option of being taken by coach to shelters across France in return for going through the French process for asylum seekers.
But most of them chose to continue living rough and refused to accept the offer out of fears that it would hinder their long term aim to reach the UK. 
Small groups of migrants today returned to their old camp and broke through the fences erected by police in a half-hearted bid to seal off the entrance.
MailOnline today witnessed pitiful scenes as former camp residents rummaged through stinking piles or rubbish left behind after the mass eviction. 
Migrants piled up old clothing, bedding, tents and pots and pans into supermarket trolleys which they wheeled away to their new camps.
Others chopped up pallets and other construction material from flattened makeshift shelters to get fuel for their camp fires.
Many of the migrants including families with children had only a short distance to travel to their new home in the field next door to their old camp.
They included Iraqi Kurdish mother Kazhal Rzgar, 46, and her two daughters Hadya, 22, and Hasta, seven, and her and her two sons who put up their old tent in a corner of the field.
The family have been surviving largely on food hand outs from charities since they arrived 16 days ago at the Grand-Synthe camp after landing in Italy on a migrant boat.
Her son Mubin, 16, said: 'We are staying here because we want to come to England. We think England is so nice. You can get a job, go to school and have good weather.'
Mubin admitted that his family had paid 'so much money' to people smugglers to reach Europe, but he refused to say how much.
His family left his father behind five-months-ago in Darbandikhan in the Kurdish administered area of Iraq so they could head to the UK and make new lives.
Mubin said: 'It is hard living here in the cold and rain with no toilets and no money. But when I get to England, I want to go to school and then get a job as a barber.
'France is good, but my mum doesn't like France. The language is so hard. English is easier and we have family in Birmingham as well.'
He said that his family faced borrowing at least 2,500 euros each to get a place on a boat across the English Channel.
Mubin added: 'It is so dangerous on the boats, but we have to go.'
  Hadya, a former art student at a Kurdish university, said: 'In Iraq we have no money and no life. People are not good. Life is good in England. You have a home and everything is good.
'When I get there, I want to be an artist or an actor in a film'.
Accounting student Harem, 28, who has also set up his tent in the field, said: 'We want to go to England, of course, but I don't know how. You have to pay for a boat, but I don't have any money.'
He admitted that life was intolerable in the old camp, saying: 'We lived here like monkeys. The police just turned up and told everyone to leave. They destroyed my food and they took my everything.'
Harem said he had saved up for eight years working as a building labourer to pay for his passage from the Kurdish capital Irbil in Iraq.
He flew to Dubai and then on to Belarus before he got over the border to Poland and then caught a train to Germany as part of a travel package he purchased in Kurdistan.
But he said that the 1,050 euros that he had were stolen by corrupt Polish border guards in return for them letting him into the country.
He confirmed he was an economic migrant, saying he wanted to leave for the UK because he was 'unable to get a proper job' at home.
Iranian migrant Mohammed, 19, said he was among around 100 people who had defied the police by spending last night back in their old camp.
He said: 'This was a horrible place to live because of all the rubbish. Everyone was always hungry. But I am going to live in one of the new camps now.'
Police and local council officials have so far made no effort to clear up the piles of rubbish left at the old camp.
The abandoned debris includes scores of trollies taken from the Auchan superstore opposite the camp as well as broken up tents mixed up with rubbish including used nappies, blankets, sleeping bags, odd shoes, mattresses, bottles, cans and other food containers.
Most of the debris was piled in heaps around the open tarmac area where migrants had setup their hundreds of pop up tents.
Other shelters were left inside one of the old warehouse buildings on the site.
The camp which had been dubbed the 'New Jungle' in reference to the notorious Jungle camp in Calais which closed in 2017 was closed after trebling in size in recent weeks.
Officers with riot shields faced little opposition as they entered the camp which is believed to have been managed by gangs of people traffickers.
The closure was ordered French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin after he
spoke with British counterpart Priti Patel about migrant crossings in the Channel.
But his office insisted on Tuesday that the clearance was not a direct result of the call between the politicians, and had been pre-planned.",-2
93,"Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of Princess Charlene after her husband revealed she's left Monaco, despite only just returning from a 10-month absence, and hinted that she's struggling with her mental health. 
Speaking to Monaco-Matin yesterday, Prince Albert, 63, confirmed his wife, 43, who has appeared increasingly frail, has left the principality and is staying at a secret location while she 'recovers from tiredness', away from him and their six-year-old twins. 
'She is better but she still needs rest and peace,' he said in an article translated from French. 'She is not in the Principality but we will be able to visit her very soon.
'I cannot tell you more out of discretion. There is tiredness, not just physical, which can only be treated with a period of rest and monitoring.' 
He added their children, Jacques and Gabriella, had 'suffered from the absence of their mother' but that he had compensated by stepping up to take a more active role in their lives. 
'For me, it's pretty simple – my priority is my family,' the prince said, when asked about juggling the role of being a head of state and a father.  
He continued: 'This is an extremely important time in [the children's] life – the way they grow up helps them see the world.
'And if one of the parents is away for medical reasons, the other parent has to be there. I have heard too many friends and acquaintances telling me that they wish they had been there for their children, at a certain age, taken up by their work or their professional life. I don't want to have these regrets.' 
Asked if the children had been 'more protected' during their mother's absence, Albert added: 'They should be protected in general, but of course they suffered from the absence of their mother. But they had enough distractions and a family circle that made sure they were not lacking in affection.'
The prince also said rumours around the state of his marriage 'don't bother him too much'.
It comes after the House of Grimaldi confirmed Charlene will not attend Monaco's National Day celebrations - one of the biggest events in the royal calendar - on Friday.
Charlene, 43, returned to her husband and twins Jacques and Gabriella in Monaco last Monday following a 10-month absence while she recovered from surgery following a sinus infection she contracted during a solo charity trip to her native South Africa earlier this year.
In the days after her arrival, Charlene's sister-in-law Chantell Wittstock, told MailOnline the princess may not be returning to the palace and did not plan to immediately return to public engagements, although she later retracted the remark.
Before she left in January, Charlene had raised eyebrows in Monaco by living in a modest two-bedroom apartment above an old chocolate factory about 300m away, rather than in the 12th Century Palace itself. It is thought she could return to living at the property. 
Asked whether the Princess would now return to the arm's-length arrangement the couple had before her departure, Ms Wittstock, married to Charlene's brother Sean, who is on the board of her charitable foundation, said: 'Oh, we don't know yet. She'll probably be commuting between the two, wherever she's comfortable.
'And none of that is clear yet where she'll be settling or anything like that. I mean, she only just arrived back, so it's everybody finding their feet. The Princess is very excited to see her kids and they're very excited to see their mom again.
'So we'll see where she'll be settling. But it will be with her husband and her children.
Ms Wittstock, asked about media stories focusing on the state of her sister-in-law's marriage to Prince Albert, added: 'It is absolutely not something I can comment on. But what I can say is the princess is back in Monaco with her husband and children that should say it all.' 
She later retracted her statement, claiming that Charlene would be staying with her husband and children, but the latest comments from Prince Albert prove otherwise. 
Meanwhile, Prince Albert has continued to carry out royal duties on his own.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the couple said: 'The Princess is currently convalescing and will continue to do so for the coming weeks, allowing Her time to recover from a state of profound general fatigue.'
The statement said the couple have 'both decided that a period of calm and rest is necessary to ensure the very best recovery for Princess Charlene's health.'   
It continued: 'In order to protect the comfort and privacy essential to Her recovery, the Princess' location will remain strictly confidential.
'As soon as her health permits, the Princess looks forward to once again carrying out her Princely duties and spending time with the Monegasques.'    
The claims will inevitably cast a shadow of doubt over the staged photocall last week when Charlene was reunited with Albert, 63, and their children after a 10-month absence from Monaco. 
Charlene spent months without her family in her native South Africa while she recovered from surgery following a sinus infection she contracted during a solo charity trip earlier this year.
The reunion, shared on Instagram, was eyed with scepticism by French commentators amid feverish speculation about the state of the Grimaldis' marriage.
Charlene's time away followed fresh allegations last December that Albert had fathered a love-child (which would be his third, if proven) with an unnamed Brazilian woman during the time when he and Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer for South Africa, were already in a relationship.
On the question of Charlene's return to public engagements, she sounded equally equivocal, saying: 'She absolutely will - if everything goes well, if she is definitely still healing and recovering.
'That doesn't just happen overnight. She's definitely going to be taking it easy. And yeah, her main focus right now will be spending time with her children and her family.

'All we can say right now is all of her procedures in South Africa were a success. So medically the doctors have cleared her to fly back. And that's why she's obviously back in Monaco with her kids.' 
She said the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, which promotes water safety and wildlife conservation in Africa, would soon expand to cover the whole continent.
'The main reason for coming to Africa in the first place was to launch more Foundation projects, which is when she fell ill and the Foundation team in South Africa absolutely carried on with all of those, making sure that everything happened exactly the way she wanted it.
'Even during recovery, in between procedures, the princess still tried to be completely hands-on and on the ground and work with us. 
The foundation will also be expanding into the whole of Africa as of next year.
'As far as Charlene goes. The outlook is is positive and you know she's going to get back to full strength and be full steam ahead. It's not going to happen overnight.'
The new development will certainly add fuel to the intense speculation over the future of the marriage of Charlene and Albert.
Monday's photos were greeted with a hefty dose of scepticism by the French media.
Albert was waiting for her at the Monte Carlo helipad, along with their six-year-old twins, Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques. The family were joined by a hand-picked photographer inside the Palace walls for the 'reunion' photos.
But there was already doubt cast over the couple's living arrangements.
'Reunion of Albert and Charlene of Monaco: but where exactly do they sleep?' was the headline question in the respected French celebrity outlet Gala on Tuesday.
And Voici – another popular magazine read widely across Monaco and France – ran with: 'Charlene of Monaco back: the Princess breaks the silence and forgets to mention her husband'.
This was a reference to Charlene using a social media video to thank everybody who had helped her through months of ill-health, without name-checking Albert at all.
In the streets in the shadow of the 12th century Prince's Palace, people could not conceal their concern for Charlene this week, having seen the photos of her looking so obviously frail.
'We are glad to have her back, but she doesn't look well and it feels we don't yet have the full picture,' said one cafe owner on the Rock, in his 50s, who asked not to be named.
He admitted that in years past, he like many Monegasques, had expressed frustration at the way Charlene has been less visible than other royals.
'There was a while when there was a sense that she was a reluctant princess,' he said, 'but this is different - there's obviously something not quite right either with her or the marriage and for whatever reason we're not being told what.'
There certainly appears to be a wall of silence around Charlene, especially since she retreated behind the ramparts of the Palace, at least for the time being.
Her Palace press officer said she could not return calls from MailOnline and did not reply to a list of questions we sent her.
Doubts about the central relationship of Monaco's royal family are not new of course.
Several residents living in the narrow medieval alleys of Monaco Ville confirmed to MailOnline that before she left for South Africa Charlene was spending most of her time outside the Palace at the Chocolate factory apartment.
'We often saw her outside the Palace and she would usually be alone or with a bodyguard,' said one source, 'but she was never with Albert - it was obvious she chose to spend most of her time in the apartment rather than the palace.'
Another Monte Carlo source who knows the couple well told MailOnline: 'The way to stop all the friction and put an end to the speculation about their marriage is for Charlene to proudly move back into the Palace and start living like a proper Princess.
'That's what the people of Monaco want, because they love their Royals, and don't want them living separate lives.'
Charlene came in for criticism before she travelled to South Africa for dividing her time between several properties outside the Palais, the official residence of the Sovereign, Albert II.
Instead of enjoying palatial rooms overlooking the Mediterranean, and a domestic staff including butlers and cooks, Charlene chose the Chocolate Factory.
It only had two bedrooms, and had been used in the past by Albert's sister, Princess Stéphanie.
Stéphanie, 56, led an extremely turbulent personal life herself that included two divorces and high-profile affairs with security guards and an elephant trainer.

2005 - In May, a former flight attendant claims that her youngest son, whom she named Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, was Prince Albert's child. She states that his parentage had been proven by DNA tests requested by the Monegasque government.
On 6 July, a few days before he was enthroned on 12 July, the Prince officially confirms via his lawyer Lacoste that Alexandre was his biological son.
2006 - After a DNA test confirmed the child's parentage, Albert admitted, via statement from his lawyer, that he is Jazmin Grace's father.
2010 - Princess Charlene and Prince Albert announce their engagement
2011 - Princess Charlene was said to have bolted two days before the royal wedding after hearing Prince Albert had a third love child during their relationship. It was alleged that Charlene tried to flee home to South Africa three times before her 'arranged marriage', at one point taking refuge inside her country's embassy in Paris.
Monaco officials were said to have coaxed her back by brokering a deal between the Prince and his reluctant bride that she provide him with a legitimate heir. After that she would be free to leave of her own free will.
During the wedding, Charlene was in floods of tears, while her husband looked on impassively. Later in the year, Princess Charlene confessed she felt 'very lonely' in Monaco
2012 - Princess Charlene was reported to be 'depressed' at her failure to provide her husband with a legitimate heir.
2014 - Pregnancy was announced in May. In December Charlene gave birth to twins Princess Gabriella and heir to the throne Prince Jacques.
2017 - Princess Charlene visits Africa, tells media: 'I am African and this is my heritage. It will always be. It's in my heart and in my veins.'
2019 - In a rare interview, Princess Charlene confessed it is 'sometimes hard to smile' and said the year had been 'very painful'In another interview, she said she found motherhood 'exhausting'
2020 - Charlene debuts a shocking half-shaved hairstyle. It is announced Prince Albert of Monaco will appear in court in the new year to fight explosive claims he fathered a third love child with a secret girlfriend before marrying his now wife Princess Charlene.
2021 - January 27 - Charlene is pictured with Albert for the Sainte Devote Ceremony in Monaco. It is the last time she has been seen in Monaco this year.
Charlene also escaped Royal protocol by staying at Roc Agel, a mountain retreat on the outskirts of Monaco originally restored for Albert's late mother, the Hollywood star Grace Kelly who became Princess Grace before her tragic death in a car crash on the treacherously steep road approaching Roc Agel.
Charlene was also a frequent visitor to a holiday home owned by friends on the Mediterranean island of Corsica.
Paris Match, the celeb bible, has always had particularly close ties with the Grimaldis – the ancient dynasty now headed by Albert and Charlene.
'Charlene and Albert on the Verge of Breaking Up?' was the lead headline in an edition of Match in August.
'There will be no photo for their 10th anniversary wedding anniversary,' it noted.
All the high-end French publications – the kind that Albert and Charlene would normally grant fawning interviews to – concurred.
The upmarket and very conservative Madame Figaro ran with the stark headline: 'Are Charlene and Albert II of Monaco on the verge of divorce?'
Historian and author Philippe Delorme told the magazine: 'Lots of people got the impression it was an arranged marriage, it's true.
'Albert chose a wife who resembled his mother and Charlene clearly felt very ill at ease in this Grace Kelly role they wanted her to play.
'As Karl Marx put it: History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.'
The 2011 wedding itself was an ostentatious three-day event featuring a concert by the Eagles. But onlookers were concerned by photos of the bride in tears with her husband appearing distant, but Charlene insisted later she was just emotional.
Charlene has been notable by her absence from every single flagship event in the tax haven principality this year.
They have included the Monaco Grand Prix on May 23, and the Fashion Awards hosted by the Princess's own charitable foundation on May 18.
Charlene infamously shaved half her head in the style of a punk rocker last December.
This was seen as the first public sign of a worsening crisis that could end in a multi-million pound divorce.
Charlene's exile in South Africa began a month after it emerged last December that Albert was facing yet another paternity suit.
A Brazilian woman who cannot be named for legal reasons said her 15-year-old daughter was the result of an affair with Albert in 2004.
Albert and Charlene were not yet engaged at this time, but they had known each over for four years after meeting at a swimming gala in Monaco in 2000.
Lawyers for the claimant were scheduled to demand a DNA test from Albert at a court in Milan earlier this year, while his own counsel branded the action 'a hoax'.
Neither party is now commenting, suggesting some kind of generous settlement may have been reached, as happened with Albert's earlier love children.
They are Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, who is now 29 and the result of Albert's affair with an American estate agent, and Alexandre Coste, 17, whose mother is a former Togolese air hostess.
Both children were struck off Monaco's line of succession in return for vast financial settlements.",-2
94,"Matt Hancock's job advert for a new member of staff at his House of Commons office has sparked a series of mocking memes about his tryst with his former aide.
The ex-health secretary's post looking for a communications officer was ridiculed on social media in wake of his affair with Gina Coladangelo.
Many made reference to the couple while some asked if they needed to be experienced in CCTV - in reference to him being caught out by his own office security camera in June.
Mr Hancock called for applicants to help run his social media accounts and do public relations for the embattled MP.
The ad said the successful candidate will be 'highly organised' and have 'sound judgement'.
But social media users mercilessly mocked the disgraced minister by clogging up his tweet with references to his affair with Ms Coladangelo.
He lost his job when it emerged they were seeing each other despite her being his £15,000-a-year aide and them breaking social distancing rules at the time.
His Twitter post had read: 'I'm hiring in my brilliant Parliamentary team. Take a look here.'
The job ad said: 'Matt Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, is looking to recruit a Communications Officer who will be primarily focused on communications activity.
'The successful applicant will need to be able to undertake media and press activities, design and create content for social media, as well as assist with wider communications activities and assist the wider parliamentary and constituency team.
'The role will be based in the Westminster office.' It said the salary was in line with IPSA pay scales.
But the advert trigger a torrent of mockery, with most pointing towards his affair with his aide.
One posted the CCTV picture of him kissing Ms Coladangelo with the caption: 'Only former female university friends need apply.'
Another put: 'Do I need a working knowledge of CCTV?' One person wrote online: 'Well, not much public service, based on Matty-boy's previous history. But plenty of grift, for sure.'
Another man wrote: 'Will there be any specific training on how to conduct an extramarital affair?'
And one more added: 'Missing a spine is requested or will [you] develop that during my probation? Not very good at lying though sure you can offer training on that too.'
The bombshell expose of Mr Hancock's affair with his aide, who was married to Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress, forced him to resign as health secretary.
Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo are reportedly still seeing each other but are rarely spotted together.
Earlier this year the former minister's crowdfunder page for his London marathon run was also inundated with mocking comments.",-2
95,"The Liverpool suicide attacker who officials suspect converted to Christianity to aid his asylum application was in a mosque 'all day, every day' at the time he began building his bomb to blow up a maternity hospital, it emerged today.
Emad Al Swealmeen, who was baptised and confirmed at the city's Anglican cathedral in 2017, was seen worshipping during Ramadan and praying with a Muslim friend in the week before Sunday's attack, it is alleged. 
The revelation will further fuel suspicion that his conversion to Christianity four years ago was just an act to persuade the Home Office to grant him British citizenship and prevent them deporting him because he had found Jesus. 
Immigration sources said today that Al Swealmeen used a false identity and multiple appeals to 'frustrate' attempts to remove him from the UK before he tried to kill women and babies on Remembrance Sunday. 
Police believe Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months and began buying components online for his suicide vest after he began renting a flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, in April, which he then turned into a bomb factory.
Investigators are said to have admitted that the device would have caused 'damage, death and destruction' on a massive scale, but they were 'lucky' when the unstable device's detonator went off and killed him as he was 'jostled' when the taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.   
Police are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown.
But a security source told the Telegraph: 'Methodology wise this attack is entirely jihadist, but we have an open mind as to what precisely was motivating him. If he built a much more destructive device then the detonation looks accidental. It looks lucky'.
The Church of England was today accused of aiding asylum seekers to 'game' the immigration system by helping hundreds to convert from Islam and 'pray to stay' in the UK as it emerged people smugglers are using Instagram to urge migrants to follow Jesus to help them gain British citizenship. 
Emad Al Swealmeen lost his first bid to stay in Britain in 2014 but appealed again in 2017 after he worshipped at Liverpool Cathedral and his case was still outstanding when he blew himself up in a taxi on Sunday.
He was baptised and confirmed having apparently spoken 'endlessly and passionately about Jesus', but members of the city's largest Anglican church admitted they 'lost contact' with him within months of the ceremony. He was one of around 200 asylum seekers to adopt the faith there over a four-year period.
A clergyman at Liverpool Cathedral previously raised concerns about asylum seekers cynically posing as Christians to boost their chances of being awarded refugee status. Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian admitted in 2016 that 'plenty of people' were lying about their intentions after it emerged that the Church of England had christened hundreds of asylum seekers under a scheme dubbed 'pray to stay'. 
He said: 'There are many people abusing the system... I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault? And who are they deceiving? The Home Office, me as a pastor, or God?'  
MPs are to demand a ­formal Parliamentary probe into whether fake Christian converts are duping the Church of England to avoid being deported back to strict Muslim countries they came from. 
It came as new statistics revealed that between January 2020 and June this year, 29% of all migrants arriving by boat say they are from Iran and 20% say they are from Iraq. 91% of all migrants came from just 10 countries - including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and Yemen. These are also nations named in the top 20 countries where Christians are the most persecuted for following Jesus. 
Priti Patel said last night that Al Swealmeen, who changed his name to Enzo Almeni shortly after finding Jesus, exploited the UK's asylum 'merry-go-round' while a Home Office source said changing from Islam to Christianity is now 'standard practice' among asylum seekers 'to game the asylum system'. 
Pledging to overhaul the asylum system, Home Secretary Miss Patel declared: 'The case in Liverpool was a complete reflection of how dysfunctional, how broken, the system has been in the past, and why I want to bring changes forward. It's a complete merry-go-round and it's been exploited by a whole professional legal services industry which has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day in day out on legal aid at the expense of the taxpayers.'
The newspaper quoted the insider as claiming that the failed asylum seeker, who somehow remained in the UK for seven years, attended the mosque 'all day every day' during Ramadan - and was seen worshipping the week before the suicide attack. 
It also emerged that Al Swealmeen adopted a fake identity, Enzo Almeni, and made repeated asylum appeals and applications, including one in January.
The terrorist has been accused of trying to 'game' Britain's creaking immigration by finding Jesus after his first asylum application failed in November 2014 when the Home Office rejected his claims that he was from Syria saying they believed he was from Jordan. 
Adding to the picture that he was lying to the authorities, following his death his family abroad said that he was actually from Iraq. 
Al Swealmeen launched an appeal within the First Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber which was dismissed on April 16, 2015.
Later that year appeals to both that court and to the Upper Tier Tribunal were also refused.
It is understood that Al Swealmeen made a fresh asylum application to the Home Office in 2017 under his new name, but this was rejected two years later.
The 32-year-old then made a new application to the First Tier Tribunal on January 19 this year which was under review at the time he blew himself.  
Yesterday police found several 'suspicious packages' after raiding a pub and asylum hostel linked to the Poppy Day suicide bomber.
Officers said Emad Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months but have not found any evidence that he conspired with or was inspired by a terror group.  
A Royal Logistics Corp bomb disposal vehicle was seen arriving in Sutcliffe Street, Liverpool along with a fire engine, and the cordon was slightly extended to Boaler Street before ending this evening. 
Residents who had been told to leave their homes have now been warned that they may see explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) officers on Thursday in case further 'suspicious' items are found.
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said several suspicious packages were found, and were examined by EOD officers before being recovered by forensic teams. 
Searches have also been carried out at a property in Rutland Avenue that had been rented by Al Swealmeen since April, and that is the main focus of the police investigation. 
Police earlier said Iraq-born Al Swealmeen had rented a property in Liverpool seven months ago and had started making 'relevant purchases' for his homemade bomb 'at least' since that time. 
Officers are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown. 
One theory is that the bomber was suffering a mental health crisis having been devastated at his continued failure to gain asylum here because the Home Office refused to believe he was Syrian.  
In an update on the investigation ACC Jackson said that the pizza chef who converted from Islam to Christianity began renting his flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool at around Easter. 
ACC Jackson said: 'A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time'.
He added: 'At this time we are not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others'.  
Confirming the terrorist's cause of death he said: 'The post mortem on the deceased has taken place and the cause of death has been described as injuries sustained from the fire and explosion.' 
He also said that the 32-year-old asylum seeker had suffered from periods of mental illness that will 'form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand'.
Mr Jackson added: 'There is much comment in the media about Al Swealmeen and it is clear that he was known to many people. We continue to appeal for people who knew him, especially those who associated with him this year as we try and piece together the events leading up to this incident and the reasons for it'. 
The number of failed asylum seekers being deported from the UK fell to a record low of under 8,000 last year - down almost 40,000-a-year in eight years, MailOnline can reveal today.
Official Home Office figures show that tens of thousands of failed asylum seekers are still waiting to be sent back to the country of their birth - and cases are taking longer to complete because of the number of appeals.
In 2013 around 47,000 failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals were deported. This dropped to a low of 8,000 last year, with covid, in part, being blamed for the record low last year. 
UK Border figures from June show that there are currently 125,000 asylum cases outstanding in Britain. 
Of these 5,900 people, including Almeni until his death, were awaiting the outcome of an appeal. Some have been waiting for years.
Approximately 39,500 people are still waiting to be deported. 
There have between 19,000 and 35,000 new asylum applications a year for the past 17 years. In that period the number of applications rejected has dropped from 74% in 2004 to 46% in 2019. But this jumped back to 70% in 2020.
Around three-quarters of applicants refused asylum at initial decision lodged an appeal and almost one third of those appeals were allowed. 
There are calls for the Home Office to review their policies and practices in the wake of the attack after it emerged suicide bomber Enzo Almeni, 32, had been in the UK for seven years without gaining permanent residency.   

His 1lb bomb went off as his taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital just before the 11am national silence on Remembrance Sunday. 
There have been conflicting reports about what the device was made of. 
Some insiders claimed it was packed with ball bearings and made using homemade TATP explosives. TATP is unstable and known as a 'Mother of Satan' because it is liable to blow up accidentally. It was used by Islamist terrorist in the Paris suicide attacks of 2015, the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017 and the failed Parsons Green Underground station. 
But other experts believe he may have bought his explosives online or on the high street and may have even constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
Detectives are now trying to trace Al Swealmeen's movements to discover whether he bought his explosives online or on the high street. Experts now fear the bomber constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
A former counter-terror official told The Telegraph: 'The white smoke that can be seen billowing out of the cab could indicate the use of gunpowder and there is also a flash within the cab itself which could be powder burning.
'It is possible to construct homemade devices using fireworks, but it still requires a degree of expertise and planning.'
There are suspicions that he might have followed a recipe for the material used by the 7/7 bombers who targeted London in 2005. 
Worryingly, no one who knew him raised the alarm about his behaviour. His local mental health trust said he had previously been receiving help, but was no longer a patient. 
A Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We can confirm Emad Al Swealmeen had previously accessed our services but was not a service user at the time of the incident.'
Friends said Al Swealmeen had wrestled with depression and was sectioned in 2014 after he was rejected for asylum for the first time. 
They recalled how the bomber was so 'car mad' that he nicknamed himself 'GT' and had the initials tattooed on his arm along with a chequered flag. 
He changed his name to Enzo Almeni – after the Ferrari boss – and loved go-karting so much that that he bought his own helmet and got friends to sign it.
He was a regular at the TeamSport Go-karting track, on Liverpool's Brunswick docks, often going with his housemates or on his own to race laps.
Friends said they were astounded that the 'quiet and bashful' young man, who was also a big fan of country singer Johnny Cash, was behind the Poppy Day bomb.
One, who knew Al Swealmeen through his job at a pizza takeaway, said: 'He called himself GT because he loved cars, it was a little nickname he gave himself, he even had it tattooed on his arm.
'He was quiet, but not in a weird way, he was just really shy. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw his picture. Of all the people that worked in the takeaway he would have been bottom of my list to do something so sick.
'He was reserved, but not like he was hiding something, more like he was lacking in confidence. He did speak to me about feeling depressed one time, but didn't really go into it. At the time he lived in a shared house with a few others and all he cared about was go-karting.
'He showed me his helmet that he had bought, he was really excited about it. He went go-karting a few times on his own, he was so into it, and I remember him getting a tattoo and showing it off.
'He also loved Johnny Cash and he told me he wanted to get a Johnny Cash tattoo too.'
Malcolm Hitchcott, 77, a lay pastor and retired Army officer who gave Al Swealmeen a room in his home for eight months in 2017, remembered accompanying him on a trip to the track.
Pictures on social media show him in racing overalls at the karting venue, where he took part in 'Top Gun' marathon karting races and '50-lap' events. 'He got me to sign his helmet, rather like Lewis Hamilton signs helmets [for fans],' 
Mr Hitchcott added: 'He never spoke about a particular driver but he loved Ferrari, he was a Ferrari man. His email address was Ferrari-related too. He was very interested in motor racing.'
The indoor facility boasts 40mph karts and several of Liverpool's sporting greats such as Jamie Carragher, Sam Quek and Tony Bellew on its celebrity leaderboard.
But a source said Al Swealmeen had not been to the track for over a year. Last night the businessman who employed Al Swealmeen at his pizza takeaway for several months in around 2016 said he was a 'nice, polite guy'.
'I was shocked when I saw who it was,' the man, who did not want to be named, said.
'I still can't believe it. He was a nice, polite guy. He wasn't a practising Muslim, he told me he lived with a Christian family, and he definitely wasn't a fanatic.
'I've employed Muslims before, some of them don't like touching ham if it isn't Halal, but he didn't seem worried about that.
'He worked part-time for me, he had a visa and was legit. I paid him about £50 a day.
'Never in a million years would I think him capable of something like that.'
The friend agreed Al Swealmeen was not religious.
'He never really talked about religion,' he added. 
'I didn't think he practised any faith, although I do remember him telling me one time he had been to church and was trying to get to know people there.
'I would love to know what happened to him over the past few years. He must have been manipulated or corrupted. The man I knew and what he did on Sunday – they are like night and day.'",-2
96,"Almost one in five Brits are not planning normal Christmas and New Year's celebrations amid lingering fears over the coronavirus crisis, according to a new poll. 
An exclusive survey conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for MailOnline found the majority of people - 81 per cent - do intend to go ahead with normal celebrations but 19 per cent said they do not. 
Meanwhile, the nation is split on whether the Government could impose new coronavirus rules which would disrupt festive gatherings. 
Some 48 per cent of people expect there will not be any coronavirus restrictions preventing normal Christmas gatherings this year. 
But almost a third - 31 per cent - expect that there will be such restrictions put in place while 20 per cent said they did not know.    
The poll findings come after Boris Johnson said earlier this week that he could not rule out a lockdown over the Christmas period. 
The Prime Minister said that while the data did not show, at the moment, that any additional measures were needed, he could not give a guarantee for the coming weeks and months.  
Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: 'Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to – non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions – get the boosters.'  
The PM warned there were 'storm clouds' gathering over parts of Europe with a 'new wave' of the virus sweeping across the continent. 
'We don't yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent,' he said.
'Those countries with lower vaccination rates have tended to see bigger surges in infection and in turn been forced to respond with harsher measures while those countries with higher vaccination rates have so far fared better.
'It shows us that if we want to control the epidemic here in the UK and if we want to avoid restrictions on our daily lives we must all get vaccinated as soon as we are eligible.'
The Government announced on Monday that adults aged over 40 will be invited to receive booster jabs in the coming weeks.
Mr Johnson added: 'It would be an utter tragedy if, after everything we have been through, people who had done the right thing by getting double vaccinated ended up becoming seriously ill or even losing their lives because they allowed their immunity to wane.'",-2
97,"Energy prices have replaced Covid as the main worry for almost half of British families, an exclusive new poll reveals today.
Some 49 per cent of voters polled say that the recent surge in gas and electricity bills is more of a concern that the pandemic, as the cold of winter approaches.
A third (33 per cent) surveyed by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for MailOnline admitted that they were keeping the heating turned off in cold weather in an attempt to lower their bills. 
Four-in-10 said they were turning the heating down, with the same amount saying they were wearing more clothes indoors instead.
And also a third (30 per cent) said they were cutting down on other spending as they keep an eye on their outgoings. 
It comes the day after it was claimed the average British family is more than £1,000-a-year worse off due to soaring inflation.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rose sharply from 3.1 per cent in September to 4.2 per cent last month, which is the highest level since December 2011.  
The bigger-than-expected rise in the cost of living comes amid surging gas and electricity prices, with regulator Ofgem last month increasing the energy price cap by 12 per cent. But the figures also show sharp fuel costs rises and inflation building across food, household goods and hospitality as supply chain disruption takes its toll. 
With households spending an average of £508.50 a week on all areas in the financial year ending 2020 according to the ONS, Labour said this new CPI rate has seen the outlay go up by £21 a week, £93 a month or £1,111 a year.
The Party added that the Office for Budget Responsibility said last month that it expected CPI inflation to average 4 per cent next year, a figure which would leave the average household spending £1,058 more a year.
Experts said today when inflation is combined with the effects of recent tax changes such as the new social care levy and personal allowance freeze, such big price increases will have a major impact on living standards.
Interest rates look set to rise before Christmas after last month's bigger-than-expected leap in the cost of living.
This has fuelled expectations that policymakers will act next month to cool rampant inflation.
Most economists are forecasting that rates will rise to 0.25 per cent in December from their all-time low of 0.1 per cent as pressure mounts on the Bank of England to rein in inflation.
A mounting cost of living crisis in the UK has seen prices rise across the board - for energy, fuel, food, cars, furniture and eating out.
Inflation has reached levels not seen for nearly a decade in the UK as the global economy reopens and amid mounting supply chain disruption.
The Bank warned earlier this month it may have to increase rates in the ""coming months"" as it forecast inflation peaking at 5 per cent next April. 
It held off from an increase at the November meeting to assess how the jobs market was holding up after the end of furlough.
Robust jobs data on Tuesday showed another 160,000 workers were added to UK payrolls in October and no large uptick in redundancies, despite furlough coming to a close on September 30.
This, coupled with inflation coming in at a higher than forecast 4.2 per cent for October, is widely expected to see the Bank raise rates at its next meeting on December 16.",-2
98,"Multiple federal agencies are looking into 15 vials - including five alarmingly labeled as 'smallpox' - that were discovered at a pharmaceutical lab outside of Philadelphia Tuesday night.
The vials, 10 of which were labeled 'vaccinia' after the virus used to make smallpox vaccines, were discovered by a lab worker who was cleaning out a freezer, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 with a successful mass vaccination campaign after it killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone.
Samples of the deadly virus are only supposed to be kept in two labs: the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Russia. 
The FBI and CDC are now investigating Tuesday's discovery.
The two agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. 
The finding was first reported by Yahoo News, which obtained a copy of an alert sent to the Department of Homeland Security labeled 'For Official Use Only.' 
It is not known how the vials ended up at the Merck facility in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania or if they really do contain the virus.
Smallpox is a serious, life-threatening illness causes by variola virus.
A person may not look or feel sick for 7 to 14 days after exposure, but initial symptoms include high fever, headaches, backaches, and vomiting.
Around a third of people who contract the disease, die. 
After the initial symptoms, a body-wide rash appears. The person is most contagious during this stage.
Rashes develop in the tongue, mouth and throat. They then spread to the face and arms, torso and legs.
Pus-filled bumps, also called pustules, form and begin to scab over and fall off over a period of about 10 days.
It was mostly spread by prolonged face-to-face due to respiratory particles. The virus was also spread by sharing sheets, towels and clothing.     
Source: Cleveland Clinic 
After they were discovered, the vials were secured immediately and the facility was put on a lockdown that was lifted by Wednesday night.
'Merck is in the process of figuring out why it was there,' the source told NBC10 on Wednesday 
Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com.
'There is no indication that anyone has been exposed to the small number of frozen vials,' a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo. 
'The frozen vials labeled 'Smallpox' were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker while cleaning out a freezer in a facility that conducts vaccine research in Pennsylvania.'
The discovery took place at the Merck Upper Gwynedd facility in North Wales, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, according to WCAU. 
'CDC, its Administration partners, and law enforcement are investigating the matter, and the vials' contents appear intact. The laboratory worker who discovered the vials was wearing gloves and a face mask. We will provide further details as they are available,' the spokesperson said. 
The incident is likely to renew questions about what should be done with the world's Smallpox samples, which are kept in only two labs in the world. 
Smallpox is an infection caused by the variola virus. Patients develop a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash, according to the CDC.  
Most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, meaning an outbreak could have devastating consequences.  
The vaccine leaves a dime-sized lesion that gradually forms a scab and leaves a scar, the CDC says. The lesion is contagious before the scab forms, and those who receive it have to protect the vaccination site from other parts of their body and other people.
In 2014, a government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland - just outside of Washington, DC - found six decades-old glass vials containing freeze-dried smallpox, according to the Washington Post.
The samples were packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box. At the time, it was the first such discovery in the country. 
In 2019, an explosion at the state-owned Russian lab holding some of the samples sent one worker to the hospital, though the World Health Organization said the blast didn't occur near the stockpiles, according to NPR.  
Earlier this month, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said the US and UK should invest 'tens of billions' in virus research, including how to possibly prevent smallpox attacks from being unleashed in places like airports, according to Yahoo News. 
'So along with the climate message and the ongoing fight against diseases of the poor, pandemic preparedness is something I'll be talking about a lot,' he said in an interview with British health policy official Jeremy Hunt.
The origin of smallpox is unknown, but the earliest written description of a similar virus appeared in China in the 4th century.
It has typically worked in outbreaks and was brought to North America by European settlers in the 17th century.
About a third of infected patients died. Those who survived were sometimes left with various scars or even blind.
The 'basis for vaccination' began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had gotten cowpox were also protected from smallpox, according to the CDC.
In the 1800s, the virus used to make the smallpox vaccine changed from cowpox to vaccinia virus. (Five of the fifteen vials found in Philadelphia on Tuesday were labeled 'vaccinia.')
Before the vaccine, variolation was a common method of protection against the virus. People who had never had smallpox took material from pustules of infected people and scratched it into their arm or inhaled it through their nose to develop immunity. 
In 1948, the virus was infecting about 50 million people a year throughout the globe, according to the WHO. 
Experts estimate that the virus killed about 300 million people in the 20th century.
Soviet scientist Viktor Zhdanov proposed a four-year global vaccination campaign starting in 1959, and the campaign got a global boost aided by US funds in 1966 and 1967, with the Intensified Eradication Program.
'Laboratories in many countries where smallpox occurred regularly were able to produce more, higher-quality freeze-dried vaccine,' the CDC notes. 
'Other factors that played an important role in the success of the intensified efforts included the development of the bifurcated needle, the establishment of a case surveillance system, and mass vaccination campaigns.'
The last known naturally occurring case happened in 1977 in Somalia. The last natural US outbreak was in 1949. 
By 1980, the WHO declared the disease wiped out.
At this point, most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, according to Yahoo News.

100,"Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo misrepresented and manipulated the number of nursing home residents who have died across the Empire State due to COVID-19, according to a State Assemblyman who sits on the committee that is reviewing its  still-secret report.
Assemblyman Phil Steck is one of the Judiciary Committee members who reviewed the nearly 45-page report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, on Thursday and Friday, prior to its release to the public.
The report could be made public as soon as next week.
The report itself is said to cover everything from Cuomo's sexual harassment accusations to claims of his staff assisting in the writing of his book on the Coronavirus pandemic.
A lesser-known part of the report includes the Cuomo administration's misrepresentation of COVID-19 data related to the death toll of nursing home residents across the Empire State and manipulating numbers as presented to the public. 
The gaps in the state's COVID-19 fatality accounting included the decision to exclude nursing home death totals of thousands of residents who died after being taken from the homes to the hospital, according to reports in August.
That report came at the same time Cuomo resigned from office in disgrace, likely to avoid an impeachment trial in the wake of a separate investigation, led by two independent investigators hired by the state's attorney general, that found he sexually harassed 11 women in office.
The report's investigators included details that the state Department of Health had specifically requested that data on hospital deaths in relation to the state's nursing home COVID-19 death toll.  
'The investigation showed that as they were considering these matters, the book deal was going on, there's a chapter in the book about nursing homes,' said the lawmaker, a Democrat who represents part of the Albany area in Upstate New York. 
'They were trying to make it as what they thought was least damaging to the governor instead of just telling the truth.'
Assembly Member Mary Beth Walsh, a Republican, said that the timing of Cuomo's abrupt resignation hindered investigative efforts to interview witnesses regarding the misrepresentation and manipulation of the nursing home COVID data.  
'I believe that the timing of the governor's resignation really kind of truncated the investigation and the ability to investigate on that,' said Walsh, whose district includes parts of Saratoga and Schenectady counties. 
'Several individuals who were scheduled to be subpoenaed did not cooperate after the governor’s resignation.'
However, administration officials in Cuomo's office did acknowledge the state's nursing home fatality totals were not complete at the time, arguing the time it would take to verify the immense amount of data.
Meanwhile, health officials said the exclusion of data was not done to make the state's Coronavirus death count look better than it was, nor was it done in an effort to protect Cuomo's reputation.  
On Friday, Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesperson, said that the former administration has yet to see a copy of the Assembly's report, while hinting the results may be 'one-sided.' 
'The Assembly Judiciary Committee has chosen not to review their findings with us which is their prerogative, but it may once again result in a one-sided report,' Azzopardi said.  
Assembly Member Walsh claimed the report included 'overwhelming evidence' that the former governor sexually harassed the women who came forward. 
Cuomo, who is currently facing a criminal charge that he groped a female aide, has steadfastly denied touching anyone inappropriately since news of the accusations initially broke.
The report also touches on Cuomo's $5.1 million book deal, rules of which Steck says were 'very clear,' adding that the then-governor violated conditions set by the state ethics committee which barred Cuomo from using his staff to help write the book. 
The ethics committee rescinded their approval of Cuomo's book deal this week, an act Walsh says could 'open the door' to further fines for the disgraced former governor.",-2

102,"As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
A SAGE adviser has moved to reassure Britons the UK will not see a spike in Covid-19 cases like Austria and Germany - but warned Europe's soaring infection rate and lockdown riots should act as a 'warning' as he urged people to get their booster jabs.  
Professor John Edmunds said today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 
'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmunds told Sky. 
This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections.
Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.
But Mr Edmunds said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position'.
This comes amid a fresh wave of Covid infections on the continent that has sent nations back into draconian restrictions and could see excess deaths start to rise again.
Italy is considering a lockdown of the unvaccinated, it emerged yesterday, which would make it the latest country to impose the controversial intervention after Austria announced lockdown would return on Monday.
And Germany's incoming government has said that it wants unvaccinated people to be barred from going to work and travelling on public transport amid what Angela Merkel calls 'dramatic' infection levels. The Netherlands has also introduced a 7pm curfew for pubs and restaurants amid rising cases there.
Both Austria and the Czech Republic have announced the return of lockdowns from Monday, with Germany poised to follow suit after health officials warned they cannot rule out a full shutdown. 
Meanwhile, Slovakia intends to bring in harsher restrictions if its current lockdown of unvaccinated people does not curb the rise in cases. 
The reintroduction of restrictions across Europe have sparked a fierce backlash and fevered protests broke out in cities including Rotterdam overnight, where riot police fired warning shots - injuring protestors marching against the Covid measures.
Today, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Vienna with the far-right opposition Freedom Party among those who have called for the protest and vowed to combat the new restrictions.
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy. 
The British Government has repeatedly rejected pleas to implement its Plan B, which would see similar measures to what are being levied on Ireland. But Boris Johnson has admitted a full-blown lockdown could still be on the cards if cases spike. 
The United Kingdom on Saturday recorded 40,941 daily COVID-19 cases, a decrease of seven percent on last week's cases, government data showed.
The figures also showed 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test - versus 157 seven days earlier - bringing the country's total deaths to 143,866. 
On a day of heightened tension across the continent; 
He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on.
'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane.
'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.'
Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmunds told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step.
'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.'
Last week the WHO warned the continent was now the epicentre of the pandemic and said the surge in infection was 'alarming'.
Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans Kluge predicted 500,000 more deaths could be recorded on the continent by March unless urgent action is taken. 
He said: 'Covid-19 has become once again the number one cause of mortality in our region.'
Dr Kluge said mandatory vaccination measures should be seen as a 'last resort', adding: 'Before that there are other means like the Covid pass.
He said this is 'not a restriction of liberty, rather it is a tool to keep our individual freedom', according to the BBC.
It comes as ten thousand people are expected to protest against Covid-19 restrictions in Vienna today after the Austrian government announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the rapidly rising coronavirus infections in the country.
Meanwhile, at least two people were shot and five others injured in Rotterdam last night as Dutch riot police opened fire on protesters as anti-lockdown demonstrations turned into an 'orgy of violence'.
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. 
The violent scenes came amid a rising anger at coronavirus measures across Europe, with Austria introducing a full lockdown from Monday, and German ministers not ruling out following its neighbour's lockdown lead. 
Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Austria on Friday became the first EU country to announce it would make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory and will next week impose a partial lockdown in the face of spiralling infections.
The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance.
Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said.
Schools will remain open, although parents have been asked to keep their children at home if possible. Working from home is also recommended.
Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. 
Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so.
But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people.
The Dutch government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 — that would exclude people who test negative. 
Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired.
'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she said. 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.' 
 Late on Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Organisers of a planned protest Saturday in Amsterdam against the coronavirus measures said they had canceled the event after Friday's violence.   
A musical protest called by DJs in the southern city of Breda against current Covid-19 measures, which include the 8pm closure of bars, restaurants and clubs, will go ahead. Organisers say they expect several thousand people. 
The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, Britain's daily Covid cases rose by another 10 per cent yesterday and deaths ticked upwards — but hospitalisations plunged 17 per cent.
Government dashboard data showed 44,242 positive tests were registered in the last 24 hours yesterday, a slight uptick from 40,375 last Friday.
Infections trended upwards every day since November 11 except for one blip, with data suggesting cases are now rising in children following the return of schools from half-term.
Another 157 Covid deaths were also announced by health chiefs, in an eight per cent rise from the same time the previous week. Latest hospitalisation figures showed 827 admissions were recorded on November 15, which was down 17 per cent. 
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. 
But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He urged people to get their booster vaccines and warned of Europe's spiralling crisis, which saw Austria become the first country to impose another lockdown.
Prof Edmunds yesterday told BBC Radio 4's the World at One programme: 'I think there's a risk because of waning immunity in older individuals - and that's all adults, not just the elderly - that cases could really take off.
'It's really important that we boost immunity in older individuals and then we might be able to avoid any significant fourth wave.
'We're going to have high levels of infection for many months, so I think the NHS will unfortunately be under significant strain. It may not get to breaking point, where we were close to before, but significant strain for a very long period of time is certainly on the cards.'
As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
Violence today broke out in Vienna after 10,000 protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against a new Covid-19 lockdown and mandatory vaccinations. 
It comes after two people were shot and six others injured in Rotterdam last night after activists clashed with Dutch riot police in a demonstration condemned as an 'orgy of violence'. 
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. 
Last week, the World Health Organisation warned Europe was the epicentre of the pandemic and said the rise in cases was 'alarming', nudging governments to reimpose measures ahead of the Christmas period.  
As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them.
Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein.
Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' said another.  
Police were pictured arrested two protesters but have not yet confirmed how many people have been detained at the Vienna demonstration. 
Last night, thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered in one of Rotterdam's main shopping streets last night, one week after the government imposed a partial shutdown.     
Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. 
Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not say if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired.
The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. 
The Dutch government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 — that would exclude people who test negative.   
The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirror much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.  

Austria on Friday became the first EU country to announce it would make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory and will next week impose a partial lockdown in the face of spiralling infections.
The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance.

Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate.
The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. 
Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so.
But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people.

Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government said yesterday would be rolled out on February 1.   
Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity.  
Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. 
The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days.  
Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. 
People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. 
Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 
'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference.
'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.'
Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus.
'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he said on public broadcaster ORF. 
Meanwhile organisers of a planned protest Saturday in Amsterdam against the coronavirus measures said they had canceled the event after Friday's violence. 
A musical protest called by DJs in the southern city of Breda against current Covid-19 measures, which include the 8 pm closure of bars, restaurants and clubs, will go ahead. 
Organisers say they expect several thousand people to attend.  
Coronavirus infection rates in the Czech Republic have hit a new record for the second time this week, the Health Ministry said.
It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday.
The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days.
In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry said, with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April.
The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average.
Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels.
Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths.
 

Footage from the Rotterdam violence showed burnt out police cars and rioters throwing fireworks and rocks at police, while photos in Dutch media showed at least one police car ablaze and another with a bicycle smashed through the windshield.
Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond said the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. 
One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. 
Cops also said it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. 
Officers arrested dozens of protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras.  
Late on Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. 
Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers.
'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said, adding that several officers were injured in the violence.
Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired.
'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she said. 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.' 
Police said that riot police later launched charges at the demonstrators, adding: 'The water launcher has been deployed.' 
The situation had largely calmed late on Friday but the smoking wreckage of a burned-out police car and dozens of smashed bicycles littered the scene, an AFP reporter said.
Riot police carrying shields and batons were directing groups of people away from the area. Officers on horseback and in police vans patrolled the streets.
Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent said.
'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. 
A SAGE adviser has moved to reassure Britons the UK will not see a spike in Covid-19 cases like Austria and Germany - but warned Europe's lockdown riots should act as a 'warning' and urged people to get their booster jabs.

Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'.
'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said.  
Dutch police said units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam.
'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement said.  
At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. 
Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. 
Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation.
Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station.  
The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection.
The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 
'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' said the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.' 
Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it said. 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' 
Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday.
The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. 
The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm.
People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. 
Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has said it will review the situation on December 3.
It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. 
The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. 
Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government said Friday. 
The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria said on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. 
Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  
The German states of Bavaria and Saxony on Friday cancelled all their Christmas markets and unveiled drastic curbs on public life as the country scrambles to contain soaring coronavirus infections.
'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, said as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants.
The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers.
Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well.
But he said tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters.
Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. 
Reporting by AFP 
Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' 
The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days.
Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO said. 
A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said, warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. 
Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament.  
Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference.  
Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar.
'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts said in a note.
'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' 
As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. 
The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations -  also has next to no Covid restrictions in place.
It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29.
And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory.
On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus.
But this move has now been reversed after critics said it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. 
Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain.
All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated.
When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries.
All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. 
Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated.
Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter.  
Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available.
Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets.
The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. 
Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets.
In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns.
Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. 
While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts say they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas.
A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however.
'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn said, urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 
'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not say. I can only say it's up to us,' he added.
The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval.
In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. 
Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening.
It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days.
Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has said animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. 
EMA said it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be.
The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness.
'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' said Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.
'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.'  
Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms.
The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data.
By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday.
Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). 
And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150).
But critics say Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed.
Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. 
But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs.
Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe.
The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus.
On Friday, the EU drug regulator said it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. 
Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots.
With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics.",-2
103,"This is the moment a desperate NHS worker urged shameless members of Insulate Britain's eco-mob to stop blocking a road so he could 'get home' to his child as the hated group continued to block roads in the capital.
In the clip obtained by LBC, the animated male can be seen pleading with the eco-zealots to move out of the road on Vauxhall, London, telling them their method of protest was 'not right'.
As his tone becomes more exasperated while he watches police officers stand idly to the side, the man repeats: 'Don't block the road! I need to get home to my child. 
'I need to get home, please. You have to think about people as well.
It comes as hundreds of Insulate Britain activists forced Lambeth Bridge and Vauxhall Bridge, London to close as they protested against the jail terms given to their road-blocking comrades. The supporters claim the nine jailed activists are 'political prisoners' and 'will not be the last to be locked up.'
The hated eco-group marched throughout the city on Saturday afternoon, blocking roads and causing chaos for thousands of commuters in the capital while chanting: 'What do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now.' 
At around 5pm, the Metroplitan Police announced that they had barred protestors from Lambeth Bridge under the terms of the Public Order Act, and urged those in attendance to 'leave the bridge' on Twitter.
They added: 'Lambeth Bridge remains shut as does Vauxhall Bridge southbound and some of Vauxhall Cross. We are working to get the roads re-opened ASAP.' 
Pictures showed members of the eco-mob being forcibly dragged away by police officers, while others returned to their usual road-blocking ways with signs that read: 'Betrayed by my government'. 
Nine members of the group were jailed this week and will spend Christmas behind bars for breaching an injunction designed to prevent the road blockades which brought the country to a standstill for weeks on end.
Emma Smart, 44 - who will be housed in Europe's largest women's prison which is home to murderers and child rapists - was handed a four-month sentence alongside Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Tim Speers, 36, and James Thomas, 47, for taking part in a protest on the M25 on October 8. 
Ana Heyatawin, 58, and Louis McKechnie, 20, were sent to prison for three months, while Ben Taylor, 27, was jailed for six months after boasting he would immediately block the roads again if not imprisoned. 
On Saturday afternoon, campaigners blocked off Lambeth Bridge with a sit-down demonstration which quickly saw police divert traffic to other routes. 
Insulate Britain has said it intends to continue its hated protests, which have sparked anger among motorists and others affected by the blockades, until the Government agrees to insulate homes.
The High Court has so far issued five injunctions to prevent protesters from blocking roads.
TfL was granted a civil banning order aimed at preventing protesters from obstructing traffic on some of the capital's busiest roads. 
Gabriella Ditton, 27, an animator from Norwich, said she has been arrested six times with Insulate Britain, including once for breaking the injunction. She said: 'I expect to go to prison at some point for at least six months because I am not going to be apologetic about this.
'I have known for a couple of years that the only thing that is going to serve us is civil resistance. I have faith in people coming together. Solutions to this crisis exist, we just need the political will to do it.' 
A campaigner, who would only give her name as Gully, told some 200 supporters who gathered outside London's Royal Courts of Justice: 'Make no mistake, these are political prisoners and they will not be the last.'
Insulate Britain began a wave of protests in September and has blocked the M25, roads in London including around Parliament, and across Birmingham, Manchester, and the Port of Dover in Kent.
In a warning directed towards the heavy police presence around the event, Gully said: 'These streets are ours and we will put one foot in front of the other, and dare you to stop us.'
She added: 'You can jail the resistor but not the resistance.'
The group, watched closely by uniformed officers, then set off for a protest walk around nearby central London streets towards Westminster chanting 'power to the people'.
Cheers rang out during the walk as a campaigner told the crowd, 'good people have a duty to disobey bad laws'.
Extinction Rebellion activist Alanna Byrne, who took part in the protest, said: 'When I saw the Highway Nine give their testimonies in court this week, I knew I had a duty to take a stand today in their place.
'These people willingly gave up their freedom to push the Government to act on the greatest crisis we'll ever face.
'The failure of Cop26 should shock everyone into action. World leaders are protecting the interests of the fossil fuel industry over the general public - they are not coming to save us.
'All we have left now is to come together on the street and rebel for all we hold dear.
'The Government thinks that this injunction will scare people into submission and stop taking action. But the opposite is true.
'This has only ignited a fire in people that will spread faster than they know. As Emma Smart said in the courtroom on Wednesday: 'I will not be a bystander.' And neither should you.'
Zoe Cohen said she had travelled from her home in Warrington in the north-west of England to take part in the demonstration out of frustration and anger.
She said: 'I am angry, distraught and grieving for the huge amount of nature that we have already lost.'
The 51-year-old said that 'ordinary people should not have to do this and risk prison'.
Ms Cohen added: 'Any disruption is microscopic to the suffering of millions of people who are dying now across the world due to this crisis.'
Insulate Britain said it was not involved with setting up the event, which was described by those who took part as community-led.
The nine protesters were sentenced at the High Court on Wednesday after they admitted breaching an injunction by taking part in a blockade at junction 25 of the M25 during the morning rush-hour on October 8.
Ana Heyatawin, 58, and Louis McKechnie, 20, were jailed for three months while Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Emma Smart, 44, Tim Speers, 36, and James Thomas, 47, received four-month sentences.
Ben Taylor, 37, was given a longer sentence of six months 'to deter (him) from committing further breaches' after his submissions to the court on Tuesday were described by Dame Victoria Sharp as 'inflammatory' and a 'call to arms'.
The judge, sitting with Mr Justice Chamberlain, said there was no alternative to custodial sentences given that the group's actions were so serious and they had made it clear they intended to further flout court orders.
Insulate Britain has said it intends to continue the protests until the Government agrees to insulate homes.
The High Court has so far issued five injunctions to prevent protesters from blocking roads.
They include four injunctions granted to National Highways, banning demonstrations on the M25, around the Port of Dover and on major roads around London, and one to Transport for London (TfL).
TfL was granted a civil banning order aimed at preventing protesters from obstructing traffic on some of the capital's busiest roads.
Those who breach the injunctions could be found in contempt of court and face a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.
Further High Court committal proceedings are expected to be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters relating to protests on October 27.

104,"Kyle Rittenhouse, who was found not guilty on all charges Friday in a controversial trial that has divided the nation, may possibly have a defamation case against President Joe Biden over reference to 'white supremacists' in a video, experts said. 
The video was posted in a September 2020 tweet, which could now possibly cause Biden legal trouble, according to lawyer Todd McMurtry, who helped Nicolas Sandmann sue news outlets for upward of $800 million for defamation. The now-19-year-old famously settled with CNN and The Washington Post after they deemed him a racist when he was seen in viral video footage wearing a MAGA hat.
Biden, 79, tweeted on September 30, 2020: 'There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States [Donald Trump] refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night.' 
Although Trump was not asked specifically about Rittenhouse's actions on the debate stage at the time, the 18-year-old was featured in the tweeted video holding a rifle in the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020.
'What you take from this tweet is that Kyle Rittenhouse was using his rifle and engaging in white supremacist misconduct, so it's actionable,' McMurtry told Fox News on Friday after Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges against him.
The lawyer admitted the 18-year-old was 'not necessarily going to win' but it is 'actionable.' 
Civil rights lawyer Leo Terrell warned Biden on Fox News that the now-president couldn't justify his remarks and that he's 'going to have to pay for and justify' his actions. 
Biden released a statement following the verdict Friday, saying: 'While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken.' 
The president also said he knew 'we're not going to heal our country's wounds overnight' but he remains 'committed' to doing 'everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally.' 
Vice President Kamala Harris also told reporters that the 'verdict speaks for itself.'
‘It’s clear, there’s still a lot more work to do,' she said before boarding Air Force One in Columbus, Ohio.  
McMurtry also argues that Sandmann and Rittenhouse have similar cases: both were minors when the event occurred and were private figures at the time. 
Although household names now, without being public figures or celebrities beforehand, Rittenhouse and Sandmann only have to prove Biden's negligence, instead of a higher burden of proof actual malice, the lawyer said.
Sandmann has also encouraged Rittenhouse to sue media outlets for defamation as well. 
'The parallels between me and Rittenhouse are impossible not to draw,' Sandmann wrote in an op-ed for DailyMail.com. 'The attacks on Kyle came from the national news media, just as they came for me.
'So every single label on Kyle as a 'terrorist', 'white supremacist', and 'school shooter' in the streets of Kenosha, will only ever be withdrawn after the damage has been done.
'So, if Kyle is prepared to take on another burden in his early life, with the acceptance that it might result in nothing, I answer, give it a shot and hold the media accountable,' he wrote for DailyMail.com. 
Sandmann sued CNN after it covered the viral moment of him staring down a Native American playing traditional music on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial while the teen wore a MAGA hat.   
He also won a lawsuit against the Washington Post in June 2020 for an undisclosed amount.  
Sandmann told Sean Hannity on Fox News Channel that he is still currently suing six media outlets and the proceedings are ongoing.  
McMurtry thinks Rittenhouse may have a case against MSNBC.  
'I think Rittenhouse may be able to do the same thing when commentators on MSNBC say he's a school shooter, a white supremacist, even a vigilante.
'Lots of media people said he was a murderer, and I think that's actionable because that suggests that he committed a crime, and we now know that he didn't. When you just throw this stuff out there, you take risks.' 
Rittenhouse's mother Wendy also spoke to Hannity shortly after her son cried on the stand. 
When asked about Biden referring to son as a white supremacist, she said: 'When I saw that, I was in shock, I was angry. President Biden doesn't know my son.' 
She later claimed that Biden 'did it for the votes' and that he 'defamed' her son.  
She also admitted her son 'had nightmares from this' and has 'a lot of healing to do.'   
Rittenhouse was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on August 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 
Rittenhouse will also appear on Fox Monday to talk with Tucker Carlson and it was revealed that Fox Nation filmed a documentary during his trial that will air in December.  ",-2
105,"A federal judge has blamed the former president for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot, saying that Donald Trump 'created the conditions' for the unrest with his 'lies.'
Judge Amit Mehta, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, indirectly invoked the president's name Friday when sentencing John Lolos to 14 days in jail for his role in the deadly demonstration.
'The fact remains that he and others were called to Washington, DC, by an elected official, prompted to walk to the Capitol by an elected official,' Mehta said.
'People like Mr. Lolos were told lies, were told falsehoods, were told the election was stolen when it was not,' Mehta added, calling Lolos a 'pawn,' according to CNN.  
Mehta appears to be the first judge to hold Trump responsible in a Capitol riot case. 
Judge Mehta, 50, was born in India and attended Georgetown University and the University of Virginia Law School. He was appointed by former President Barack Obama in July 2014 and confirmed by the US Senate via voice vote in December. 
'Once you hear people who should know better tell you that an election was stolen and they say it loudly enough, frequently enough, it's not surprising that people will believe it,' the judge said, according to Politico.
Nearly 700 people have been charged in the riot, Insider reports, and 40 have been sentenced. 
Lolos was sentenced to 14 days in jail and was ordered to pay $500 in restitution.
Prosecutors say that Lolo was seen in a video leaving the Capitol doorway waving a red 'Trump 2020 Keep America Great' flag hooked together with the United States flag, yelling, 'We did it, yeah!' after an unknown individual yelled, 'We stopped the vote!'
He was arrested after a DC airport officer saw a video of Lolos at the riot on his Instagram feed and noticed him at the airport wearing the same shirt.
At the time, Lolos was waiting for another flight out of DC because he was kicked off the first one after 'continuously yelling ""Trump 2020!""' while the plane was on the tarmac, according to Lolo's charging document.
On Wednesday, a judge sentenced Jacob Chansley, also known as the 'QAnon Shaman,' to nearly three-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the riot, with credit for the 10 months he's already served.
'I admit to the world, I was wrong. I have no excuses. My behavior was indefensible,' he said.
Chansley insisted that he is not a violent man, a domestic terrorist or a 'white supremacist.'
As part of an impassioned 30-minute speech to the court, Chansley quoted Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Jesus, and the prison break film The Shawshank Redemption.
January 6 rioters were hoping to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results in favor of President Joe Biden after President Trump repeatedly said the election had been stolen from him, a claim he continues to make today.
Earlier that day, Trump had given a speech in which he told his supporters, 'If you don’t fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'
The riot resulted in the deaths of five people, including Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer trying to stop a crowd from breaking into the building. 
'Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos who were told those lies took it to heart. And they are the ones paying the consequences,' Judge Mehta said. 
'Those who created the conditions that lead to Mr. Lolos' conduct have in no meaningful measure been held accountable.'
He told Lolos: 'You were a pawn. You were a pawn in the game played by people who know better.'
Various reports of Friday's hearing describe Lolos as 'rambling' or going into an 'extended rant.'
As his defense attorney tried to stop him from talking, he continued to cite debunked election fraud claims, claimed the evidence against him was tainted, and encouraged people listening in on the hearing to look up a video of him online, according to CNN. 
'I may have failed to explain why incarceration is necessary here, but I think Mr. Lolos just summed it up,' prosecutors said.",-2
106,"All flights to and from the Spanish island of La Palma have been cancelled due to ash from the Cumbre Vieja volcano, which has been erupting since September.
Twenty national flights were cancelled on Saturday, said a spokesman for the Spanish airport authority.
Air travel to the island in the Spanish-owned Canaries archipelago, off the Atlantic coast of North Africa, has been regularly affected since the volcano erupted on September 19 for the first time in 50 years.
No one has died in the eruption on the island of 85,000 people, but it caused serious damage and led to the evacuation of more than 7,000 people, with some buildings swallowed by lava flows.
More than 1,000 hectares of land and more than 2,600 buildings were destroyed, according to the European geospatial measurement system, Copernicus.
Provisional damage was estimated on Friday at nearly 900 million euros ($1 billion), according to the region.
During a visit on Friday and Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced new aid for the economy and infrastructure of the island, which depends in particular on tourism and banana cultivation.
The island of La Palma is experiencing its third eruption in a century, after those of the San Juan volcano in 1949 and the Teneguia in 1971.
Scientists have said the latest eruption could last up to three months.
This is not the first time all flights to and from the island have been cancelled, with the same happening earlier this month on November 3.
With flights cancelled, some tourists who went to the island on a sightseeing trip to witness the eruption had to wait in long lines for ferries to leave the island.
Madrid resident, Patricia Privado, 30, described the erupting volcano earlier this month as 'a spectacle of nature'.
'It is worth it,' she said of her trip. 'To hear it roar, to see how the lava falls. You have to experience it.'
Leon Pena, 65, said he came from the nearby island of Fuerteventura to see what he called 'something unique'.
Both said they knew flight cancellations were a possibility, but they didn't let that deter them from traveling to La Palma.
They also saw their trips as a way of supporting the local economy by spending money on the island, which has suffered greatly from the eruption.
Earlier this month, residents were questioning where financial aid promised by the Spanish government was.
In October, the government pledged 225 million euros in aid, and by the start of November, some 21 million euros of that has been disbursed.
Sanchez said at the time his administration would transfer a further 18.8 million euros for the agriculture and fishing industries and 5 million euros to tackle the 'social aspect' of the crisis.
The volcano's constant roar and numerous earthquakes have also kept locals on edge, and earlier in the month fears were again raised over possible toxic gas being released into the air as the second stream of lava reached the Atlantic ocean.
The stream of molten rock , which began erupting in mid-September, reached the water near the popular surf spot of Los Guirres beach on November 1.
A video uploaded by Spain's Geology and Mining Institute at the time showed rivers of molten rock sliding into the sea and large rocks rolling down a cliff, causing a cone of debris to emerge from the waterline.
Unlike the first time lava reached the ocean - just over a month ago - authorities said there was no need for residents to stay indoors.
'New confinements are not necessary because the populations are far away from the point of contact with the sea that occurred last night,' an emergency services spokesperson told Reuters earlier this month.
Few people live in the affected area, which is mostly banana plantations.
Early on in the eruption authorities had feared that the reaction between the superheated lava and seawater could unleash powerful explosions and set off toxic gas clouds.
During the last major eruption on the island, some 50 years ago, a man died after inhaling such gases.
La Palma's council said on Tuesday that seismic activity around the eruption site, as well as emissions of toxic sulphur dioxide, had been decreasing and the air quality remained good across most of the island.",-2
107,"The United Kingdom on Saturday recorded 40,941 daily COVID-19 cases, a decrease of seven percent on last week's cases, government data showed.
The figures also showed 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test - versus 157 seven days earlier - bringing the country's total deaths to 143,866.
Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 168,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. 
Release of the figures came after a SAGE adviser moved to reassure Britons the UK will not see a spike in Covid-19 cases like Austria and Germany.
But Professor John Edmunds said that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'.
'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmunds told Sky.
He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on.
'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane.
'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.'
Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmunds told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step.
'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' 
This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections.
Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.
But Mr Edmunds said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position'. 
The British Government has repeatedly rejected pleas to implement its Plan B, which would see similar measures to what are being levied on Ireland. But Boris Johnson has admitted a full-blown lockdown could still be on the cards if cases spike.
This comes amid a fresh wave of Covid infections on the continent that has sent nations back into draconian restrictions and could see excess deaths start to rise again.
Italy is considering a lockdown of the unvaccinated, it emerged yesterday, which would make it the latest country to impose the controversial intervention after Austria announced lockdown would return on Monday.
And Germany's incoming government has said that it wants unvaccinated people to be barred from going to work and travelling on public transport amid what Angela Merkel calls 'dramatic' infection levels. The Netherlands has also introduced a 7pm curfew for pubs and restaurants amid rising cases there.
Both Austria and the Czech Republic have announced the return of lockdowns from Monday, with Germany poised to follow suit after health officials warned they cannot rule out a full shutdown.
Meanwhile, Slovakia intends to bring in harsher restrictions if its current lockdown of unvaccinated people does not curb the rise in cases.
The reintroduction of restrictions across Europe have sparked a fierce backlash and fevered protests broke out in cities including Rotterdam overnight, where riot police fired warning shots - injuring protestors marching against the Covid measures.
Today, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Vienna with the far-right opposition Freedom Party among those who have called for the protest and vowed to combat the new restrictions.
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy.  ",-2
108,"Cricket whistleblower Azeem Rafiq has been accused of sending 'creepy' Whatsapp messages to a teenage girl who has gone public with her allegations.
Gayathri Ajith, 16 at the time, told the Yorkshire Post she received texts from the former Yorkshire cricketer about kissing her and inviting her to dinner after meeting her on a flight from Manchester to Dubai in 2015.
Rafiq last week apologised for sending anti-semitic messages on Facebook after his description of racism he experienced at Yorkshire Cricket Club named several top players at the top of the sport. 
In shocking testimony before MPs, Rafiq broke down in tears as he made racial discrimination claims against Tim Bresnan, Matthew Hoggard, Alex Hales, Gary Ballance and David 'Bumble' Lloyd. 
The spin bowler turned racism whistleblower also claimed the word P*** was 'used constantly' during his time at Yorkshire CCC as he gave explosive testimony to MPs.
In one shocking claim, he gave a harrowing account of having red wine forced down his throat by older players at his local team when he was 15 and a devout Muslim - before he drank more heavily from 2012 'to try to fit in'.  
But Rafiq is now the subject of further claims about his character from local Yorkshire media after his whistleblowing sent shockwaves through the sport. 
Ms Ajith claimed she received the messages from the former Yorkshire cricketer, who was then aged 24, in December 2015.  
According to the messages, Mr Rafiq told the girl: 'u know what I wanted to do on the plane?. 
The message continued: 'I want to grab you push u up against wall and kiss you.'
Ms Ajith also alleges that Mr Rafiq had asked her to join him for dinner in Dubai. 
She said she had told the cricketer that she was 17 to 'appear a bit older' and so she could join him having a vodka and coke while onboard the aircraft. 
After receiving the messages, Ms Ajith responded: 'Do you realise that I'm only 17?' 
It is alleged Mr Rafiq responded: 'Does tht mean it not allowed to want to kiss me... wud u have let me kiss u?'
Ms Ajith, who is now 22, said the messages appeared 'creepy'. Responding to the proposition, Ms Ajith replied: 'How do I know that you're not some absolute pervert?'
Speaking to the Yorkshire Post last night, a spokesperson for Rafiq's legal team said: 'This was put to us late on a Friday evening. We need to look into this, so cannot comment further for now.' 
His legal team have since confirmed they are looking into the case but declined to comment further when pressed by MailOnline. 
Speaking to the Yorkshire Post, Ms Asjith added: 'I was just kind of shocked by the crudity of those messages. They were just so vulgar.
'I'm not disputing any of his racism claims, because I'm sure they're very true experiences. But certain aspects of what he said just don't really sit right with me.
'If he was being forced to drink by his teammates, then surely that wouldn't then mean he would be drinking alone on a flight and encouraging a 17-year-old girl to be drinking with him.'  
The former Yorkshire spinner, widely praised for highlighting racial discrimination in cricket, appeared before a parliamentary select committee this week to lift the lid on his own experience but has been forced to confront his own past shortcomings.
Ahead of a game-wide meeting due to take place at The Oval on Friday, an historic exchange with former Warwickshire and Leicestershire player Ateeq Javid in which Rafiq made offensive remarks was uncovered by The Times.
'I am ashamed of this exchange and have now deleted it so as not to cause further offence,' the 30-year-old wrote on Twitter.
'I was 19 at the time and I hope and believe I am a different person today. I am incredibly angry at myself and I apologise to the Jewish community and everyone who is rightly offended by this.
'At no point will I ever try and defend the indefensible. For those I have hurt I am sincerely sorry.
'I will continue to front up and own any more mistakes I have made.'
In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, he said: 'The circumstances do differ. I don't think I've ever played with anyone Jewish, so it was not exactly the same. But I don't want to play it down. I've hurt people. My genuine feeling is that I deserve the flak. I f***ed up.'
But he told the newspaper that his comments were not equivalent to the racist abuse he suffered, pointing out that he had red wine forced into his mouth when his Muslim faith prevented him from drinking booze.
Rafiq told the JC: 'I'm deeply sorry. I don't recall making any other antisemitic remarks, but I'll go back and think about it. People are going to go through my whole life looking for things I've done. I admit I've made mistakes.'
 A spokesperson for Mr Rafiq told MailOnline: 'This was put to us late on a Friday evening. We need to look into this, so cannot comment further for now.'
Azeem Rafiq today begged British Jews to forgive him as he admitted he 'f***ed up' and 'deserves the flak' over anti-Semitic tropes sent in messages to a teammate - but the ex-cricketer insisted his words 'do differ' from the racism he suffered for years at Yorkshire.
Mr Rafiq made the offensive remarks about Atif Sheikh, an Asian cricketer who was playing for Derbyshire, who they accused of not paying a dinner bill because 'he is a Jew'.
Rafiq, then 19, wrote on Facebook: 'Hahaha he is a Jew. Probs go after my 2nds again.' He later added: 'How wrong is that? Only Jews do that sort of s**t.' 
In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, he said: 'The circumstances do differ. I don't think I've ever played with anyone Jewish, so it was not exactly the same. But I don't want to play it down. I've hurt people. My genuine feeling is that I deserve the flak. I f***ed up.'
But he told the newspaper that his comments were not equivalent to the racist abuse he suffered, pointing out that he had red wine forced into his mouth when his Muslim faith prevented him from drinking booze. 
He said: 'I'm deeply sorry. I don't recall making any other antisemitic remarks, but I'll go back and think about it. People are going to go through my whole life looking for things I've done. I admit I've made mistakes.'

109,"An armored truck spewed cash all over a San Diego freeway this week after one of its doors burst open, and now the FBI and the California Highway Patrol are looking for those who ran off with the money.
'If anyone picked up cash, we ask you to bring it to the office in Vista immediately,' a CHP spokesperson told Fox 5. 'I just want to give everyone a head's up that there is a lot of video evidence.' 
They are giving people 48 hours to return the money or face 'potential criminal charges.' Two people have already been arrested, officials said.
Drivers stopped what they were doing Monday and scrambled to pick up 'free' money on the northbound side of Interstate 5 near Carlsbad, California. 
The trunk was on its way to the Federal Reserve to make the deposit when the back doors burst open around 10 a.m., authorities said. 
The FBI and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) are now looking for people who took the money, after already arresting two people who got locked out of their car during the frenzy. It is unknown how much money came out of the trunk, nor how much is still missing.
Fitness guru Demi Bagby, from San Diego, was identified as one of the persons of interest after she posted a video to her Instagram account showing her and her friends picking up money. 
'This is the most insane thing I've ever seen, someone dropped money all over the freeway and San Diego has shut down, literally it has shut down. Look at the freeway right now, oh my gosh,' Bagby says in a video she posted for her 2.5 million followers. 
'Literally everyone stopped on the freeway to get money off the freeway. This is insane,' she says.  
The video also showed others with huge stacks of cash in their hands, as well as two other women who were seen picking up cash. The FBI released screenshots of Bagby's video and are wanting to talk to those featured in it. 
Another driver even covered up their license plate with what appears to be a white towel to avoid being identified. 
As Bagby and her friends drove past the armored trunk, it appeared that its drivers had left the scene. The drivers of the truck were seen earlier talking to the police. 
Another driver, Travis Fisher, told Fox 5 that he thought there was an accident before noticing the money. 
'I see all these things floating around and I realize it’s money,' Fisher told Fox 5. 'It was pretty crazy. Just everywhere, there was a sea of bills, everywhere.' 
Fisher estimated there were thousands of dollars scattered across the roadway. 
CHP and the FBI are now calling on those who took the money to return it, as it's a crime to steal government property. 
Police collected the fallen money in garbage bags but even after they cleared the scene, some stragglers still stayed behind in search for more. 
Lawyer Greg Wiseman told Fox 5 that the 'finder's keepers' attitude won't get them very far. 
'People get the wrong idea, they think ""finder's keepers,"" they think ""possession is nine-tenths of a law,"" but that's not the law,' he said. 
He said the 'negligent' act does not 'create a windfall where people just get to say ""right place, right time"" and keep the money.' 
Many commenters slammed Bagby and her friends for filming themselves and other people, with one stating: 'This video will have you in court lmaoooo [sic] they track these people down.' 
Another also warned the fitness guru not to 'brag' about her gold mine: 'I wouldn't of bragged on camera about taking money if I were those people.' 
The influencer herself even commented: 'Who's coming to sizzler with us tonight?' Sizzler is a restaurant chain that was founded in California. 
Other commenters focused on the driver of the vehicle, writing: 'Someone's getting fired.' 
While others just wished it was them, one even asked for someone to come to the East Coast and 'drop some bills.' 
'Damn someone come to the east coast and drop some bills for us!' 
Another wrote: 'The only time you wish you were stuck on the freeway! send us all some.' 
It is unknown if Bagby and her friends are still in possession of the money.  
Stealing government property can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine.  
The FBI and CHP are investigating.  
DailyMail.com has contacted Bagby for comment.  ",-2
110,"A centuries-old Charles Dickens letter written in code has been offered up to the public to help solve it - with a cash prize.
The so-called 'Tavistock letter' is one of a number of manuscripts which Dickens wrote in a modified version of brachygraphy - a form of shorthand popular in the 18th century.
Researchers have been stumped by the code and have now turned to amateur cryptographers to try and decipher it, offering a £300 prize to do so before New Year's Eve.
The prize is being offered by the Dickens Code Project led by the University of Leicester and the University of Foggia and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
The letter has never been read despite being one of the ten surviving manuscripts from Dickens after he burned a trove of documents at his Gad's Hill home in Kent.
The blue letter paper of the manuscript is headed with the words 'Tavistock House' the London house where Dickens wrote Bleak House, A Tale of Two Cities and other works.
It is from this heading where the letter has got its name. 
Hugo Bowles, professor of English at the University of Foggia in Italy told The Times: 'It looks simple but really is not.
'You read back the consonants and fill in the gaps.
'It is a little like playing Scrabble in your head.'
'Dickens clearly liked word games and puzzles and would have been very good at them, hence the use of this system.'
Dickens' shorthand system was partially illuminated by researchers using a notebook stored at the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester.
Dr Claire Wood, lecturer in Victorian literature at the University of Leicester, told the Times: '[Dickens] throws out the symbols that are more obscure and that aren't coming up in what he is reporting on. 
'Instead he creates new marks that make more sense and that save him time as a shorthand writer.'
But the genius' messy handwriting still poses a problem for anyone hoping to claim the cash on offer. 
Professor Bowles told The Times that Dickens' messy shorthand has been a major hurdle for the researchers in trying to figure out what the letter actually says.
He said: 'Unfortunately, the notebook is not nearly enough to help us decode everything.
'It gives a few of his extra symbols, which are useful, but a lot of the problem is actually connected to his writing.
'Much like messy handwriting, he has messy shorthand.'
Researchers have employed a series of techniques to try and decipher Dickens' difficult code including finding translated pieces and working backwards and also employing machine learning.
Both techniques have failed due to the lack of material on offer to try and figure out patterns.",-2
111,"A tech billionaire allegedly kept a spreadsheet of 5,000 women he has had sex with, one of them a teenager he paid off to keep quiet, despite losing his high-profile job over a sexual misconduct allegation in 2016.
Michael Goguen, 57, a former partner at Sequoia Capital who now heads his own firm, has been sued by four former employees who say they helped manage his 'harem' of women.
The explosive lawsuit claims the investor met with the women at various safe houses or at a 'boom boom' room in the basement of his bar in Whitefish, a small town in Montana where he now lives.
The married billionaire, who has two children, once asked his employee to arrange a hit on a former friend who knew too much about his personal life, according to the lawsuit. 
A retired Whitefish police chief now says that Goguen - whom he compared to serial predators Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein - 'has to be stopped.'
These are the latest allegations of sexual impropriety leveled against Goguen, who in 2016 was accused of 'countless hours of forced sodomy' by his former girlfriend, exotic dancer Amber Baptiste.
The latest 135-page lawsuit was filed in February by former employees of Goguen’s Amyntor Group LLC, a security contractor, according to the New York Post.
It lays out a complex operation headed by Goguen to protect his simultaneous affairs. The breakdown of the operation, and the employees who helped it run, can be traced through multiple guilty pleas by former employees and associates who threatened to speak out about the alleged scheme.
Among the plaintiffs is Matthew Marshall, the former head of Amyntor who quickly grew to become Goguen's 'right-hand man.' 
Marshall pled guilty to wire fraud and other charges earlier this month after he pretended to be an elite member of the Marine Corps and asked Goguen for money for 'off the books' missions, according to the Flathead Beacon.
But Marshall says Goguen, who is currently married to his fourth wife, allegedly kept a 'harem' of 'numerous women, including married women, strippers, and prostitutes,' who he bought homes for and used for 'illicit sexual activity.' 
Goguen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. 
The tech investor is worth more than $5 billion, according to the New York Post. 
He flew some of the women in his private $42 million jet. 
'Marshall was being asked to purchase, out of his personal accounts, vehicles, jewelry, earnest money deposits on properties, and to provide cash or other items for Goguen’s mistresses, or as hush-money payoffs to Goguen’s acquaintances and employees who had ""learned too much"" about Goguen’s sexual misconduct and crimes, and the Goguen Sexual Scheme,' the lawsuit states.
'Goguen informed Marshall it was best to have him pay the property expenses, especially any expenses that were solely for Goguen’s safe houses, out of his personal account to avoid his then wife Jordana from discovering that Goguen owned a number of properties that he used extensively for extramarital affairs because Jordana had visibility over Goguen’s accounts at that time.'
The lawsuit, which is asking for $800 million in damages, claims various violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) act. 
It accuses Goguen of offering 'gifts' to the women - including alcohol, travel, jewelry, cash and health care expenses - 'to perform other deviant sexual acts with him, and/or to maintain their silence as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.' 
He gave one woman a credit card and bought her a five-bedroom home after her husband, a prominent businessman, found out about their affair and began divorce proceedings, according to the Post. 
Goguen also allegedly gave Eric Payne, who did construction for Goguen, an office in the basement of Casey's Bar, an establishment that he owns in Whitefish.
The office 'was passcode protected, had a built-in full size stripper pole, and commonly referred to as the ""boom boom"" room where he and Payne could procure young women to engage in sexual acts with them for money, drugs or other items of value as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.'
Goguen was vindictive against those who tried to put a stop to his nefarious activities, according to the lawsuit viewed by DailyMail.com.
His friend Bryan Nash called him a 'pedophile' after Goguen brought his two daughters to Nash's house but later absconded with their high-school-aged babysitter to have sex with her in a cottage on the property. 
The age of the babysitter is not clear. 
'Goguen threatened to kill Nash if he “said anything to anybody” about his “character flaw,” later telling Nash that he “owns Montana” and “supplies law enforcement,'"" the lawsuit states.
Goguen then began having sex with Nash's wife and paying for her divorce proceedings, allegedly costing Nash more money in a drawn out legal battle.
He used Marshall to investigate and harass Nash, who went to authorities 'to no avail,' the lawsuit states. 
In September 2014, Goguen texted Marshall using the encrypted texting service Wickr, writing: 'Nashf*** has pushed me too far and his occasional reminders he might help blow the lid off my personal life requires an extreme response. The cyber route isn't having the impact on him that I was hoping to achieve,' according to the lawsuit.
'Buddy, he’s f*****with my life, career, etc. and the potential for me being destroyed if he gets traction with the authorities or press is significant. This requires an extreme response. He will f***** destroy the ""bigger picture"" for us if he's not stopped. 
'He needs to be killed. I know that's a VERY big ask but we are in defcon 5. We can discuss details in person but we do NOT have conversations about this on our cell phones. Wickr only…'
Marshall did not try to have Nash killed, the lawsuit states.
In May 2020, Nash pled guilty to one count of blackmail after prosecutors say he threatened to release negative information about Goguen if he didn't pay him $250,000 to cover his divorce proceedings, according to the Flathead Beacon. 
Goguen is from Bedford, Massachusetts, according to the Post. 
He went to Cornell and Stanford universities, where he studied electrical engineering, and joined Sequoia Capital - an early investor in Google, YouTube and PayPal - in 1996, according to his LinkedIn.
He was let go from his job at Sequoia after Amber Baptiste accused him of physical and sexual assault over a 13-year period after he picked her up at a Texas strip club, according to the Post.
She said he sodomized her for 'six hours at a time' and forced her to call him 'king' and 'emperor' in a lawsuit asking for $40 million.
Goguen then told Marshall to act as his 'general 100x more aggressive than Patton was, to coordinate and make sure everything is happening that should be happening — PR firms, private investigators criminal side, local PR, everything,' according to February's lawsuit, emphasizing the lengths he was willing to go to, and the money he was wiling to spend, to punish those who hurt him. 
Back in 2016, Sequoia called Baptiste's allegations 'unproven and unrelated to Sequoia' but said that Goguen's departure 'was the appropriate course of action.'
In 2019, a judge dismissed Baptiste's lawsuit for failing to provide relevant documents or to submit to a medical examination, according to TechCrunch. 
A different judge then found that Baptiste committed fraud and extortion and granted Goguen a restraining order preventing her from repeating her claims, according to the Flathead Beacon.
The latest lawsuit does not name any of the allegedly 100 women in Goguen's 'harem.'
It does note, however, that he's bought some of them homes, including a multi-million dollar home in Santa Monica, California for a woman whom he allegedly got pregnant multiple times but paid to have abortions. 
Retired Whitefish Police chief Bill Dial, who is also suing Goguen, told the Post: 'This man has to be stopped. He’s a billionaire a la Harvey Weinstein and Epstein. There's a lot of people in this community who know what he’s about and they’re afraid of him.'
Goguen's employees say that a detective by the name of Shane Erickson was 'forced to resign' after failing to investigate sexual assault allegations against Goguen while 'improperly accepting gifts and other compensation' from him.
'Mr. Erickson was forced to resign from his position as a Police Detective with the Whitefish Police Department for failing to investigate the alleged conduct by Goguen and improperly accepting gifts and other compensation from Defendant Goguen while employed with the Whitefish Police Department,' the lawsuit states.
The teenager, identified only as Pam Doe, was given alcohol and cocaine by Goguen, Payne and a third individual, the lawsuit states.
In an email she wrote to her lawyer, she said she had been asked to pop out of a cake at a party when she was 17, wherein after she was 'roofied' and asked to be an 'escort,' to multiple men.
During the course of his investigation, Erickson told Marshall that Goguen admitted he paid her $1,200 to have sex with him. 
'During the course of April, May and June 2018, Det. Erickson openly shared with Marshall the fact that he was spending time with Goguen, including having dinner at his house, spending time on Whitefish lake, going on a coyote hunt and doing other leisure activities with their families,' the lawsuit says, adding that Goguen took Erickson via private jet on his 'yearly week-long ~$20,000 elk hunt in Colorado with private guides.'
Pam Doe eventually recanted her allegations. She was allegedly 'forced to sign a non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreement' and paid off. 
Whitefish police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. ",-2
112,"The former chief immigration officer has warned that migrants 'know they've won the jackpot' when they arrive in the UK as the number of Channel crossings hit a record 4,000 for the month yesterday.
Kevin Saunders, former chief immigration officer for the UK Border Force, said the UK was 'very attractive' to migrants adding, 'people know they're not going to be removed' once they arrive.
His comments came as dozens more migrants were pictured arriving into the UK today, escorted by Border Force at Folkestone Harbour this morning.
Photos from the scene show a dinghy full of people thought to be migrants being approached by a Border Force vessel which already appears to be carrying other migrants onboard. 
This comes after, Boris Johnson ordered a Whitehall review into the cross-Channel migrant crisis with the PM is said to be 'exasperated' by his Government's failure to reduce the number of migrants on small boats making the journey and wants ministers to 'redouble' efforts to 'fix' the crisis.
Ex immigration chief Kevin Saunders told Times Radio this morning: 'The problem is that the UK is just too attractive, so people will continue to come while we're very, very attractive.
'People know that they're not going to be removed, this is why they destroy all their documentation.
'It's a real worry because we don't know who people are, because they destroy all their documents, they don't give us their right names, where they come from, or anything along those lines.
'The biggest draw is these people know everything in the United Kingdom is free, they are going to get education, medical treatment, money, accommodation, it's all a big, big draw.'
Mr Saunders said people who arrive in the UK via the Channel must be processed offshore to enable officials to turn away failed asylum claims.
He told Times Radio: 'The most effective way would be to take all the people who have arrived in the UK to an offshore processing centre and deal with it offshore.
'That is the only way you will stop people from coming into the UK. We've seen trying to do it with the French on land, on the Channel, nothing works.'
When asked why it had to be offshore, he said: 'People will still come to the UK, because they know we are not going to be able to remove them from the United Kingdom when their asylum claim fails.
'How many was it that we removed this year, was it five? Some 30,000 arrived and we removed five - not very good really, is it?
'They know that once they're in the UK they've won the jackpot.' 
Yesterday, the number of migrants crossing the Channel to the UK surpassed 4,000 to hit a new monthly record with weeks still to go - as Emmanuel Macron accused the government of 'oscillating between partnership and provocation' over the crisis. 
Seven migrants have been killed and eight others injured after the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in lost control and crashed near a motorway toll station in northern Greece, authorities said.
Police said the vehicle carrying 15 people had been travelling on a motorway from the area of Greece's north-eastern border with Turkey towards the north's main city of Thessaloniki when it crashed just after midnight.
The vehicle had been travelling at high speed and the driver lost control as he tried to exit the motorway, hitting a toll booth and crashing into a nearby storage container, police said.
The injured were four men from Pakistan, one from Afghanistan and two from Nepal, as well as the 35-year-old Moldovan driver, who police suspect was acting as a smuggler.
They have been transported to hospitals in the north-eastern Greek towns of Xanthi and Komotini.
The seven people killed in the crash included one woman.
Their nationalities were not immediately known, authorities said.
Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
The most frequently used routes for clandestine entries into Greece are the short but dangerous sea crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands, or crossing the heavily guarded land border between Greece and Turkey.
A total of 78 people crossed the Channel by small boat yesterday, according to official Home Office figures. Border Force officials rescued or intercepted migrants making the perilous trip in four separate crossings, while French officials stopped 254 prior to departure. 
The new arrivals brought the total number to have made it to the UK this month to 4,019, exceeding the previous record of 3,879 in September.
Former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been put in charge of the review ordered by Boris Johnson, according to The Times.
It will seek to find solutions to the crisis and make sure all departments – not only the Home Office – are contributing.
The review follows a week of record migrant Channel crossings, with 1,000 reaching the British shores on Tuesday alone and around 24,000 making the journey this year. The figure is almost triple the number that arrived in 2020.
Mr Johnson's frustration comes after a series of promises made by Home Secretary Priti Patel to tackle the crisis.
They culminated this week with the suggestion that asylum seekers could be sent abroad for processing. Countries including Albania are being considered as possible destinations. 
Last night it emerged that Ms Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants which will see new restrictions imposed on asylum seekers, as well the construction of new purpose-built reception centres, according to The Daily Telegraph.
In Greece, migrants face regular checks on their movements which include curfews to stop them going off the radar.
Earlier this week, Mr Macron took a swipe at Home Secretary Priti Patel for her criticisms of France's handling of the issue, saying: 'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation… we must step up collaboration.'
The president - who did not provide specific examples of alleged UK provocations - also pledged to use Paris's rotating presidency of the EU to ramp up work to address the origins of the crisis. 
The intervention came amid increasing pressure on Ms Patel and Boris Johnson to find a way of stemming the numbers arriving illegally on British shores.
One senior MP told MailOnline it had been one of the most significant sources of unrest when the PM appeared before the Tory backbench 1922 committee earlier this week.
'Where most people's concerns were being addressed was illegal immigration,' they said. 'We have the constant drip drip drip of small groups but cumulatively large groups of illegal immigrants arriving on our shores. We need to do something about it.'

The number of migrants crossing the Channel to the UK yesterday surpassed 4,000 to hit a new monthly record with weeks still to go - as Emmanuel Macron accused the government of 'oscillating between partnership and provocation' over the crisis. 
A total of 78 people crossed the Channel by small boat yesterday, according to official Home Office figures. Border Force officials rescued or intercepted migrants making the perilous trip in four separate crossings, while French officials stopped 254 prior to departure. 
The new arrivals bring the total number to have made it to the UK this month to 4,019, exceeding the previous record of 3,879 in September. This year's total is 23,761. 
It came as Mr Macron took a swipe at Home Secretary Priti Patel for her criticisms of France's handling of the issue, saying: 'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation… we must step up collaboration'.
The president - who did not provide specific examples of alleged UK provocations - also pledged to use Paris's rotating presidency of the EU to ramp up work to address the origins of the crisis. 
The intervention came amid increasing pressure on Ms Patel and Boris Johnson to find a way of stemming the numbers arriving illegally on British shores.
One senior MP told MailOnline it had been one of the most significant sources of unrest when the PM appeared before the Tory backbench 1922 committee earlier this week.
'Where most people's concerns were being addressed was illegal immigration,' they said. 'We have the constant drip drip drip of small groups but cumulatively large groups of illegal immigrants arriving on our shores. We need to do something about it.'    
Ms Patel looks to be trying to take the heat out of the row with France, unleashing an excoriating attack last night on the broader EU's open borders policy.
The Home Secretary railed against Europe's lack of border checks – the so-called Schengen zone – which has allowed thousands of migrants to sweep across the continent.
She also announced that she had secured agreement with Mr Macron's government – once legal changes have been approved – to use drones and tracking technology against people smugglers.      
Yeesterday, the Home Office confirmed a migrant who got into difficulty off the Dover coast this morning had to be airlifted to safety by HM Coastguard.
Meanwhile, the French Coastguard rescued 28 migrants off the coast of Gravelines in northern France after their small boat got into difficulty.
They were escorted to Calais Port by officials, where they were met by police.
Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said: 'We are facing a global migration crisis and the number of people arriving on UK shores is unacceptable.
'We must work closely with our European and international partners to target the ruthless organised criminal gangs behind these deadly crossing and welcome the French Government's commitment to step up action to prevent crossings, including increased surveillance, greater intelligence sharing and deployment of frontline operations
'The New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken system, break the deadly business model of the people smugglers and prevent further loss of life.' 
France takes the rotating presidency of the EU in six weeks' time, with the bloc working out how to react to claims Belarus is engineering major migrant flows to destabilise the area.
In an interview with French newspaper la Voix du Nord, Mr Macron - who is facing a stern challenge from right-wing politicians at looming elections - called for a tougher response.
'We must take several actions: prevent the establishment of lasting camps, act to dismantle the smuggling networks and strengthen work with the countries of origin to prevent these flows,' he said. 'I will carry reforms under the French presidency of the EU.'
Mr Macron also hit out over tensions between London and Paris.
'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation. We need to further strengthen collaboration,' he said. 
'If those who want to join Britain have family there, it must be part of family reunification. If they are smuggled, we have to break this system.'
Downing Street said the UK was working 'extremely closely' with the French to prevent illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
A No 10 spokesman said there was a 'global migration crisis' which required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe.
'Our work to date has prevented more than 20,000 migrant attempts so far this year but we have been clear that we need to do more, both ourselves and the French, which is why we continue to work extremely closely with them,' the spokesman said.
'We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings.
'This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem, so we need shared solutions.'
Keir Starmer accused Mr Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
The Labour leader linked the increase in numbers making the dangerous journey to Government cuts in Britain's foreign aid budget.
'We have not had strong enough agreements with France on this and we haven't done the work upstream,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
'One of the reasons many Tory MPs were unhappy with the Government for cutting its foreign aid budget is because they knew that budget is used in part to deal with some of the problems that are driving the movement of people.
'You will never solve the immediate problem if you don't solve the upstream problem. The Home Secretary repeatedly says in strong language what she is going to do about the immediate problem and delivers absolutely nothing.
'You have got to do the work upstream otherwise you will never solve this problem.' 
Speaking on a trip to the US, Ms Patel said offshore processing centres remained 'on the table' but refused to discuss specific negotiations. There have been suggestions that migrants could be sent and held abroad while their cases are looked at.
'We keep everything on the table… and this is why the new Nationality and Borders Bill is just so important,' she said..
'I'm the only Home Secretary over a 20-year period that has taken on the challenge of reforming what is fundamentally a broken system of asylum and illegal migration.' She admitted for the first time that Britain was facing a 'mass migration crisis'.
In a marked a change of tone after months of friction with the French government, she said the flow of small boats must be treated as a 'Europe-wide problem'. She said France was 'overwhelmed' by asylum seekers heading for the UK.
And she blamed Brussels – which governs EU border policy – for failing to act. 'Let's not forget the real problem on illegal migration flows is [that] the EU has no border protections whatsoever,' she said.
'On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. Other countries have to do much more in terms of border protection.'
Seven out of ten migrants who attempt to cross the Channel have entered France through Belgium according to French officials, Miss Patel said.
She added: 'The EU's Schengen zone is free movement and open borders. They do not have border controls and border checks. There is no united position across EU member states in terms of how to tackle this issue. It's an EU competency issue.'
Deploying highly-charged language, the Home Secretary went on: 'There is a mass migration crisis. I've said this from day one – from the minute I walked into the Home Office. For everyone who complains about this – and no-one is more angry and frustrated about this than myself, alongside the British taxpayers – there isn't a silver bullet.
'There's no point saying, 'Well, you could just push boats back'. It will not stop it. There are all sorts of issues with criminal gangs, smugglers, etc.' Ms Patel said of the French: 'I think it's fair to say they are overwhelmed. That is a fact.
'We are constantly pressing France on this and we're asking them to be honest with us about where the gaps are because they can't be everywhere. We have a very, very professional working relationship, but no one country can fix this on their own.'

The Prime Minister has ordered a Whitehall review into the cross-Channel migrant crisis, it emerged last night.
Boris Johnson is said to be 'exasperated' by his Government's failure to reduce the number of migrants on small boats making the journey and wants ministers to 'redouble' efforts to 'fix' the crisis.
Former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been put in charge of the review, according to The Times.
It will seek to find solutions to the crisis and make sure all departments – not only the Home Office – are contributing.
The review follows a week of record migrant Channel crossings, with 1,000 reaching the British shores on Tuesday alone and around 24,000 making the journey this year. The figure is almost triple the number that arrived in 2020.
Mr Johnson's frustration comes after a series of promises made by Home Secretary Priti Patel to tackle the crisis.
They culminated this week with the suggestion that asylum seekers could be sent abroad for processing. Countries including Albania are being considered as possible destinations. 
Last night it emerged that Ms Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants which will see new restrictions imposed on asylum seekers, as well the construction of new purpose-built reception centres, according to The Daily Telegraph.
In Greece, migrants face regular checks on their movements which include curfews to stop them going off the radar.
Speaking of Mr Johnson's frustration that the migrant crisis has not yet been solved, a senior government source said the PM saw it as one of his biggest priorities and he was concerned that 'after two years there are still no viable solutions'.
Germany is becoming a hub for migrants attempting to reach Britain, it emerged last night.
Asylum seekers are massing in the country as a new staging post for Channel crossings masterminded by people-smuggling gangs.
Organised crime groups are also using German sites to store dinghies and other small boats used to attempt crossings, sources said.
Six out of ten migrants arrive in France only on the day they attempt their crossing, travelling there through Belgium and the Netherlands.
A UK government source described Germany as 'the established hub for criminal trafficking gangs' in Europe. 
It is also a key location in the criminals' supply chains, where boats, life jackets and other equipment is sourced for Channel crossings, they added.
'Boris is exasperated. He's told ministers to redouble efforts to fix this, no matter how difficult it is,' they said.
'If it looks bad now, it's going to look much worse in spring when it's warmer.'
In new plans being drawn up by the Home Office, migrants will have asylum claims thrown out if they abscond or misbehave.
The changes – which will require legislation – will be crucial in the operation of the new processing centres, which will house asylum seekers while their cases are scrutinised.
Migrants could also be issued with 'asylum apps' to track the progress of their applications on smartphones or computers in the centres.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has been impressed by the way Greece has digitised its asylum application process to track cases, sped up decisions and cut down on unnecessary paperwork.
Speaking to The Telegraph, Miss Patel said Greece had decided 'not to sit behind the EU block of competency'.
Ministers are also keen to avoid a repeat of riots at asylum centres.
'If they breach the rules, it will affect their asylum claim,' a source said.
'They would be told they have to be back in by a certain time, and so on. Terms would include preventing absconding.'
Some previously reported plans to tackle crossings have included the use of giant wave machines, nets to snare boat propellers and floating walls in the sea.
However, Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, told the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week that they were never considered'.
He added that the wave machine idea is 'bizarre'.
But the move to bring in Mr Barclay could be seen as an admission that the Home Secretary has not managed to tackle the issue.
It comes after Sir Keir Starmer accused Ms Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
The Labour leader said Ms Patel has not secured strong enough agreements with the French government to prevent migrants making the dangerous sea journey.
He said the Home Secretary repeatedly used 'strong language' to say how she would tackle the problem, but delivered 'absolutely nothing'.
October 15, 2019
Priti Patel vows to halve migrant crossings – then a tenth of the current level – by the end of the month and make them an 'infrequent phenomenon' by the spring of 2020.
'I am absolutely committed to doing everything in my power to stop these dangerous Channel crossings which are putting vulnerable lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Migrant numbers hit a record 1,185 in a day last week.
August 7, 2020
The Home Secretary backs sending Royal Navy patrols into the Channel.
'The number of illegal small boat crossings is appalling and unacceptably high.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Within hours, Ministry of Defence sources suggested the proposals were unworkable.
July 6, 2021
Miss Patel unveils powers for UK Border Force to turn back migrant boats and reduce asylum rights for people who arrive in Britain illegally.
'Access to the UK's asylum system should be based on need, not the ability to pay people smugglers.'
WHAT HAPPENED? The tactics have yet to be used amid opposition from France and even the UK Border Force over legal concerns.
July 20
She agrees to give France another £54million to tackle the crisis.
'The public are rightly angry that small boats are arriving on our shores, facilitated by appalling criminal gangs who profit from human misery and put lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? In October France accused the UK of withholding the money amid a row over whether Paris was doing enough to stop the boats. The first instalment of UK cash was later paid – but numbers coming over the Channel continue to rocket.
November 15
Miss Patel and French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, vow they will deliver on their pledge to prevent '100 per cent' of illegal crossings.
JOINT STATEMENT: 'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings... and make this deadly route unviable.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Days later the French embassy in London said 100 per cent 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
November 18
The Home Secretary launches an attack on the EU's open borders policy, blaming Brussels for the crisis.
'The real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – open borders. On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. They simply can't.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Free movement for people between member states in the so-called Schengen area is a fundamental EU principle and there is no prospect of it being changed. 
His attack came as Ms Patel blamed the EU's open borders – established by the Schengen Agreement – for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc.
Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was 'constantly pressing' the French on the issue, but that they were 'overwhelmed'.
'Let's not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – Schengen open borders,' she was quoted as saying.
It is thought at least 10 migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing.
It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British 'oscillate between partnership and provocation' when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: 'We need to further strengthen collaboration.'
Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensified recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where canisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants.
Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work 'extremely closely' with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe.
'We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings,' a No 10 spokesman said.
'This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions.'
Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britain's 'busted' asylum system.
Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a 'dysfunctional' system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in 2015.
Sir Keir said: 'My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted.
'This Government has been in power for 11 years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch.
'Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at.
'So if the asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.'
Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador to Britain flatly denied reports his country has been in discussions with the Government about hosting a processing centre for migrants who arrive in the UK.
Qirjako Qirko told LBC radio that there had been 'zero talks' between the two countries on the issue.
'It's absolutely fake news because as my prime minister stated yesterday – the foreign minister also tweeted yesterday – that doesn't exist, any negotiations between Albania and the UK regarding these processing centres,' he said.
'It will not be changed because my prime minister was crystal clear yesterday when he said that Albania… will never be a processing centre for illegal immigrants.'
Speaking on a trip this week, Ms Patel said offshore processing centres remained 'on the table' but refused to discuss specific negotiations. 
There have been suggestions that migrants could be sent and held abroad - such as in Albania - while their cases are looked at. 
'We keep everything on the table… and this is why the new Nationality and Borders Bill is just so important,' she said.
'I'm the only Home Secretary over a 20-year period that has taken on the challenge of reforming what is fundamentally a broken system of asylum and illegal migration.' She admitted for the first time that Britain was facing a 'mass migration crisis'.
And, after months of friction with the French government, Ms Patel appeared to change her tone when she said the flow of small boats needs to be treated as a 'Europe-wide problem'. 
She said France was 'overwhelmed' by asylum seekers heading for the UK.
And she blamed Brussels – which governs EU border policy – for failing to act. 'Let's not forget the real problem on illegal migration flows is [that] the EU has no border protections whatsoever,' she said.
'On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. Other countries have to do much more in terms of border protection.'

113,"A bird flu outbreak has been confirmed in Dorset today with officials culling 39 domestic ducks after a case of the 'highly pathogenic' H5N1 strain was found.
The strain of avian influenza was detected at a premises in Southbourne, Bournemouth.
To contain its spread, Government and local health officials are doing door-to-door testing in the area to check for any further cases. 
They have also constructed a 3km temporary exclusion zone to prevent animal movements.
Elsa Hatton, of Southbourne, said a case of the avian influenza H5N1 strain had been found in her flock of 39 domestic ducks. 
The domestic ducks were kept to sell eggs to the local community and have since been culled. 
Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus. 

Bird flu is unique in that it can be transmitted directly from birds to humans. 
There are 15 different strains of the virus. It is the H5N1 strain which is infecting humans and causing high death rates. 
Humans can catch bird flu directly through close contact with live infected birds and those who work with infected chickens are most at risk. 


'We sold eggs to local people for five years in Christchurch and have made many new connections and forged some wonderful friendships through selling eggs here in Southbourne for five years,' she told Dorset Live.
'We are truly heartbroken as ducks are such happy characters and were very much a part of our family.
'We’ll get some more ducks in due course, probably in the Spring.'
Mrs Hatton has shared a tribute to the ducks along with a photo before they were culled. 
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirmed the case in birds at the premises and the area is currently undergoing testing.
Other birds that pose a direct risk will be culled.
A BCP Council spokesperson said: 'Trading Standards Officers from BCP Council are working alongside officers from the Government’s Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) with measures to prevent the spread of the disease. 
'These measures include a cull of the birds who pose a direct risk, as well as further investigation over the weekend into premises in the area who are breeding or keeping birds.
'Please be advised that a 3km Temporary Control Zone has been constructed around an area centred on Castlemain Avenue at this time with regard to animal movements. 
'APHA and BCP Council officers will be knocking on doors in the zone from tomorrow to check for potential further cases. Please note that these officers will be carrying ID.'
Peter Haikin, Regulatory Services Manager, said: 'Avian Influenza predominantly affects only birds and is not considered to be an illness which poses a risk to the general public.' 
All bird keepers in Great Britain are now required by law to undergo certain biosecurity procedures following an outbreak of Avian Flu being declared to help prevent further spread.
Bird flu cases have also been reported in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Essex, Lancashire, North Yorkshire and Derbyshire. 
Last week, people in Lancashire were warned not to pick up any sick or dying birds after an outbreak of bird flu was confirmed at a poultry farm.
A temporary control zone was declared around the affected site in Salwick, near Preston.
Elsewhere, a protection zone was also set up in North Yorkshire after birds there were identified to have the H5N1 virus, the BBC reported.
Defra confirmed the strain of bird flu was found at a property near Leeming Bar, Hambleton, and that testing was underway. 
Earlier this month, a bird flu prevention zone was declared across the country after a number of cases of the virus were detected in captive and wild birds in England, Wales and Scotland.
Farms and bird keepers were ordered to toughen their biosecurity measures after the avian influenza was spotted in poultry at multiple sites across the UK.
The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) will see keepers with more than 500 birds have to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites.",-2
114,"A gang of 14 thieves stole about $120,00 worth of merchandise in broad daylight from a Chicago-area Louis Vuitton store as the Windy City's rampant crime spreads to its posh suburbs, police said. 
Shocking video shows the gang entering the store at the Oak Brook Center one at a time on Thursday after an armed guard went on a short break.  
Once they were all inside, the thieves pulled out trash bags from their coats and jumped to every corner of the store, stuffing their bags full of designer products. 
Some of the thieves took everything they could carry by hand, and in seconds, they all ran out of the store, located about 18 miles west of downtown Chicago.
So far this year in Chicago, thefts have seen a 14 percent spike, jumping to 11,093 from 9,424 in 2020. 
The guard at the luxury story quickly returned to the scene and tried to stop the gang, but they got away in three separate vehicles, Oak Brook Police told Fox News.
Officers were able to find one of the vehicles, a Dodge Charger, on Friday, which had been reported stolen last month in Chicago. 
The other two vehicles were believed to be a silver Lincoln MKZ and a red sports car.  
Oak Brook Police Chief James Kruger said police now have vehicle and license information on the suspects.
'We're nailing down all those leads now, our detectives are out working those leads,' he told Fox. 
The incident mirrored a robbery at a Louis Vuitton store last month only 30 miles away in Northbrook. 
Northbrook Police said a gang of 13 thieves and three getaway drivers targeted the Louis Vuitton in the Northbrook Court Mall, stealing about $66,000 worth of products on October 7. 
'We don't know if there is a connection yet, but certainly there are similarities and our investigators are talking to their investigators,' Kruger told ABC 7.
Oak Brook police are working with the Illinois attorney general to see if the two robberies are connected. ",-2
115,"Police have been on a recruitment drive discussing the vetting process for new officers not far from where Sarah Everard was abducted.
Around six officers with clipboards chatted to the public, along with around three civilian staff in a bid to get more applicants to join the Met Police.
Officers handed out leaflets about the new policing degree and encouraged passers by to join the force at the stand outside Tooting Broadway station in south London today.
Signs around the stand read 'a career like no other' and 'what is the vetting process?'
Staff involved in the vetting process also talked about how the checks are carried out.
One said a new measure would see an applicant with a domestic abuse conviction flagged up now facing a string of extra interviews.
These include meetings with management and unions to discuss the allegations and decide if the application should be refused.
But some women did not think the force is doing enough to protect the public from rogue officers in the wake of the shocking murder of Ms Everard at the hands of serving cop Wayne Couzens in March this year.
Alana Nikanorova, 31, from Streatham, south London, said: 'I don't think they have done enough to address the institutional problems at the heart of the police.
'They [the police] can tweak the vetting process, but it's not enough. They have to do a lot more to regain so many women's trust.
'The advice they gave after Wayne Couzens was convicted was absolutely ridiculous and the way they policed the [Sarah Everard] vigil was even worse. And that attitude comes from the very top so it's needs wholesale changes.
'It'll take a lot more to put right all those problems.'
After Couzens was sentencend to a whole life term before Met advised women to flag down a bus if they felt unsafe being stopped by a male officer.
Sara Maleaux, 27, from Tooting, added: 'I never had a problem with the police before, but after what happened this year and how the Met reacted to the protest, I've found myself looking at the police in a different way.
'I fell much less safe walking around at night. The police are supposed to be there to protect us, but now we have to be wary of them as well.
'It was bad enough before Sarah Everard was murdered but now it's a thousand times worse because who do we go to for help?'
At an vigil on Clapham Common not long after Ms Everard's death, Met were cricised for arresting women at the demonstration.
Angela Nabong, 49, from West Norwood in south London, said: 'I do trust the police because I know the majority are there to help, but I do find myself feeling less safe and I take more precautions when I'm on my own at night.'
Other women said they still have faith in officers but believe the Met Police bosses need to do more to change the institution's attitudes.
Olivia Lesscombe, 41, from Balham, south London, said: 'It's tough because the police have a really hard job to do.
'They have to carry out all the right checks but what can they do if someone lies to them?
'I feel like the majority of officers are trustworthy, but they do have a problem with how they are perceived by the public at the moment. I hope it can be resolved because it can't go on like this.'
Shazza Shah, 29, from Tooting, said: 'It's not that I don't trust the police. He [Couzens] was just one officer, I wouldn't distrust the whole of the police because of one horrendous incident.
'Yes, there have been mistakes, but overall I still mostly trust the police.'
Jackie Corbett, 58, of Tooting Bec, added: 'I think as a whole the police can be trusted, we have to have faith the majority of officers are good people, trying to do their best.
'You get bad people in every job, but the police are more noticeable when one does something awful.
'They have a great access to people and have a lot of power, so it is so terrible if that is used to commit a crime.
'But generally I think the individual officers are doing the job because they want to help people.'
Couzens abducted and murdered Ms Everard as she walked from Clapham Common towards Brixton, using his warant to stop and talk to her.
In the wake of his conviction, questions were raised over why allegations of indecent exposure wee not investigated or flagged up when he moved to work as an armed protection officer.
Today's recruitment stand was placed around two and a half miles from the scene of the 33-year-old marketing executive's dissappearance.
Leaflets handed out by staff today state the vetting process will look into applicants' finances, family ties and any criminal history.
Their identity, social media accounts and address are also checked out.
A criminal conviction or caution will not automatically bar someone from joining, but prison time is likely to halt the application.
Investigators would have to look into the type of conviction, when it was committed and if it showed a 'pattern of behaviour'.
People who are bankrupt and have been given a County Court Judgement are also likely to be barred, the documents state.
Danielle Macken, from Norbury, added: 'I think its important that the police are out in the community talking to people about the process.
'I think it needs to be transparent and hopefully they'll get some good feedback to take back with them because there's a lot of bad feeling in the community.
'There needs to be better engagement between the police and the public because there's a big divide right now.'
According to one officer manning the stand, the Met is hiring some 6,000 new officers as part of the recruitment drive.
Leaflets about the new Police Degree Apprenticeship (PCDA) were also being handed out.
It details the three-year programme in which rookie cops can earn around £30,000 a year and patrol the streets from day one of the course.
The only requirement to join the degree course is GCSE C grade or above in English and Maths.",-2
116,"Secret plans are reportedly being drawn up which will see Covid jabs being rolled out to children as young as five in the coming months.
Leaked proposals suggest health bosses are preparing to jab children aged between five and 11 next spring. 
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said 'expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness' must be met before vaccines would be authorised for children in this age category. 
It is feared that Covid will continue to pose a threat until 2024, meaning health officials are considering new ways to protect Brits.
Speaking earlier this week, England's chief medical officer Christ Whitty said that vaccinating any children as young as five in the UK was a long way off. 
Professor Whitty pointed out that the UK's medicines watchdog hasn't even examined data on the jabs for under-11s.
And a decision on rolling out the vaccine to younger cohorts would depend on the evidence presented to the UK's top scientists, he said at a press conference.
But leaked proposals suggest that the NHS are preparing a scheme to offer immunisations to children aged between five and 11 in the Spring, in the event that regulator approval is granted, according to The Sun. 
A senior source told the publication: 'Top secret plans reveal what is at stake if we are to achieve a meaningful victory over Covid. Asking parents for permission to jab kids as young as five is in the schedule.
'It is controversial, but will help us reach our goal.'
The source added that the plans are still open to change, but that many scientists support the idea of jabbing young children. 
Commenting on the plans, an NHS spokesperson said: 'The NHS regularly plans for how it would operationalise opening vaccines to more people so it is ready to extend the jab quickly when and if any decision is recommended by the JCVI.' 
Before any rollout can be announced for children of this age, the vaccines would need to be approved for use on this age group by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
Additionally, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also needs to approve the rollout. 
At present, vaccines are not being offered to any child younger than the age of 12. 
While US health officials gave the final sign-off to the Pfizer vaccine for use in five to 11-year-olds at the beginning of November, with doses to be administered at a third of the amount given to teenagers and adults. 
And earlier this week, the JCVI recommended that children should wait at least 12 weeks after catching Covid to get their jab.
The body said there is evidence the longer gap reduces the risk of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation reported in a small number of children after vaccination.
Today's change to the guidance only applies to healthy children aged 12 to 17, who previously only had to wait a month after infection to get jabbed.
The four-week gap remains the advice for adults over the age of 18 and children extremely vulnerable to Covid.
Twelve to 15-year-olds are still being offered just one dose of Pfizer's vaccine while officials monitor myocarditis rates in other countries.
But as of this week, 16 and 17-year-olds can now come forward for the second jab after the UK's regulator decided the benefit of the jabs 'clearly' outweighed the risk. 
Speaking about the leaked plans, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'COVID-19 vaccines have not been approved by our independent medicines regulator, the MHRA, for under-12s so are not used in the UK.' 
And Professor Chris Whitty called for calm this week over suggestions that the Covid jabs could soon be offered to under-11s.
He said: 'We haven't yet even got a licence with MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency] so let's not rush our fences on this.
'It will depend entirely on the data that are presented to the independent regulator and the independent scientific advisory committee.'
The MHRA has not yet made a decision on whether to offer younger groups the vaccine, because it has not yet examined data from the US, which is already administering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds.
The agency examines all clinical trial and safety data from Covid vaccine makers that apply for a license in the UK before making a decision on whether the jab is safe and effective for a certain age group.
The JCVI then advises No10 on whether that cohort should be given the injections as part of the vaccine rollout after weighing up the benefits and risks.
The group advised ministers against jabbing 12 to 15-year-olds because children face such a tiny threat from Covid.
It also warned about the risk from a rare vaccine side effect called myocarditis, which can cause heart damage. 
Critics say children are better off catching the virus and getting protection naturally because the risk of being admitted to ICU is about one in 500,000.
But the JCVI panel — who only looked at a rigid set of criteria — recommended the UK's chief medical officers were given the final say.
Professor Chris Whitty and colleagues ultimately decided to recommend jabs to 12-15 year olds because modelling showed it would prevent thousands from having to take time off school.
Professor Jeremy Brown, a member of the JCVI, said earlier this month that it is 'far too early' to say whether it will recommend vaccinating children aged under-12.
But he said there is 'a case for using a vaccine on those children that have underlying diseases that make them more vulnerable' to the virus. 
And Professor Jonathan Van-Tam Professor, England's deputy chief medical officer, said the JCVI 'will be considering' whether to follow the US in expanding the rollout to over-fives. But the decision is 'some way down the tracks', he added. 
By Connor Boyd Deputy Health Editor for MailOnline
Children should wait at least 12 weeks after catching Covid to get their jab, Britain's vaccine advisory panel recommended today.   
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said there is evidence the longer gap reduces the risk of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation reported in a small number of children after vaccination.
Today's change to the guidance only applies to healthy children aged 12 to 17, who previously only had to wait a month after infection to get jabbed.
The four-week gap remains the advice for adults over the age of 18 and children extremely vulnerable to Covid.
Twelve to 15-year-olds are still being offered just one dose of Pfizer's vaccine while officials monitor myocarditis rates in other countries.
But as of this week, 16 and 17-year-olds can now come forward for the second jab after the UK's regulator decided the benefit of the jabs 'clearly' outweighed the risk. 
So far, more than half of older teenagers have come forward for a first dose and nearly a third of 12 to 15-year-olds have had the initial jab. 
Families who have recently had a child vaccinated shortly after infection were told not to worry, and that the new approach is 'highly precautionary'.
The UK Health Security Agency, which announced the move today, admitted that it would slow down the rollout of the national vaccine programme. 
But it insisted it should not have a major impact on the epidemic because children still have high levels of natural immunity.
The UKHSA estimates half of secondary-aged pupils have already had the virus. 
Covid immunity wanes within six months of Pfizer's second vaccine no matter how old you are, a study has found as the NHS gears up to roll out annual boosters at a cost in the region of £1billion to taxpayers.
People who finished their two-dose course in January had a 51 per cent increased risk of catching the virus by July than those who were jabbed later, according to the research on more than a million Israelis.
Scientists claimed the increased risk of getting infected was visible among people of all ages, although the elderly remain face much higher odds of becoming severely ill. 
The study —  by Israeli researchers using medial data from 1.3million adults in the country — is the first to confirm that younger people also see their immunity against the virus wane within months. There was hope that protection would hold-up better in younger groups because they typically have stronger immune systems.
Israel, which has led the charge on vaccines throughout the pandemic, is already offering boosters to over-16s so long as five months have passed since their second dose. The researchers said it was too early to tell how quickly immunity wanes after a booster jab but it could last longer.
In the UK, top-up doses were approved for all over-50s, health and care home workers and severely ill patients in September and ministers expanded the programme to people in their forties this week.
Vaccine advisers in Britain have admitted that they could be given to younger adults but they are waiting on more conclusive evidence on their safety and efficacy. 
The agency, which replaced Public Health England last month, said natural infection provided good protection against re-infection for three to six months.
A major study in Israel today found that protection from two doses of Pfizer's vaccine lasts a similar length of time. Immunity from a single dose, however, wanes more quickly. 
Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at UKHSA, said: 'The Covid vaccines are very safe. 
'Based on a highly precautionary approach, we are advising a longer interval between Covid infection and vaccination for those aged under 18. 
'This increase is based on the latest reports from the UK and other countries, which may suggest that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination will further reduce the already very small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups.
'Young people and parents should be reassured that myocarditis is extremely rare, at whatever point they take up the vaccine, and this change has been made based on the utmost precaution.'
'We keep all advice under constant review and will revise it according to the latest data and evidence.'
UK Government data justifying today's update shows nine in every million under-18s in the UK will get myocarditis after a single dose of Pfizer's Covid jab, the same as around one per 110,000. 
But for every million doses of the vaccine administered to children, they will prevent around 150 hospitalisations from Covid.
The JCVI held off on recommending second doses for children because data from Israel and the US suggested the myocarditis risk is as high as one in 10,000.  
But real-world UK data in slightly older adults - who also saw above normal rates of myocarditis in other countries - was not higher after the second jab.
This is thought to be because the dosing gap between doses here is 12 weeks, whereas it's between three and four weeks in the US and Israel. 
The JCVI believes that 12-week gap might also be the sweet spot for getting a jab after natural infection in young people, which prompted today's tweak to the guidance. 
There is also evidence that rates of myocarditis in Britain are similar in 16 and 17-year-olds and 18 to 29-year-olds, after the second jab.
This is why the JCVI recommend two jabs for healthy older teens earlier this week. But it is still weighing up the evidence on younger children. 
It is unclear why the longer space between vaccination or natural infection reduces the risk of myocarditis yet. 
This gap might give the immune system time to calm down from the reaction to the first dose or infection.  
During Covid infection or immunisation, the body produces cells to fight the virus. If the disease-fighting cells enter the heart, they can inflame the muscle. ",-2
117,"A Virginia cop who was fired for anonymously donating $25 to a Kyle Rittenhouse defense fund after being outed by hackers and the media is now demanding his job back from the woke, 'hypocrite' police chief who fired him. 
Speaking to DailyMail.com on Friday, as the Rittenhouse verdict came in on Friday, Norfolk Police Lieutenant William 'Bill' Kelly explained why he thought Rittenhouse deserved his help back then, and why he stands by the decision now. 
Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all counts on Friday after a two week trial. He buckled in tears as the verdict was read aloud and is now a free man. 
Seven months ago, long before the trial had even started, 42-year-old Kelly was fired for donating anonymously to the teenager's then-growing defense fund.  
Kelly, a 19-year veteran and father-of-three who had moved into the internal affairs division at the time, made a $25 donation to a Give Send Go online campaign for Rittenhouse's legal team after watching social media videos and journalists' footage from the August 2020 Kenosha riots. 
He wrote alongside his donation: 'God Bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You’ve done nothing wrong. Every rank-and-file police officer supports you.'

He thought nothing else of it, until his name appeared in an article by The Guardian among the names of other cops who gave to the fund. Their details had been hacked by a group and provided to the media. Kelly was fired and vilified by the police chief and city manager in Norfolk, who called his actions 'egregious'.  
In an interview with DailyMail.com, he explained why he thought Rittenhouse was innocent from the beginning. 
'Everything I'm saying is just my personal opinion. I've been a homicide detective, a violent crimes investigator for years. I have a background. I watched the video of the shooting and I'd seen the video of the journalists of Mr. Rittenhouse before the shooting and the protesters before the shooting and I thought it painted a pretty clear picture that Mr. Rittenhouse had a very strong claim for self-defense.
'I was very surprised when he was charged soon after the shooting with these murders and the shooting of the third victim,' he said. 
Kelly, a self-confessed 'news junkie', saw that a GoFundMe account for Rittenhouse had been canceled, and a site called Give Send Go had set up another page for him. 
He logged on and donated, making sure to leave out personal details because he says he didn't want to associate himself with the police department. 
'I was interested in giving him the chance to defend himself in front of a jury. I know that lawyers are expensive, and it's hard sometimes to get the message out there. I wanted to make sure that he had the means necessary to make his claim in court.
'It mattered. The comments I made, my belief that he has a strong claim for self-defense was a personal opinion. I didn't want my city or police department to be associated with it, so I chose to donate anonymously.
'It was only after the hackers broke into it that they were able to connect those dots,' he said. 
A hacker group called 'Distributed Denial of Secrets' obtained his name and email address from the fund and provided it to The Guardian, which published a story including his name. The Daily Dot followed. 
Within a day of it coming out, the Norfolk Police Department was receiving widespread calls to fire Kelly from all over the world. 
'It wasn't people local, it was people from all around the country who read an article and sent a nasty tweet. In the absence of that outcry, there would not have been any kind of disciplinary action against me, I'm confident,' he said. 
The city decided that the comments 'eroded' the public's trust in the police and Kelly was fired in April. 
He has since filed a grievance, but the process is ongoing and in the meantime, he's had to survive on his savings. 
Speaking from his home in Norfolk, he said he wishes the city officials had waited at least until tensions surrounding the case had calmed, if not until the trial. 
'If people consumed as much information as I did about the case they may have come to a different conclusion. And honestly even if they did consume as much information as I did and they came to a different conclusion - that's fine. 
'This is America. You can agree with your neighbors and other people in your community and you can disagree with them. Just because someone has a different opinion than you, it doesn't mean you should destroy their lives, take their job away.
'My opinion on the self-defense claim of Mr. Rittenhouse has no impact on my ability to do my job as a police officer.'
He says the only reason he was fired was because he supported the teenager. 
'If I had a different opinion and I donated to a fund for the victims and made comments about how Mr. Rittenhouse was a murderer, nobody would have cared or tried to get me fired.'
In his grievance, he points to the fact that the police chief Larry Boone attended a BLM protest in May last year in full uniform, while on duty. 
In the photo, Boone is holding a sign that reads Black Lives Matter, with the names of people who have been shot by cops - including some in Norfolk - around it. 
'The hypocrisy is dumbfounding. For the leader of our organization to be able to advocate support for a movement that is at the very least divisive in America today, in uniform while on duty... he was holding carried the name of a person who had recently been shot by a Norfolk police officer. 
'The sign demanded justice for that person, but that shooting was still under investigation to determine whether or not that officer should be charged criminally. It's very inconsistent.
'Yet I cannot, off-duty, on my own time make a donation and some comments that are well within the realm of public, acceptable discourse?' 
The bigger issue, he says, is that he was fired for daring to have an opinion that went against woke officials and public pressure to condemn the teenager.  
 'The outcome of the trial has nothing to do with my vindication - right or wrong, an American has the right to express their opinion within the realm of public discourse. 
'That same freedom exists regardless to the outcome.' 
Now, he says the censorship of right-wing political views is 'chilling' police officers all over the country.
They feel 'disposable' unless they submit to a liberal ideology. 
'It made me feel disposable. Not only how it affected me, how it affected other officers. I was contacted by others who said they immediately deleted their social  media accounts after I got fired out of fear that they would go through them and find something innocuous to use against them.
'I've been contacted by officers who say, ""what if Trump runs in 2024 and I put a sign for him in my front yard, can media get a hold of that? If enough people complain, will I lose my job?""
'The effects of this kind of censorship are wide. It ripples through the entire department. It's a chilling effect.'
Kelly and his wife have been surviving on her salary as a school teacher and his savings to get by, but he is hoping he will be reinstated soon and given backpay. 
The couple have three kids, the oldest of whom is 18. 
He is desperate to return to work and was just ten months away from vesting for his pension when he was fired. If he doesn't get his job back, he'll lose the pension he worked almost 20 years for. 
'I love being a cop, it's a part of me and who I am. It was a huge hit to me to lose my  job. If I got the chance again, I'd jump on it,' he said. 
Kelly said that even though Rittenhouse has now been acquitted, he does not believe public discourse will change because people have 'dug in' to their opinions. 
'I don't think the discourse will change. People are dug in on their heels... they'll point to some other boogie-man as an excuse as to why he was acquitted. They won't be forced to look at the facts of the case. I don't think they'll change their mind.
'Honestly, most of America is pretty polarized. People on both sides who seem to be ideologically dug in to their position.
'They try to view fact patterns through it and it's hard to break free from it,' he said. 
The City of Norfolk did not respond to inquiries about whether it intended to give him his job back. 
He is hoping for a hearing date at the end of January, but wants to resolve the issue privately before then.    ",-2
118,"A new zebra crossing which lights up as pedestrians approach it is the first in the UK.
The innovative new concept in Portsmouth, Hampshire has LED panels installed in the road surface and illuminates as pedestrians walk towards it.
It was developed to make zebra crossings safer as it makes pedestrians more visible to approaching drivers at night.
The new crossing system will be monitored and the concept could be replicated across other parts of the city if it's successful.  
Portsmouth City Council's cabinet member for traffic and transportation, Councillor Lynne Stagg, said: 'We are always looking for new ways to improve road safety and I'm delighted we're the first place in the UK to use this innovative new technology.
'We chose this crossing because it's very busy particularly at night with all the nearby bars and restaurants, we want to make the crossing more visible and encourage more people to cross there safely.
'We always tell people to make themselves as visible as possible, it's a really simple way to improve safety and lighting up this crossing is a great example of how that can work.'
Road contractor Colas developed the lighting system, which worked with the local council and the Department of Transport.
TIan Gibson, director of asset contracting at Colas, said: 'It is a first in the UK and we are looking forward to sharing the results of this trial within the industry.'",-2
119,"CCTV captured the shocking moment a boxing promotor dodged death by inches after a speeding driver crashed into his car at 80mph a split second after he got out of the way.
Footage on CCTV shows boxing promotor Andy Booker jumping into his parked car as a manic driver slams into his car.  
The crash happened on 6.45 pm on Wednesday night in Askern, Doncaster in South Yorkshire.
In the video, the speeding driver hits an oncoming white van before hitting Mr Booker's parked car and the boxing promoter darts into his car just in time. 
Mr Booker's car lights flash while the other driver hits a wall further down Moss Road.
Both cars are then filmed wrecked at the scene after the crash.
Mr Booker, who says he is friends with former World Heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, said: 'Well that was close I just managed to get in my car as he hit me at about 80 miles an hour or he would have gone straight over me.
'Cop said a split second and it would have been a different ending.
'It was so close I only just managed to get in my car.' 
A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said they received a call to report that a car believed to have been used in an earlier assault was in collision with another car before veering into a wall further down Moss Road.
They said: 'The occupants all fled on foot before officers arrived.
'They are described to have been wearing dark clothing and approximately five foot 11 in height.
'Two of the occupants were seen fleeing down Marlborough Road.
'Enquiries at both scenes continue at this time.'
Police are asking anyone in the area at the time who saw or hear anything suspicious or who has dash cam or CCTV footage which may have caught the incident which could assist with enquiries to call 101, quoting 774 of November 17.",-2
120,"There was a significant rise in the number of bodies left undiscovered at home for at least a week, in the first year of the pandemic, a study has suggested. 
Post-mortems on 'markedly decomposed' bodies in the UK increased by 70 per cent during the pandemic.
Researchers compared data from the 12 months before and after the implementation of the first national lockdown on March 23, 2020.
Every severely decomposed body found at home was someone who live alone, the study by Imperial College's Healthcare Trust has said in their paper.
The findings, published in the Clinical Pathology journal, said that the rise meant tha tmany loved ones were left without substantive answers over causes of death - including potential genetic diseases.
The study found that 29 of the 104 post-mortems analysed between March 2020 and March 2021 showed marked decomposition (27.9 per cent).
Of the 159 post-mortems between March 2019 and March 2020 which were examined, only 26 showed this decomposition (16.4 per cent).
Covid restrictions imposed for the first time in March 2020 meant that household mixing was significantly reduced.
The study also found that 38 per cent more deaths in the 2020/21 sample were from home, reflecting the 'stay at home' restrictions which were in places for months during the year.
Co-author of the study, Dr Theodore Estrin-Serlui told The Telegraph: 'This excess in severe decomposition following death is generally a sign of the body not being found for a long time, in excess of at least a week.'
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said that more than 60,000 extra deaths have occurred in private homes since the start of the Covid pandemic.
A report published found that there have been 252,486 deaths in private homes between January 2020 and June 2021.
The number of deaths at home in the England and Wales has steadily risen since 2005, with thousands more people choosing to die in the comfort of their home rather than a hospital bed.
But the proportion leapt nearly 30 per cent in 2020 compared to the year before, as Britons were told to 'stay home, protect the NHS, save lives' when Covid struck.
The ONS data shows there were about 41,000 more at-home deaths from all reasons in 2020 compared to 2019, with the number of people dying at home peaking in May.
However, figures for 2021, which go up to June, show there were nearly 25,000 more deaths at home than the five-year-average for this period, casting doubt over lockdown being the sole reason for the rise. 
Dr Sam Royston, director of policy and research at Marie Curie, told the Telegraph: 'The pandemic has been a stress test for how well our health and care system works for people dying at home.
'And this data clearly shows a system failing people when they are most in need.'
 A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman sent condolences to those affected by the loss.
They added: 'We are incredibly grateful to NHS staff, including district and community nurses and volunteers, who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to deliver palliative and end-of-life care to people at the most difficult time of their lives'. 
There has been serious debate over the merit of the lockdowns and if they did more harm than good for the nation's health with it leading to people avoiding seeking medical help out of fear of the virus and disrupted tests and scans for illnesses such as cancer.
Experts have called for further and more detailed research to determine if people are choosing to die at home, or if they being left to suffer by a system unable to to provide them quality care of their final days.
The biggest at-home killer was heart disease, killing more than 25,000 people in 2020 alone. Covid has only played a comparatively minor role in deaths at home, killing around 3,000. 
The study recorded most of the deaths that took place in the London borough of Westminster or the borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
Researchers have said the mixed demographics of the study - with some of the most wealthy living alongside some of the most deprived in these areas - mean the study is 'fairly representative of the UK as a whole'.
'Our study's information has important ramifications for the autopsy process, as bodies with significant decomposition changes are less likely to provide reliable, accurate causes of death due to the degradation of tissue and toxicology,' the authors added.
'This can lead to bereaved families having more uncertainty regarding the death of a loved one.'",-2
121,"A man is fighting for his life in hospital with a head injury which police believe he may have sustained in an attack after a Queens Park Rangers football match.
The 52-year-old was found after the match last night against Luton Town.
He was found at around 9.50pm on Friday, near the Uxbridge Road junction with Davenport Road in west London. 
Police said they think he may have been caught up in disorder or assaulted after the Championship match and have appealed for witnesses.
Witnesses on social media suggested the post-match fracas happened as fans left the stadium.  
The man, from Luton, was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service (LAS) paramedics and is in a life-threatening condition.  
Social media users tweeted about the disorder last night and expressed their sadness about the fights that had broken out. 
Metropolitan Police Detective Constable Arrash Faghihi said the incident happened in an 'extremely busy' area and urged any witnesses or anyone with mobile phone footage which may be relevant to contact the force.
He said: 'This man sustained a serious head injury, and it is vital that we make contact with witnesses quickly.
'The area was extremely busy after the match and there will undoubtedly be many people with information that will assist police.
'I need them to get in touch as detectives work to build a complete picture of what happened on Friday night.'
No arrests have been made. Anyone with information and any witnesses should call 101, ref 7888/19nov, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",-2
122,"A Nasa engineer has claimed she has applied for part-time jobs at Tiffany & Co and Apple due to the rising cost of living in the US. 
The engineer, a TikTok user called Kelly, from Houston, Texas, whose username is @sexybabypartygirl, has filmed her interview experience with Tiffany & Co on the app.
Her video began: 'I am a Nasa engineer and I'm applying for a job at Tiffany, part-time. And I have my interview in 40 minutes.'  
Preparing for her interview, she showed the outfit she had picked for the interview.
She chose a black dress and heels which she hoped was 'on-brand' for the interview and then said the location of the jewellery store was in the Galleria mall in Houston.  
The Nasa engineer showed some footage from inside Tiffany and said she got the job at the store, revealing she would be working in operations for $20 an hour. 
She then wrote that she has another interview to follow with the Apple store.   
Millions of people have viewed the video, more than 3.1m times and there has been a number of confused people who do not understand why she needs other jobs when she works for Nasa.
One person wrote: 'Soo even Nasa doesn't pay that well?' and another wrote: 'If someone who works at Nasa needs a second job I have no hope for my future.'
Another commenter wrote: 'A Nasa engineer needs a part-time job yet people are still not taking the wage crisis seriously.'  
There were others shocked at the wages Tiffany pay staff, surprised that they were only $20 an hour. 
Kelly revealed that she was taking on more jobs to make more money so that she could go back to see her family in Wisconsin more often.  
Another video then addressed some of the comments that the Nasa engineer had from viewers.
She said she enjoys her job at Nasa and she is paid well but she just wanted to make a little bit more money.  
Her video went on to say: 'I'm not looking for a new full-time job, but my rent is high, I have student loans, I have car loans, and I like to thrift a lot.'  
She said the salary for Tiffany & Co is 'really good for a part-time job in Texas' and then asked her followers what part-time jobs would pay better.   
The video concluded with an answer to a question about the education path she had taken to become a Nasa engineer. 
She revealed she had a degree in chemical engineering from Wisconsin but would not recommend it. 
Viewers were again concerned by her follow-up video, one said that capitalism had failed when a person who helps with space missions had to get a second job.  
Others were genuinely shocked by the pay of Nasa engineers, which according to ZipRecruiter on average is $87,880 for an employee in Houston, Texas but nationally it is $95,114 per year.  
There were people who appreciated the Nasa engineers 'normalisation' of working second jobs to afford the lifestyle she has.   
The TikTok user decided to decline the job offer from Tiffany and then explained she had started to work for Nasa when she was 20 after she had applied via a company intern program.   
Another person asked what Nasa is looking for from employees and she said people who are smart, well-rounded and decent with good social skills are a nice fit for the company.  
She said she had been offered the Apple job after having three interviews with them and would work as a technical specialist for them.  
Her video expressed her excitement and she said she was looking forward to using her Apple employee discount. 
She ended by saying she will not be leaving her job at Nasa and has taken on the part-time job for the money so she can 'do more fun things.'
A technical specialist for Apple in Texas makes $16-19 an hour, according to Glassdoor.
Kelly was contacted for comment.  ",-2
123,"NASA and the U.S. government are looking for proposals on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon with the goal of having energy on the moon that's not reliant on the sun by the end of the decade.
NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory formally put out a request for proposals from the public on Friday for a fission surface power system. 
In a collaboration between NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab, the two agencies are specifically looking to establish a source of power that does not rely on the sun or solar power for missions on the moon.
'Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,' Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. 
Should the lunar nuclear reactors be a success in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next stop would be Mars, according to the world's leading space agency.
NASA states that such fission surface power could likely provide long-term power for human lunar colonies, regardless of environmental conditions. 
'I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,' Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement.  
The reactor itself would be built on earth before being sent to the moon.
For those who wish to send a proposal, NASA says submitted plans for the fission surface power system will need to include a uranium-fueled reactor core, a thermal management system to keep the reactor at the proper temperature, a system to convert the nuclear power into usable energy, and a distribution system that provides no less than 40 kilowatts of electric power. 
Said power system proposals will need to supply continuous power for 10 years in the lunar environment.
The reactor must also be capable of turning itself on and off without human oversight, that it can operate from a lunar lander deck, and that it is mobile enough to be transported from the lander to a different lunar site for operation if necessary. 
Successful proposals for the reactor must weigh no more than 13,200 pounds, and be able to fit inside a 12-foot diameter cylinder that's 18 feet long when launched from earth to the moon. 
The deadline for proposal requests for an initial system design must be submitted by February 19, the outlet reports.  
This is not the first collaborative project between NASA and the Idaho National Laboratory, with the lab most recently helping build a radioisotope power system for the space agency's Mar's rover Perseverance, which converts heat that's generated from the decay or plutonium-238 into electrical power.
The rover landed on the Martian surface back in February and has remained active on the red planet ever since.  
The Energy Department has also recently been looking for private businesses to collaborate with on various nuclear power plans, most notably a new generation of smaller power plants ranging from small modular rectors to small mobile reactors that can quickly be set up in the field and be removed when no longer needed. ",-2
124,"A woman who suffered eight cardiac arrests while hospitalised with Covid after refusing the vaccine has now urged others to get the jab.
Gemma Roberts, 35, had to be revived eight times by medical staff at Warrington Hospital after her heart stopped multiple times. 
On August 11 of this year, she was rushed to hospital and placed on a ventilator after contracting coronavirus. 
The former Eddie Stobart employee told The Mirror that after initially being rushed to hospital, she pleaded with doctors not to let her die and that she rang her partner Sophie to tell her she was being put to sleep. 
She said: 'I wish I had the vaccine before, I think everyone should have it now.
'I was one of those people that was scared of having the jab. I heard it had killed people.
'I took a chance and I almost didn't pull through. Medical professionals saved my life, that's who I will listen to now.'
She added that she felt guilty for having put her family through such stress.
During her time in hospital, Gemma also contracted sepsis twice, which partner Sophie Holmes, 39, said caused a large rash to appear. 
Gemma initially tested positive for Covid-19 after taking a lateral flow test, followed by a PCR test.
She said she thought she was just hungover following a wedding party the weekend before because she had been feeling tired, sick and out of breath.
After her positive tests, she was told she would be taken to hospital so medical personnel could administer her with oxygen before letting her go again. 
Partner Sophie said that she was told two days after being admitted to hospital that she was going to be put to sleep - before she suffered cardiac arrest on August 14. 
She was brought back by medical staff before suffering a further two in the following days.
Then, on August 31 she suffered four cardiac arrests on a single day after having been on a ventilator for three weeks.
One more cardiac arrest followed, and she was eventually taken off of a ventilator at the beginning of October.
However, upon waking up, she discovered that she couldn't move her arms or legs.
She has since worked with physio staff to allow her to walk again with the use of a walking aid - and Sophie even proposed. ",-2
125,"The White House's communications chief of staff has announced she is leaving her post, marking the administration's second high-profile resignation this week as President Biden's approval ratings continue to plummet. 
White House communications chief of staff Emma Riley said Friday she is resigning from her Oval Office gig less than a year into the administration and is heading to a new post at the Labor Department. 
'It was an honor and privilege to serve @POTUS and the American people at the @White House … I'm excited to be moving down Pennsylvania Ave and traveling around the country with @SecMartyWalsh and @USDOL,' Riley tweeted.
Riley's announcement comes one day after Kamala Harris' communications director Ashley Etienne announced she is leaving the vice president's office, after reports that staff are in-fighting and her boss is being sidelined. 
Etienne, a former staffer to Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, joined Harris' team shortly after the election and said at the time she would only stay a year. 
Etienne is set to leave in December to pursue other opportunities, the White House said.
'Ashley is valued member of the Vice President’s team, who has worked tirelessly to advance the goals of this administration. She is leaving the office in December to pursue other opportunities,' a White House official told DailyMail.com.
Etienne's departure comes as her soon-to-be former boss has taken a beating in recent weeks with a series of unflattering stories about her role as vice president, in-fighting among her staff, and complaints from her allies the Biden administration is not properly utilizing her.
Harris has denied those claims, saying she doesn't feel like she's being underutilized by President Joe Biden and his team.
'No. I don't,' she said when asked this week if she feels she's being underutilized.
'I am very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished but I am also absolutely, absolutely clear-eyed that there is a lot more to do and we're going to get it done,' Harris told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired on Good Morning America Thursday morning.
Harris' boss has not fared much better, however, as Biden's approval rating dropped to 36 percent in a new poll released this week that said most voters want to see Republicans take control of Congress.
The new numbers - from a Quinnipiac University poll - indicate a level of frustration among voters with the party in power as the country prepares for next year's midterm elections.
Only 36 percent of those polled approve of the job President Biden is doing while 53 percent disapprove. It's the lowest job approval rating he's received in a Quinnipiac University poll. 
In the survey, 46 percent said they want to see Republicans win control of the House - compared to 38 percent who want Democrats - and 46 percent want the GOP in the charge of the Senate, compared to 40 percent who favor Democrats.
Independent voters, who typically decide matters in elections, also want to see Republicans in charge of Congress: 41 percent to 31 percent for the House, respectively, and 44 percent to 34 percent for the Senate.
Additionally, a slight majority of Americans - 52 percent - said the Democratic Party has moved to the left.
Historically, the president's political party tends to do badly in the first midterms after they take office. Both Barack Obama and Donald Trump saw their respective parties lose control of the House of Representatives in their first midterms - 2010 and 2018, respectively.",-2
126,"A large fire broke out in a building on an iconic street in Central Paris this morning near the Place de L'Opera square.  
The building on 17 Boulevard des Capucines erupted into flames and sent clouds of smoke rising into the air. 
It started in an office at 10.30am, on the third floor of the seven-floor building.
The building is situated between the 2nd and 9th arrondissement of Paris and above a Bennetton store, Rossignol and a Five Guys.
The iconic opera house Palais Garnier is some 984 feet away from the building and  100 firefighters desperately worked to stop the inferno spreading. 
Crews brought the fire under control at midday and there were no reported deaths or injuries following the blaze.    
Place de L'Opera was closed along with the nearby metro station.
The cause of the fire has not yet been established.  
Firefighters were also seen dealing with the inferno on the second floor of the building.  
The fire hit the 3rd floor of the building and a little of the 4th floor and there is housing on the last two floors of the block.
Earlier, a drone was also deployed to survey the extent of the damage to the building from the air. 
According to Le Figaro , an investigation will happen to determine the cause of the fire.
Social media users took to Twitter to share videos of the ferocious blaze as it first took hold.
Pictures and videos were also circulated as firefighters began to bring the blaze under control and worked to stop it spreading.
Some shared their sadness over the fire, with one person tweeting: 'Triste triste' (sad, sad).
Others shared videos of the beginning of the fire, saying it was a 'strange morning.' 
Boulevard des Capucines is one of the 'Grands Boulevards' in Paris. 
The name comes from the convent of Capuchin nuns and the road houses some of the most iconic buildings in Paris. 
The fire comes two days after Thursday's fire at Palais Vivienne in Paris which started in the kitchens of an Asian restaurant on the ground floor.
No injuries were reported and the fire was dealt with.
The owner, Pierre--Jean Chalençon was evacuated safely from the building.",-2
127,"Bill Maher has dared House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to appear on his HBO talk show.
The Real Time host also scolded the far-left ‘Squad’ member on Friday for dismissing critics of ‘wokeness’ - which he claims is the reason Democrats suffered electoral defeats this year in Virginia and elsewhere.
Maher said he would 'love' to have Ocasio-Cortez on his show since there's 'so much to admire' about her, particularly her efforts to combat climate change.
'But that will probably never happen because Democrats don't go anywhere these days where they're not being adored,' Maher said.
'And that's my last bit of advice to them. Go where the ""amen corner"" isn't.
'Do Fox News. Be brave. Come here. Go everywhere.'
Maher added: 'Winning is about expanding the electorate.'
DailyMail.com has reached out to a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez seeking reaction to Maher's comments. 
The HBO talker also hit out at Ocasio-Cortez and the Democratic Party for turning ‘woke’ into a ‘pejorative’ that has turned off voters.
'If the word only made you think of rational, deserved causes like teaching a less whitewashed version of American history, AOC would still want to own it,' Maher said.
'But it's a joke because it makes you think of people who wake up offended and take orders from Twitter.
'And their oversensitivity has grown tiresome.'
In his monologue on Friday’s show, Maher mentioned that Ocasio-Cortez rejected criticism from political strategist James Carville that Democrats’ touting of ‘stupid wokeness’ hurt them at the polling stations.
The congresswoman from Queens and the Bronx tweeted earlier this month that the term ‘woke’ was primarily used by ‘older people.’
'Like the average audience for people seriously using the word ​""​woke""​ in a 2021 political discussion are James Carville and Fox News pundits so that should tell you all you need to know​,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted earlier this month.
She hit out at Carville, a former top adviser to Bill Clinton, tweeting: ‘​And before people disingenuously complain “woke” is denigrating to older people, it’s actually pundits like Carville using terms like “woke” to insult voters under 45 that’s denigrating.’
She added: '​Don’t wonder why youth turnout falls when Dems talk about them like this. We need everyone​.'
Ocasio-Cortez was reacting to an interview that Carville gave to PBS News House to discuss Republican Glen Youngkin's victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia gubernatorial race.
Republicans also captured the state legislature in Virginia, which had previously been led by a Democrat majority.
The election in Virginia and other races nationwide this year has political observers predicting that the GOP will take back the House and the Senate next year.
'What?!' Maher said, reacting to Ocasio-Cortez's criticism of Carville.
'This is a term folks like you brought out very recently, had been proudly displaying it every march since.
'Just last year, The Guardian declared ""woke"" the ""word of our era.""
'I guess they didn't get the memo from the Mean Girls Club.'
Maher continued: 'What a great strategy, never missing an opportunity to remind voters how lame and clueless and hopelessly cool they are, especially since those are the ones who actually vote.
'But OK, fine. What word would you like us to use for the plainly insane excesses of the left that are not liberalism but something completely different?
'Because you can't have that word ""liberal"" from us and think it should cover things like canceling Lincoln.
'And teaching third-graders they're oppressors. That's all your new-think.'
Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats' so-called 'woke problem' was 'made up' to try and push the left away from fighting for racial injustice and election reform, which she claims could help them win.
'One dangerous aspect of thinking there's a 'woke problem' is that Dem chances for re-election or majorities in House, Senate , & WH rely on the racial justice issue of voting rights,' the New York representative tweeted earlier this month.
She added: 'Dems distancing from racial justice makes protection of voting rights less likely, ensuring losses.'
Republicans and establishment Democrats claimed that the party's embracing a more progressive agenda and going 'woke' contributed to the wave of defeats in this month's election.
She said that the term 'woke' is a way for the GOP to launch attacks and deflect from civil rights advancements – such as the teaching of Critical Race Theory in schools that became a central issue to the Virginia gubernatorial election.
'Woke' is a term pundits are now using as a derogatory euphemism for civil rights & justice,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
'Making up a 'woke' problem results in putting civil & voting rights on the backburner,' she continued.
'In a year state legislatures are planning out GOP majorities & voter suppression, that's dangerous.'
'People think Fox News is just about indoctrinating right-wingers, but it's also about conditioning Dems on what to run away from,' the three-part Twitter thread read.
Carville, who helped steer Bill Clinton to victory in 1992 aimed squarely at cultural clashes over race, education, and police funding as the heart of the matter, after Youngkin took down McAuliffe by winning over suburban areas that had gone for Joe Biden just a year ago.
'What went wrong is just stupid wokeness. Don't just look at Virginia and New Jersey. Look at Long Island, look at Buffalo, look at Minneapolis, even look at Seattle, Washington,' Carville said as he ticked off election results in an appearance on PBS News Hour.
'I mean, this 'defund the police' lunacy, this take Abraham Lincoln's name off of schools. I mean that — people see that,' he said.
He said Terry McAuliffe got 'caught up in something national' and blamed it for his loss (McAuliffe also has deep Clinton ties). 
Earlier this week, Maher appeared on Chris Cuomo's CNN prime time talk show and repeated his criticisms of 'wokeness.'
Maher, who describes himself as an 'old-school liberal', slammed the far left and progressive side of the Democrats which he called the 'party of no common sense'.
He added that he supported teaching the history of racism in America, but 'that's different than teaching children that racism is the essence of America.' 
'That's what people get upset about, or involving children who are not old enough or sophisticated enough to understand this very complicated history.' 
Maher also told Cuomo that he supports Dave Chappelle, who received backlash after making derogatory comments about trans people, and said he himself has received calls to be cancelled from conservatives and liberals alike. 
The late night host warned that Donald Trump would run for re-election in 2022 and further a 'slow-moving coup' take over the GOP with his supporters. 
As they discussed cancel culture and Maher's apparent diversion from liberals, Cuomo asked The Real Time talk show host if he was worried about getting cancelled. 
Maher shrugged the question off because he said 'both sides' have tried cancelling him. 
'My politics have not changed. I'm an old-school liberal. We were talking about the race issue. They changed, not me,' Maher said. 
'I was the old — we should be moving toward a color-blind society where we don't see race. That's the old way to look at it, I think that's still the good way to look at it.' 
Along with decades of criticism from conservatives, Maher has recently received backlash from fellow liberals over his opinions on topics like CRT and cancel culture.        ",-2
128,"One of Ghislaine Maxwell's accusers had a hand in setting up Tom Parker Bowles in a newspaper cocaine sting in the 90s, it has been reported.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is expected to appear as a witness for the prosecution at Maxwell's trial which is due to start on November 29 and is set to be the trial of the century.
But, according to the Telegraph, it has now come to light that the woman was paid up to £40,000 to help a tabloid newspaper set up Mr Parker Bowles, son of the Duchess of Cornwall, as part of a well-publicized sting in 1999.
The newspaper reports that the incident may be brought up during Maxwell's trial as part of the defence's bid to undermine the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
In the sting, which took place in 1999, Mr Parker Bowles was secretly filmed offering to buy cocaine for the woman, who was used by the tabloid because she knew Mr Parker Bowles at the time. 
He also admitted using cocaine himself with 'someone he found last night' while working in France. 
Mr Parker Bowles, who was 24 at the time and working as a publicist, was caught in the sting while at the Cannes Film Festival and the incident was splashed over five pages of the News of the World. 
In contemporary reports, Parker Bowles was described as 'contrite' while it was said Prince Charles, who was then a patron of the drugs charity Phoenix House, was 'fairly cross' with the 24-year-old and scolded him for having been caught up in the sting. 
The Telegraph also adds that another witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has previously been arrested for possession of cocaine and use of drug paraphernalia.
Ghislaine, a British socialite and daughter of the late Robert Maxwell who is currently in a New York jail, is due to stand trial in the United States in just over a week.
Maxwell, 59, is charged with sex trafficking, with prosecutors claiming she helped pedophile Jeffrey Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately sexually abuse young girls.
She has pleaded not guilty, and the trial is expected to begin on November 29. 
Earlier this month, Maxwell spoke to The Mail on Sunday for the first time about her 'living hell' behind bars – claiming that she has been assaulted and abused by prison guards, purposely deprived of sleep and given rotting food to eat.
Maxwell, who had her $28million (£21M) bail application denied for the fourth time last week, also claimed negative media coverage while she has been in custody and the deliberate withholding of evidence have made it 'impossible' for her to receive a fair trial. ",-2
129,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday appeared to contradict her boss, President Joe Biden, in expressing disappointment over the acquittal of accused Kenosha vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse.
‘Today’s verdict speaks for itself,’ the vice president told reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force Two in Columbus, Ohio, on Friday.
The former California senator and San Francisco district attorney added: ‘I've spent a majority of my career working to make our criminal justice system more equitable.
‘It’s clear, there’s still a lot more work to do.’
Harris’ comments don’t jive with those made by Biden, who told reporters on Friday: ‘I stand by what the jury has concluded. The jury system works and we have to abide by it.’
Those comments by Biden generated a backlash from liberals on Twitter. Later on Friday, Biden issued a written statement saying he was ‘angry’ and 'concerned' over the verdict.
‘While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken,’ the president said in his written statement.
‘I know that we're not going to heal our country's wounds overnight, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under the law,’ he continued.
‘I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law.
‘Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy.’
Public opinion on the verdict was split largely along partisan lines. While Democrats panned the acquittal, Republicans praised it. 
Biden said the White House and federal authorities have been in contact with Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers and offered support as Kenosha and the nation brace for fallout from the verdict. 
In New York City on Friday night, several protesters angry at the verdict assembled outside the Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn. 
This comes as Republicans renewed demands that Biden apologize for calling the Kenosha shooter a white supremacist before the trial. 
Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, said he was dismayed by Biden's depiction of Rittenhouse as a white supremacist.
'I've never had a case, I don't think I ever will, where within two days or three days of one another, you know, the President and the presidential candidate comment on it. And both of them had such different beliefs,' Richards said.
'President Biden said some things, I think are so incorrect and untrue — he is not a white supremacist. I'm glad that he at least respects the jury verdict.'
Tom Cotton, the Republican senator for Arkansas, tweeted: 'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse.'
Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican party, said: 'Before he knew the facts, Biden prejudged the Rittenhouse case. He smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case. What Biden did was dangerous and inflammatory. 
'Biden needs to apologize and ACT NOW before the left uses his lies to fuel violence.' 
Cori Bush, a congresswoman for Missouri and member of 'The Squad' described Rittenhouse's acquittal as 'white supremacy in action'.
'This system isn’t built to hold white supremacists accountable,' she said. 
'It’s why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free. 
'I’m hurt. I’m angry. I’m heartbroken.'
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agreed, tweeting: 'What we are witnessing is a system functioning as designed and protecting those it was designed for.'
Fellow Squad member Ayanna Pressley added: 'Racism & white supremacy remain the bedrock of our legal system. My heart breaks for the family & loved ones of those whose lives were stolen, and the trauma our communities face today and every day. 
'The struggle for accountability, for justice, for healing goes on.' 
The head of the House Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they’re not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people.' 
Donald Trump's PAC, Save America, sent an email soliciting funds for his campaign coffers and stating: 'GREAT NEWS FOR KYLE RITTENHOUSE, who we knew was innocent all along.
'This trial was nothing more than a WITCH HUNT from the Radical Left. They want to PUNISH law-abiding citizens, including a CHILD, like Kyle Rittenhouse, for doing nothing more than following the LAW.'
Dan Bishop, a congressman representing North Carolina, said: 'Don’t forget, Biden labeled a 17-year old Rittenhouse a “white supremacist.” Beyond shameful.'
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman representing Georgia, said that Rittenhouse was 'one of the good guys'.
She attacked Biden for saying he was concerned at the verdict, warned that he was inciting violence, and angrily singled out fellow members of Congress who had condemned Rittenhouse's actions.
'Kyle Rittenhouse ACQUITTED on ALL charges! May Kyle and his family now live in peace. Those who help, protect, and defend are the good guys. Kyle is one of good ones. 
'@JoeBiden is angry & concerned that the jury found Kyle Rittenhouse NOT GUILTY after being shown mountains of evidence proving his innocence. 
'Biden calling for “peaceful protest” now against the verdict. We all know what it means when the left calls for“peaceful” protest..
And Lauren Boebert, the Colorado congresswoman who has made defense of the Second Amendment a pillar of her policies, tweeted: 'Today is a great day for the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense. Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty on all counts! Glory to God!'
Progressives, however, expressed dismay at the verdict.
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they’re not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people. To call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
Rittenhouse did not take a gun across state lines before the shooting: he picked it up from a house in Kenosha.
Cori Bush, a congresswoman representing Missouri who is considered part of 'The Squad' of recently-elected progressives, said the verdict was 'white supremacy in action'.
'The judge. The jury. The defendant. It's white supremacy in action,' she tweeted. 
'This system isn’t built to hold white supremacists accountable. It’s why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free.  
The jury — a couple of them wearing masks — showed no emotion as the verdicts were read after four torturous days of deliberation and weeks of testimony.
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.

COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
DISMISSED - COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it
Rittenhouse's mother Wendy was in the public gallery and burst into tears as the verdicts were read, while Rittenhouse victim Joseph Rosenbaum's fiancée and victim Anthony Huber's girlfriend and great aunt tearfully listened as their loved ones' killer walked free. 
'I’m hurt. I’m angry. I'm heartbroken.' 
Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Progressive Caucus, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
The district attorney for San Francisco, Chesa Boudin - considered one of the most liberal DAs in the country - also criticized the verdict.
'This verdict demonstrates that our work to make our legal system equal, fair, and just is more urgent than ever. Prosecutors have a critical role to play in criminal justice reform and securing equal justice under the law. 
'We will continue our fight for justice.' 
As the first verdict was read Friday afternoon, Rittenhouse, 18, started to shake as he fought back tears. But by the end he could hold them no longer and he collapsed into his chair, then hugged defense attorney Corey Chirafisi. 
Immediately after the verdict was read, Rittenhouse, dressed in a navy blue suit and purple shirt and tie, was whisked out of the courtroom and into a waiting SUV. He was seen smiling as he was driven away. 
Two men in the public gallery gave each other a high-five but apart from that the 'audience' — as Judge Bruce Schroeder called them — remained quiet and filed out of the room.
Clearly disappointed, prosecutor Thomas Binger, who has been heavily criticized for his actions during the case, sat back in his chair, looked at the ceiling, and issued a sigh as the verdict came in. 
Defense attorney Mark Richards slapped the table  after the fifth not guilty verdict was read. 
All that was left was for Schroeder to complement the jurors for being attentive and co-operative. 'I couldn't have wished for a better jury,' he said before reminding them playfully that they are eligible to be selected again in four years' time.
He also told them that they had the right to discuss the case with the media if they wanted, but told them they also had the right not to. Their names have not been released and he said any media requests to talk to them would be handled by the court and passed on to the jurors. 
Now Kenosha is on edge to see whether it descends into violence again. 
Protestors from both sides milled on the courtroom steps — one white man saying how proud he was of Rittenhouse and the verdict, standing feet from a black woman railing about white justice.
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that has threatened to derail proceedings more than once.
Outside the court, defense lawyer Mark Richards said Rittenhouse was feeling a 'huge sense of relief' at the verdict.
'He is on his way home, he wants to get on with his life,' Richards said.
Richards revealed that the defense team had two mock trials, one with Rittenhouse giving testimony and one without and it was clear from the jury reaction that he had to go on the stand.
He also said the jury deliberations were longer than any other case he had been involved in. 
Richards said he believed the Rittenhouse family would move out of the area because of the number of death threats they have received.
'Kyle is in counseling for PTSD. He doesn't sleep at night,' he said.
'Eventually some anonymity will come back to him but I don't think he will continue to live in this area.'
He said Rittenhouse plans to be a nurse.
Richards also criticized prosecutor Thomas Binger. 'Justice is done when the truth is reached. Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth. It's not about winning,' he said.
But he praised Judge Schroeder, saying he had presided over a 'fair trial.'
'He gives you a fair trial as a defendant — but you don't want him to sentence your client,' he said, commenting on his reputation for handing out stiff sentences.
'If we had lost we know what would happen, he would have gotten life in prison. We asked for a fair trial and we got one.'
He defended Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the from a tumbler the jurors who would become alternates, saying the defense team was 'devastated' that three of the jurors they considered most on their side were barred from the final deliberations. 
Binger had made it clear earlier in the week that he would not comment whatever the outcome of the case.
But his boss Kenosha County District Attorney Mike Graveley issued a statement saying: 'We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations.
'Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.'
Graveley added a plea for calm. 'We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.'
The family of Rittenhouse victim Anthony Huber said in a statement, 'Today's verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son. It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people.'
About an hour after the verdict was announced a woman collapsed from what was believed to be an epileptic seizure outside the courthouse.
Police cleared demonstrators as an ambulance rushed to the scene.
The day started quietly as Judge Schroeder went through a docket of other cases. He arrived at the court shortly after 9am, stopping outside to chat with a group of photographers — jokingly asking why there were so many people around neoclassical courthouse which dates back to 1850.
Unlike nearly every other judge anywhere in the country, Schroder makes a point of walking to his chambers through the public gallery in the eggshell-blue-painted court, decorated with oil paintings of local legal luminaries.
Walking with a slight limp, he greeted reporters, court staff and lawyers as he passed through.
The first three hours of the day's proceedings were quiet with a growing feeling in the court that the jurors were hopelessly deadlocked and no verdict would be coming before the weekend. Schroeder stayed in his chambers for most of the time.
But around noon, the judge ordered that the outer door to his chambers should be closed — for the first time in the trial. From then it was clear that the case was about to come to a close.
A few minutes later prosecution and defense attorneys came into the room along with Rittenhouse, who had been spending time outside the courtroom in a private room on the third floor.
Schroeder announced that the jurors had finally reached their verdict and made his warning to the public gallery not to react. 'As you can see there are several members of law enforcement present and you will be whisked out of here if there is any reaction,' he warned.
Then the jury of seven women and five men filed in, taking their seats to the judge's left.
Schroeder told Rittenhouse to face the jury and 'hearken' to what they had to say.
 Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other counts for killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz on August 25, 2020. 
Demonstrators have been gathered outside the Kenosha Courthouse all week, as Evers called in 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard to counter the expected protests.  ",-2
130,"Police in Portland were forced to declare a riot after protestors turned violent, clashing with officers and smashing windows, as looting and protests erupted overnight in major cities following Kyle Rittenhouse's not-guilty verdict. 
Masses of people gathered coast-to-coast Friday night to decry Rittenhouse's acquittal in protests that reflected the divisiveness and anger stoked by the high-profile case. 
Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on August 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Hours after the verdict, police in Portland were forced to declare a riot after about 200 protestors turned destructive, damaging the front gate of the Multnomah County Justice Center and clashing with officers.   
'Due to violent, destructive behavior by a significant part of the crowd, the gathering in downtown Portland is a RIOT. All participants are instructed to proceed away to the WEST,' the Portland Police Bureau wrote on Twitter.
According to police, rioters threw objects at officers, smashed the rear window of a police car as well as windows from the city print shop and spray-painted the justice center building with graffiti that read 'all cops are Kyles, no justice, no peace', FOX 12 reported.  
Protestors were warned they would be arrested and were subject to force if they remained in the area. 
In total, one person was arrested for a warrant and five citations and 17 warnings were issued, FOX 12reported.   
The high profile case has riled the nation and led to Republican senator Tom Cotton to call on President Joe Biden to publicly apologize to Rittenhouse for suggesting the teen was a white supremacist during his presidential campaign. 
Biden tweeted a video where he featured an image of Rittenhouse alongside footage of white supremacist groups. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' Cotton tweeted.
In Chicago looters broke into a Neiman Marcus and a Game Stop on the Southside as protest went on in the downtown area.  
FOX 32 reported that 15 males stormed into a Mag Mile Neiman Marcus store, stealing merchandise and escaping in three separate vehicles. 
Overhead footage shows a South Side GameStop store with broken glass and merchandise on the ground, but police did not confirm if it was a looting, FOX 32 reported.
In New York City, hundreds gathered outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to express their fury in the verdict as similar events unfolded across the nation.
Scores of people were seen marching through New York about 7 p.m. carrying signs that branded Rittenhouse as a 'racist killer' and the judicial system as biased.
'The message is that when you stand up for black liberation, when you stand up for black lives, no matter who you are you automatically become a target of the system,' Na-Lakan Masego, a protester, told CBS New York. 
Another speaker at the rally said the jury's verdict was a blow to the entire nation.
'By allowing Kyle Rittenhouse to walk away, this entire country – this government – has slapped us all in the face for the millionth time,' he told the crowd. 'We cannot allow them to continue treating us like we do not exist because they hurt us.' 
 
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. 
Kenosha itself remained largely quiet as the night wore on.
A crowd of around 40 people gathered at the courthouse but remained peaceful. Many carried signs, including one saying 'Welcome to AmeriKKKa.'
A middle-aged man, wearing a Stars and Stripes hat tried to provoke the crowd with a sign saying 'Rittenhouse Rules!' 
One young woman was arrested after she scrawled the words 'White supremacists are cowards' and 'Judge Schroeder must go' on the courthouse steps. She was referring to the trial's judge, Bruce Schroeder.
Police, who had largely stayed out of sight as the crowd grew, swooped in quickly and hauled her away. 
President Joe Biden has urged peace, saying the country must abide by the jury's verdict. 
New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said the issue revolves around the definition of self-defense, which Rittenhouse claimed to be acting in when he shot the three men.
'It also depends who has a gun, and it also depends on what they're actually fighting for,' he told CBS New York. 'It seems if you are trying to say something about Black Lives Matter or something about justice and equity, it doesn't have the same weight.'
Others chanted 'no justice, no peace,' and 'these racist cops have got to go' as they marched.
One event speaker called on attendees to continue participating in such events as long as it remains necessary, despite the approaching winter.
'Black lives are still mattering and they're still going to be shot down,' she said. 'And when we call on you to show up, I need you to f***ing show up.' 
In Los Angeles, the Coalition for Community Control Over the Police called on its supporters to step up in protest.
'Kyle walked,' the group said on its Facebook page.
It invited protesters to meet Friday afternoon at Florence and Normandie, where outraged masses gathered in 1992 after a jury acquitted four police officers in the brutal beating of Rodney King, sparking the LA riots.
'Bring water and mutual aid items if u want to continue that work.'
Dozens of people gathered at Chicago's Federal Plaza carrying signs that said 'reject racist vigilante terror' and chanting 'lock him up,' the Chicago Tribune reported.
'He is part of a whole fascist movement that is gaining ground around the country and it will not stop until we recognize it and take matters into our own hands nonviolently refusing to accept a racist America,' event speaker Jay Becker told attendees during the peaceful event.
Some shouted: 'The whole damn system is guilty as hell. Indict, convict, send Rittenhouse to jail.'
In Northern California, businesses were boarding their windows and police were erecting barricades to prepare for planned protests, ABC News 7 reported.
About 100 people participated in an Oakland protest.
Portland Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell said during a Friday press conference that it was 'reasonable' to expect protests in that city as well.
'Here in Portland especially, it's reasonable to expect there will be some type of reaction to the verdict,' Lovell told reporters. 'Like we've said many, many times, we're supportive of peaceful protest, people exercising their First Amendment rights.'
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers also called for calm in a statement released Friday afternoon.
'I echo the calls of local Kenosha community leaders and join them in asking everyone who might choose to assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights in any community to please only do so safely and peacefully,' the governor said.
'We must have peace in Kenosha and our communities, and any efforts or actions aimed at sowing division are unwelcome in our state as they will only hinder that healing.'",-2
131,"Thousands of Year 12 students have descended on the glitter strip to kick off a three-week celebration notorious for out-of-control partying.  
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday - but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up in the Sunshine State last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light for festivities on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
Many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning before they hit the shops to stock up on supplies.
As the sun went down the celebrations kicked off with dozens of teens seen enjoying their new-found freedom.
Everyone appeared in high spirits with one girl seen enjoying a ride in a trolley and another having fun on a friend's shoulders. 
A handful of teens were seen chatting to police with some reciving on the spot fines. 
Like so many milestones missed for the past two years due to the Covid pandemic,  schoolies was very close to being added to the list.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",-2
132,"A two-time killer already serving life without the possibility of parole has been jailed for a further 17 years after stabbing another prisoner in a vicious attack caught on film. 
Footage shows Vester Allan Fernando stabbing the young inmate before calmly dropping his weapon and surrendering to prison officers as the victim writhes in a pool of blood.
Fernando is one of Australia's most violent prisoners and this latest attack has likely ensured he will spend the rest of his life in Goulburn's Supermax, the country's most secure jail.
In 1994 he and cousin Brendan Fernando kidnapped, raped and murdered 21-year-old nurse Sandra Hoare at Walgett in north-west New South Wales.
Five years later Fernando stabbed Brendan to death while they were serving life sentences at Lithgow Correctional Centre, west of the Blue Mountains.
Fernando was transferred to Supermax after that murder but was later moved to the North Coast Correctional Centre near Kempsey. 
It was there he stabbed a 26-year-old inmate in the neck, chest and back on the afternoon of April 8 last year.
Fernando was set to set stand trial in the NSW District Court at Port Macquarie but pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to murder. 
Footage of the attack obtained by Daily Mail Australia captures Fernando stabbing the inmate in a frenzied attack under a common area stairway.
As Fernando repeatedly plunges a weapon into the man's body other inmates do nothing to interfere and the wounded prisoner bleeds out on the floor.
The vision shows Fernando slowly walk away from the victim after trying to kill him, tracking blood across the floor on his shoes.
Fernando then slides his weapon towards approaching prison officers, before he calmly raises his hands in the air and lies down in surrender. 
More than a dozen officers swarm the common area as other inmates nonchalantly walk by the crime scene, some barely looking twice as the victim stops moving.
Most of the officers move to surround Fernando, while two go to the aid of the injured inmate with a towel. 
Emergency services were called to the prison about 3.15pm and the stabbed inmate was airlifted to John Hunter Hospital in a critical but stable condition.
Fernando pleaded guilty to the attempted murder in June and was sentenced by Judge Roy Ellis to a further 17 years and one month in jail.
Judge Ellis set a minimum term of 11 years and one month but due to his previous murder convictions Fernando will never be able to apply for parole. 
Another inmate, 28-year-old Atin Munro, was charged with aiding and abetting the attempted murder over the attack but was found not guilty. 
Fernando, who has bulked up considerably during his decades behind bars, was also convicted in 2005 of assaulting a prison officer. 
The Fernando cousins snatched Ms Hoare after she finished a night shift working alone in the geriatric ward of Walgett Base Hospital on December 9, 1994. 
The NSW Supreme Court heard the pair forced Ms Hoare to endure more than an hour of fear and extreme trauma. 
The cousins took Ms Hoare from the hospital to a nearby oval where Brendan held the nurse down while Vester raped her. 
They then forced Ms Hoare to walk 400m to a paddock where they murdered her with a machete. Ms Hoare's body was found with her head almost severed and her underwear missing.
Vester was 27 and Brendan 26 when they were sentenced to life in prison in 1997. 
The older cousin had denied having anything to do with Ms Hoare's murder and blamed Brendan for his conviction and life term.
The cousins were initially kept in separate prisons but later reunited. In September 1999 Fernando murdered Brendan in Lithgow.
He used the blade from a pair of scissors to stab Brendan in the face and chest, piercing his heart, during a music lesson in the prison' auditorium.
In 2001 Fernando was jailed for a further 30 years over Brendan's murder with a 22-year minimum term.
Justice Rod Howie said sentencing Fernando for the murder of Brendan was 'academic' considering he was never to be released for murdering Ms Hoare. 
The inmate Fernando stabbed last year had only recently come into custody and did not have a lengthy criminal history. 
The Mid North Coast Correctional Centre is a maximum, medium and minimum security centre for men and women at Aldavilla, 455km north of Sydney and 14km west of Kempsey. ",-2
133,"Disappointed, prosecutor Thomas Binger, who has been heavily criticized for his actions during the case, sat back in his chair, looked at the ceiling, and issued a sigh as the first verdict in the Kenosha murder trial came in.
Defense lawyer Mark Richards did not hold back, blasting the Kyle Rittenhouse prosecutor within minutes of the end of the trial in Wisconsin.
‘Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth — it’s not about winning,’ he said.
‘This case became about winning and that’s probably why it got so personal.’
Richards was speaking after Rittenhouse, 18, was sensationally cleared of all charges resulting from the night he took his AR-15 rifle from his home in Antioch, Illinois to the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where demonstrators were protesting the shooting of black man Joseph Blake.
He shot Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber dead and injured a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz. But the jury of seven women and five men on Friday found him not guilty of all charges.
‘I’ve known Tom Binger for a long time,’ Richards said. ‘I knew him when he was a civil lawyer. I’m disappointed with some of the things he did.’
Richards was just the latest to criticize Binger’s performance in the two-week trial, in which he frequently butted heads with Judge Bruce Schroeder.
But Binger wasn't alone in the legal line of fire.
Many court watchers believe Binger was thrown into the case because District Attorney Graveley — who would normally prosecute such a high-profile case himself — knew the case against Rittenhouse was weak.
'Binger was set up for failure,' one Kenosha legal insider told DailyMail.com during the trial. 'Graveley is the superstar and he knew this one was sure to tarnish it.'
The conservative Milwaukee Right Now said Graveley 'pawned the case off to his unfortunate assistant district attorney, Thomas Binger, who was left to spin gold out of a pile of self-defense straw.’
Problems started before the trial with the charges that the District Attorney’s office had brought against Rittenhouse.
Then-presidential candidate Joe Biden had called Rittenhouse a white supremacist in a tweet, asking why Donald Trump didn’t disavow such people.
That put huge pressure on Kenosha County District Attorney Graveley to come down hard on Rittenhouse, who was then 17.
He was charged as an adult with first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree attempted intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.
Despite being charged as an adult, he also was charged with possessing a weapon while under the age of 18.
Many court watchers felt the prosecution would have had more success if they had brought lesser charges against him.
Daniel Adams, a former Milwaukee County assistant district attorney who isn’t involved in the trial, described Binger’s case as ‘incredibly underwhelming.’
‘He’s got nothing,’ Adams said. ‘I just don’t understand it. What are we doing here? We’re all kind of scratching our heads.’
Problems grew right from Binger’s opening statement when he claimed that Rittenhouse had ‘chased Joseph Rosenbaum down’ and shot him.
But video footage showed that Rosenbaum — a convicted child molester who had been released from a mental health facility earlier in the day — had chased Rittenhouse and ambushed him.
He threw a plastic bag at the teen, cornering’ him between parked cars before Rittenhouse turned and shot as Rosenbaum, who was carrying a chain, lunged for the muzzle of his gun.
Binger was also embarrassed when he was questioning journalist Richard McGinnis who witnessed Rittenhouse shoot Rosenbaum.
‘You have no idea what Mr. Rosenbaum was thinking at any point of his life. You have never been inside his head. You never met him before,’ he said to McGinnis, adding ‘it’s complete guesswork, isn’t it?’
McGinnis shrugged and replied: ‘Well, he said, “F**k you” and reached for [Rittenhouse’s] weapon.’
There were also problems with the testimony of brothers Sahil and Anmol Khindri, who owned the car dealership that Rittenhouse said he was called to protect.
Sahil said he had not asked Rittenhouse to guard the lot while Anmol said he had not met him. But a photo appeared of the two brothers with Rittenhouse and others taken before the riots began.
‘When they put on the Khindri brothers knowing that they were lying, that is a problem,’ said Richards.
Binger was also widely ridiculed for pointing Rittenhouse’s weapon during the trial and for his many clashes with Judge Schroeder.
The most notable was when he tried to introduce testimony about Rittenhouse’s silence in the months between the shootings and the trial that the judge had explicitly ruled inadmissible in a pre-trial hearing.
‘Why would you think that that made it okay for you without any advance notice to bring this matter before the jury?” Schroeder shouted at Binger.
‘I was astonished when you began your examination by commenting on the defendant’s post-arrest silence. That’s basic law. It’s been basic law in this country for 40 years, 50 years. I have no idea why you would do something like that.’
Schroeder also berated him for talking about Rosenbaum setting a fire.
'All we're talking about is arson. We're talking about being loud and disorderly,' Binger said.
Schroeder immediately cut him off. 'I can't believe some of what you're saying,' he said in a raised voice. 'All we're talking about is arson? Come on!'
Binger, 51, made it clear earlier this week that whatever the outcome of the case he would make no public comment.
Instead it was left to Graveley to issue a statement saying: ‘We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations. Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.
‘We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
After six years prosecuting, he went into private practice as director of litigation for a business law firm before joining the Kenosha County DA's office.
He ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the post of District Attorney in neighboring Racine County in 2016, saying: 'In the last two years as a prosecutor, I have won 13 jury trials. I have convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, drunk drivers, home-invading burglars and men who abuse women.'
One of the most notable cases he has previously prosecuted was of a former New Jersey fire captain who was jailed for five years in 2017 for possessing child pornography and exploiting a child for sexual purposes.
Binger insisted the sentence was not enough, telling Essex News Daily, 'The state recommended 16 years.'
He was also forced to withdraw a case against Guy Smith, a trucker who was found with a gun in his cab. Smith's defense attorney pointed out the law specifically allowed handguns in vehicles without a concealed carry permit, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
The Smith case was also heard by Judge Schroeder.
But those cases had nothing like the media spotlight that has shone on the Rittenhouse case.
Binger's role has been controversial since the start. He took the unusual step of objecting to the attempt by California attorney John Pierce to represent Rittenhouse, saying in a six-page motion to the court that Pierce's presence could 'materially prejudice' the case.
He said Pierce's 'personal financial difficulties raise significant ethical concerns,' adding: 'Given his own substantial personal debts, his involvement with an unregulated and opaque 'slush fund' provides ample opportunity for self-dealing and fraud
'Money that should be held in trust for the defendant may instead be used to repay Attorney Pierce's numerous creditors.'
Pierce, who claimed the case against Rittenhouse was a 'political prosecution' eventually withdrew, leaving the defense in the hands of lawyer Mark Richards.
Binger clashed with Schroeder in pre-trial hearings. Last month the judge ruled against him saying that the men shot by Rittenhouse could not be called 'victims' during the trial but allowed a defense motion which allows them to be called rioters, looters or arsonists.
Thomas Binger is a seven-year veteran at the law office run by Kenosha County's top prosecutor, Michael Graveley. 
Graveley did not personally handling the high-profile Rittenhouse case because he was tasked with the investigation into the police shooting of Jacob Blake at the time Rittenhouse was charged. It was Blake's shooting on August 23 that sparked the Kenosha riots. 
Binger and Judge Bruce Schroeder, who sits on Kenosha County Circuit Court, clashed frequently in the run-up to the trial, and the proceedings were as explosive as expected. 
Schroeder, who at 75 is the longest-serving active circuit judge in Wisconsin, has the reputation of being a stern judge who often hands down tough sentences. 
The website Wisconsin Right Now described his approach as 'bizarre', saying that he frequently made moves that seemed to help the defense in their argument that the teenager acted in self-defense - such as discussing the chaos engulfing Rittenhouse as he opened fire, showing videos of violent protest, and leading Rittenhouse to say that he wanted to help people. 
Binger graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1996 and became a criminal prosecutor at the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office in 1999, where he eventually rose to the rank of assistant district attorney. 
He went on to work for the DeMark, Kolbe & Brodek law firm as director of litigation in 2005 before joining the Kenosha County District Attorney's Office in 2014. 
In 2016, Binger ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the district attorney's seat in Racine County, telling the Journal Times: 'In the last two years as a prosecutor, I have won 13 jury trials. I have convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, drunk drivers, home-invading burglars and men who abuse women.'
He is married to Nicole Gustafson-Binger, a mental health counselor for Oakwood Clinical Associates. They have three children.  
In the lead up to the Rittenhouse murder trial, Binger lost the chance to link Rittenhouse to the Proud Boys extremist group. 
He was later strongly criticized by Judge Schroeder, in pre-trial hearings, after arguing that defense lawyers should not be able to tell jurors about Joseph Rosenbaum's destructive actions during the riot, including setting a dumpster on fire. 
'All we're talking about is arson. We're talking about being loud and disorderly,' Binger said.
Schroeder cut him off and raised his voice.
'I can't believe some of what you're saying,' he said. 'All we're talking about is arson? Come on!'
Schroeder during the trial reprimanded Binger for bringing up information that had previously been barred from the court about Rittenhouse's history with an AR-15 rifle. An incident was caught on video two weeks prior to the shootings in which Rittenhouse talked about shooting men he believed were shoplifting at a pharmacy.
Schroeder had already ruled video inadmissible. 
'You're an experienced trial attorney and you're telling me when the judge says, 'I'm excluding this' you decide to bring it in because you think you've found a way around it,' Schroeder asked. 'Come on!'
Binger replied: 'You can yell at me if you want. I was acting in good faith.' 
Judge Schroeder responded: 'I don't believe you. When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you. There better not be another incident.'
Rittenhouse's defense accused Binger of knowingly attempting to throw the proceeding because they were going badly for the state.
The defense on November 10 demanded a mistrial with prejudice, which would mean that Rittenhouse walks free and a retrial is not possible - a disaster for the prosecution. ",-2
134,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson described the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse as 'a wonderful moment,' praising the jury and insisting it was a day to celebrate - while left-leaning news anchors labeled the verdict a sorry moment in US history.
Carlson, who on Monday will broadcast the first televised interview with Rittenhouse, showed his producers in the car with Rittenhouse as they drove away from the courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday afternoon.
Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by a jury on Friday of all five charges stemming from the death of two protesters, shot and killed by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020.
At the end of the two-week trial, the jury decided that Rittenhouse acted in self defense amid chaotic scenes, with riots in the city sparked by the police shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake.
'The jury reached the correct verdict,' Rittenhouse told Carlson's team.
'Self defense is not illegal. I am glad they reached the correct verdict.'
The teenager added: 'It's been a tough journey but we made it through.
'We made it through the hard part.'
Carlson, one of Rittenhouse's strongest champions, praised the jury for their 'enormous moral courage' and described it as 'a significant day in US history.'
On other networks, the response was distinctly different.
Chris Cuomo, on CNN, said that Rittenhouse had been 'weaponized' by Carlson, whom he described as 'one of the most toxic and divisive people in our society'.
Cuomo said he thought the verdict was right, however. 
'While he was not guilty, it was wrong and hurtful and people are dead and we shouldn't be celebrating,' Cuomo said.
'The law rules. And the law here is the bad guy. That self defense law is pitiful. He was allowed to carry that rifle under the law.' 
His CNN colleague Don Lemon said: 'We should respect the justice system in Kenosha. The laws that are in place are the main reason he was acquitted.
'It is hard to separate race from this case. It may not be the main issue, but it was there.'
He later added: 'Race is definitely a part of this.' 
Chuck Todd, a host on MSNBC, said that he felt the verdict emboldened people to carry guns at protests. 
'The next time there's a protest of some sort, and it may get politicized, that gun owners, with a certain ideology may feel incentivized now, may feel even emboldened,' Todd said. 
'Anyone who supports Black Lives Matter should be very afraid after this,' said Joy-Ann Reid, another MSNBC host. 
Nicolle Wallace attempted to put Rittenhouse in the same category as domestic terrorists.
'The Kyle Rittenhouse acquittal today - not guilty on all counts - did not happen in a cultural vacuum,' she said.
'There's alarming context to this moment we're considering and talking about.
'Last week, the department of homeland security released its latest bulletin warning Americans, again, of the ongoing threat posed by domestic violent extremists.
'We should also point out conservative media for many, many months have been priming its audience for this moment, framing Rittenhouse as a hero.' 
Carlson accused the Left of having 'endorsed mob violence' and said Rittenhouse was a patriot protecting his father's hometown. 
'The jury confirmed what was obvious from the very beginning,' said Carlson.
'It was a wonderful moment.'
He said it showed that 'propaganda doesn't always win. Today it was soundly defeated - thank God.' 
And he criticized rival networks for their framing of the trial in racial terms.
'It doesn't have anything to do with anything,' Carlson said.
'But it's been a fixation of the Democratic party.
'They try to racialize everything,' he said, accusing them of 'trying to whip people into a frenzy'. 
His guest, Brazil-based journalist Glenn Greenwald, remarked that three of Brazil's top newspapers had to apologize for referring to Rittenhouse's victims as being black.  
Sean Hannity, also on Fox News, responded: 'My message to Kyle Rittenhouse tonight: Sue them all, starting with the president.
'This was a clear cut case of self-defense. We do not operate under mob rule.
'If anyone at fake news CNN or MSNBC had an ounce of decency they would apologize. They are con artists. They are always wrong; they always rush to judgement.'
Hannity said that Rittenhouse should sue Biden after the then-candidate last year posted a tweet, after a campaign debate, labelling Rittenhouse a white supremacist.  
Geraldo Rivera, Hannity's guest, got into a blazing row about whether Rittenhouse should sue Joe Biden - with Judge Jeanine Pirro yelling from the sidelines.
Rivera said the suggestion of suing the president was 'absurd'. 
Hannity replied: 'It's okay to call somebody a white supremacist with no facts?'
'May I finish the sentence?' Rivera continued. 'The person that Rittenhouse should sue first is the guy who was his original attorney who sought to make a political statement who dragged this 17-year-old kid to the bar with the Proud Boys and allowed this narrative of white supremacy.'
'Oh, cut it out, Geraldo!' Pirro shouted.
'That's ridiculous,' Hannity said. 
'I want to know if you refer to somebody who is not a white supremacist and not a public figure, and you call them a white supremacist, that's not defamation?'
Rivera replied: 'Sean, what you and I get called every day…'
Hannity retorted: 'He's not a public figure.'
The argument continued for several minutes. 
Hannity's other guest, Miranda Devine, said that the case was 'a modern day To Kill a Mockingbird,' and that Rittenhouse's lawyer was Atticus Finch.
She said it was about a poor, 'defenseless' man who took on the system.
'That poor kid,' she said.
'My heart went out to him. I really hope he can get on with his life.
'He deserves to be vindicated, and allowed to get on with his life.' 
Cori Bush, a congresswoman for Missouri and member of 'The Squad' described Rittenhouse's acquittal as 'white supremacy in action'.
'This system isn't built to hold white supremacists accountable,' she said. 
'It's why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free. 
'I'm hurt. I'm angry. I'm heartbroken.'
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agreed, tweeting: 'What we are witnessing is a system functioning as designed and protecting those it was designed for.'
Fellow Squad member Ayanna Pressley added: 'Racism & white supremacy remain the bedrock of our legal system. My heart breaks for the family & loved ones of those whose lives were stolen, and the trauma our communities face today and every day. 
'The struggle for accountability, for justice, for healing goes on.' 
The head of the House Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they're not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people.' ",-2
135,"Left-leaning celebrities took to Twitter to voice their outrage over Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal on murder charges, with legendary performer Bette Midler calling it a ‘tragic day’ and others bemoaning a perceived miscarriage of justice.
Midler fumed at Friday’s verdict to her 2 million followers, saying: ‘#kylerittenhouse found not guilty tho we SAW HIM kill two.
‘Fundamentally stupid, I predict he will go on to a big career on #Fox and in #RadicalRightWing circles, which counts as a plus with them. A tragic, tragic day for decent, THINKING, feeling, ethical people everywhere.’
 Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.     
Donald Trump was one of the few voices in Rittenhouse's camp as he congratulated Rittenhouse, a supporter of the former president, for beating the rap.  
 'Congratulations to Kyle Rittenhouse for being found INNOCENT of all charges,' said Trump in an emailed statement.
‘It’s called being found NOT GUILTY - And by the way, if that’s not self defense, nothing is!' 
 However, his voice was drowned out by a slew of TV and movie stars expressing outrage over Rittenhouse’s vindication. 
Talk show house Andy Cohen summed up his thoughts in five words, tweeting: ‘What in the actual f***.’
Actress Sophia Bush – who is not related to the political dynasty – was as succinct.
‘No words,’ she tweeted to her 1.2 million followers. ‘Just fury.’
She included an illustration that depicted Rittenhouse bragging about the killings to his bar pals and later appearing to sob over his actions in court.
Actress Rosanna Arquette said the ruling prompted her to lose faith in the legal process.
‘I have no faith in the justice system In America today,’ she tweeted. ‘I don’t want to live in a country that is ruled by violent ignorant racists.’
Rittenhouse could be seen smiling in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse Friday afternoon after being cleared of all charges.
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz.
Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, reacted to the verdict in a series of tweets.
‘I know so many are weary and tired,’ she tweeted. ‘But justice is not just about verdicts.
‘It is a continuum. We can galvanize around changing our culture, including challenging the difference in how a Black male teen would have been engaged in Kenosha.’
She later added: ‘I believe that it’s extremely important that we get back to the reason why people were even protesting in Kenosha - Police Brutality.’
Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly was one of the few luminaries that said the jury got it right.
‘Justice was done,’ she tweeted. ‘Kyle Rittenhouse was unfairly maligned by a dishonest press, and politicians who used him to advance their own fortunes.
‘If there are riots, these smear merchants will shoulder much of the blame.’  ",-2
136,"Kyle Rittenhouse is now a free man, but he's far from leaving the spotlight.
Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson revealed Friday that there was a Fox Nation crew filming for a Tucker Carlson Original documentary that will appear on the streaming platform in December. He will also sit down with Rittenhouse this Monday during Fox News Channel primetime for the young man's first televised interview following his not guilty verdict.
But Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, told CNN he 'did not approve of that,' referring to the film crew being with Rittenhouse during the trial, and even 'threw them out of the room several times.' 
'I don't think a film crew is appropriate for something like this, but the people who were raising the money to pay for the experts and to pay for the attorneys were trying to raise money and that was part of it, so I think, I don't want to say an evil but a definite distraction was part of it,' he told Chris Cuomo Friday. 'I didn't approve of it but I'm not always the boss.'
Rittenhouse, 18, was found not guilty Friday of all charges against him after a highly publicized, contentious trial that has split the nation. He smiled in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse after being declared not guilty, later commenting that 'self-defense is not illegal.'
Tucker himself referred to the verdict Friday as 'a wonderful moment,' praising the jury and insisting 'all of us should be celebrating.' 
The film crew and upcoming documentary raise questions about just what influence Carlson - one of the nation's most-watched cable news hosts and highly influential conservative commentator - had on Rittenhouse in the lead-up to and during the trial, and whether or not Rittenhouse was or will be paid for the documentary.

'It's the stuff that keeps you up at night, like... once you finally do get to sleep, your dreams are about what happened and you're waking up in a dark, cold sweat,' Rittenhouse begins in the trailer for the Fox Nation documentary that was posted Friday mere hours after the verdict.
'You had dreams about what happened?' someone can be heard asking Rittenhouse.
'Every single night,' the teen says. '... I'm alive, but what would have happened, like what if I wasn't alive, or what if I did let Mr. [Joseph] Rosenbaum steal my gun?'
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. 
'Almost every outcome is either me getting seriously injured or hurt or dead,' Rittenhouse says in the trailer. 
'Those are just the dreams I have on a daily basis,' he adds, with the preview then cutting to footage of the verdict being read on Friday.  
The teen had collapsed in tears and hugged his attorney as the jury in his double murder trial acquitted him of all charges after four days of deliberation and weeks of testimony. The verdict came in at 12:15 p.m. Friday in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  
'The jury reached the correct verdict,' Rittenhouse told Fox News.
'Self-defense is not illegal. I am glad they reached the correct verdict.' 
He added: 'It's been a tough journey but we made it through. We made it through the hard part.'
The vindicated teen will sit down with Fox News Channel for his first TV interview on Monday at 8 p.m. ET, Carlson said. 
Part of the interview will air that evening, while the remaining portion will be included in Tucker Carlson Originals, the news network said.
Carlson has publicly sympathized with Rittenhouse in the past. 
'People in charge from the governor of Wisconsin on down refused to enforce the law,' he said in August 2020.
'They stood back and watched Kenosha burn. So are we really surprised this looting and arson accelerated to murder? How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?' 
Outside the court on Friday, Richards said his client was feeling a 'huge sense of relief' at the verdict.
'He is on his way home, he wants to get on with his life,' Richards said. 'He has to get on with his life the best he can.' 
The lawyer said he believed the Rittenhouse family would move out of the area because of the number of death threats they have received.
'Kyle is in counseling for PTSD. He doesn't sleep at night,' he said. 
'Eventually some anonymity will come back to him but I don't think he will continue to live in this area,' his lawyer continued.
'I think it's too dangerous,' Richards added. He explained that Rittenhouse has had security following him around the clock 'since this happened.' 
He said Rittenhouse and his team have received a 'scary' amount of death threats. 
Richards revealed that the defense team had two mock trials, one with Rittenhouse giving testimony and one without, and it was clear from the jury reaction that he had to go on the stand. 
He also said the jury deliberations were longer than any other case he had been involved in.
Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted in the killings, his lawyer said the teen plans to become a nurse. 
Shortly before he traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, armed with an AR-15 - where he shot and killed two protesters on August 25, 2000 - Rittenhouse gave an interview to right-wing news outlet The Daily Caller. 
Armed with a rifle slung across his body, the teen told the outlet that he was a certified EMT and said he was patrolling the streets of Kenosha to provide medical attention to anyone in need and was helping protect local businesses from looters and rioters. 
'People are getting injured. Our job is to protect this business and part of my job is to also help people,' Rittenhouse said of his militia at the time.  
'If there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way,' added Rittenhouse, who was seen earlier guarding a local car shop with a group of armed militia members. 
'That's why I have my rifle because I can protect myself, obviously. I also have my med kit.'
He also claimed he had been 'de-escalating' a potentially violent situation earlier in the night, during which he and the rest of his vigilante crew ordered protesters to leave a church that they had targeted.  
After the trial, Rittenhouse's lawyer took out his anger on prosecutor Thomas Binger. 
'Justice is done when the truth is reached. Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth. It's not about winning,' Richards said.
But he praised Judge Bruce Schroeder, saying he had presided over a 'fair trial.'
'He gives you a fair trial as a defendant - but you don't want him to sentence your client,' he said, commenting on his reputation for handing out stiff sentences.
'If we had lost, we know what would happen, he would have gotten life in prison. We asked for a fair trial and we got one.'
He defended Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the from a tumbler the jurors who would become alternates, saying the defense team was 'devastated' that three of the jurors they considered most on their side were barred from the final deliberations.
Binger had made it clear earlier in the week that he would not comment on the outcome of the case.
But his boss, Kenosha County District Attorney Mike Graveley, issued a statement saying: 'We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations.
'Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.'
Graveley added a plea for calm: 'We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.' 
The Rittenhouse shootings took place during 2020 summertime riots two days after Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot when police officers responded to a 'family trouble' around 5:15 p.m. August 23, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Kenosha was again on edge Friday as protesters from both sides milled about on the courthouse steps after the verdict. 
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that had threatened to derail proceedings more than once. 
President Joe Biden said Friday that he stands by the jury's verdict - as Republicans renewed demands that he apologize for calling the Kenosha shooter a white supremacist in the wake of the shootings.
'I stand by with the jury as the jury system has concluded. The jury system works and you have to abide by it,' Biden told reporters Friday afternoon as he returned to the White House from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had a routine physical.
He said he 'just heard a moment ago' about the verdict, adding he 'didn't watch' the trial, which featured dramatic clashes between the prosecution and defense lawyers and testimony by the accused teen in an event that got gavel-to-gavel cable news coverage. 
Republican lawmakers and other officials are demanding that Biden apologize to Rittenhouse for linking him to white supremacists while campaigning for president. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said in a statement immediately after the verdict.
Before he gained infamy, Rittenhouse was a hot-tempered student at Lakes Community High School, his former classmates said.
'When he got mad or offended he would always say he could ""f***me up,"" but everyone would just laugh because he was like a 5-foot-4 chubby freshman boy who we thought wasn't capable of harm,' a student told Vice right after the shooting in August 2020.
Other classmates told the outlet that Rittenhouse was fond of police, guns, former President Donald Trump and 'triggering the libs.' 
Rittenhouse was born January 3, 2000, to parents Wendy and Mike and grew up in a broken home after the couple split.
Wendy Rittenhouse, a single mom of three, struggled to make ends meet and the family was evicted numerous times, The New Yorker reported.
She filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and was hospitalized with a gastrointestinal bleed, prompting her son to find work as a fry cook and janitor to support the family financially, the outlet said.
When he was in ninth grade, the aspiring first responder joined an 'explorers program' at the Grayslake Police Department in Illinois, which the local police chief said was meant to 'teach self-discipline, responsibility and other appropriate life lessons to troubled teens,' the magazine reported.
He also enrolled in a cadet program at the Antioch Fire Department, with Chief Jon Cokefair telling The New Yorker: 'Most of the kids that are doing this, they don't play football, they're not cheerleaders. This is their focus.'
By all accounts, Rittenhouse seemed to idolize the police.
Before Rittenhouse's Facebook account was deactivated, it reflected the young man's admiration for law enforcement, which he praised heavily on social media.
In a photograph posted by his mother, Kyle is seen wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform and the kind of brimmed hat state troopers wear. 
Records show that in January 2017, his mom claimed a classmate of her son's had been calling him 'dumb' and 'stupid' and threatening him as she sought an order of protection from police.  
Rittenhouse was identified in court papers as a lifeguard at a YMCA in Lindenhurst, Illinois. 
In January 2020, Rittenhouse sat front row at a Trump rally in Des Moines, Iowa. 
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.

COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
DISMISSED - COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it",-2
137,"A young woman has opened up about how she went from being a successful real estate agent to an ice addict just 10 years ago and shared the surprising way she managed to turn it all around. 
Before her life spiralled out of control, Jessica Gaddes, 31, was a real-estate agent in Penrith, Western Sydney. She owned her own home, was in a loving relationship and enjoyed travelling overseas.  
She blames herself for slipping into a 'black hole'. 
Scroll down for video 
From the age of 15 Ms Gaddes started engaging in 'risky teen behaviour' to try to fit in with friends. She began drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana. 
Her risky behaviour followed her into adulthood where she began snorting speed, a drug which she described as 'a big thing back then'. 
But it wasn't until she tried the drug Ice for the first time where her life began to enter a downward spiral. 
'It took my soul,' she told Seven News.  
Ms Gaddes was renovating her house when a friend suggested they smoke speed to help the pair work faster, naively she agreed. 
'And I didn't say no, only it wasn't speed... it was ice,' she said. 
From that day on she formed a crippling addiction where she consumed Ice almost every day for the next five years. 
After three months she sold her house to try and escape the drug by moving to Surfers Paradise, only to find her new apartment block riddled with drug dealers. 
'I remember telling myself 'I am going to die an addict'.'
In another attempt to get clean Ms Gaddes made the move to Sydney but soon found herself in trouble with law enforcement and behind bars.
She didn't consider going to rehab until her drug dealer suggested it.  
At first Ms Gaddes didn't think she needed rehab. 
But on her 28th birthday Ms Gaddes' addiction landed her locked up inside a dirty cell. She said it was the moment she needed in order to 'get her life together'.
Despite a string of run-ins with the law Ms Gaddes attributed her willingness to get clean to police - who she says 'loved me back to life'. 
'They kept setting me straight even though I kept failing them, they never gave up on me.'
But it wasn't an easy road. 
Homeless and living on the streets of Mt Druitt in Western Sydney, Ms Gaddes was in and out of rehab centres around the state. 
She continued using Ice for five years where she found herself hanging around 'bad people and doing bad things'.
It wasn't until a month long stint in jail for a string of drug related charges that Ms Gaddes went to rehab for the final time. 
Six years clean from the drug that stole most of her twenties, Ms Gaddes now works in the hospitality industry as a bartender.  
She believes if she continued using for one more year, she would have died. 
Determined to help other addicts Ms Gaddes is hoping to move into the professional realm of recovery, starting from her hometown in the Western Sydney Community.
Ms Gaddes now dedicates herself to sharing her journey to recovery on social media in an effort to help support people battling mental health and addiction. 
She candidly posts her lived experience on her Instagram and TikTok drawing praise from social media users for breaking the stigma surrounding addiction.",-2
138,"As a physical education teacher in Loudoun County, Virginia, I serve a very diverse community in Leesburg. I love and respect all my students and treat them with dignity despite our differences.
My recent court win is an important step toward protecting freedom of expression for everyone. My hope is that it will encourage educators across the nation to freely advocate for their students without fear of consequence. Some Americans have lost sight of the importance of open debate. 
The Loudoun County School Board recently passed a policy that forces teachers to call students by pronouns that are contrary to biology and violate my faith as a Christian.
The policy forces me and my colleagues to subject the very children that we are charged to love and protect to a dangerous ideology that could lead to puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and even sterilization.
While the policy was still under review, I took the time, in my personal capacity, to speak at a school board meeting that was open to the public. I told board members that, as a teacher, I cannot lie to these kids—no good teacher would. However, the policy would force me to do just that, and I urged them to rethink it.
Two days later, I got a call to come into Human Resources, where I was informed that I was being suspended for ‘disruptive behavior.’
I didn’t understand what was disruptive about expressing my concern for my students at a public school-board meeting in the county where I live and pay taxes. I later came to learn that the disruption they were referring to was five parents’ e-mails sent to my school complaining about my speech at the school board meeting. 
As a result of the e-mails, the school board determined that it was enough to jeopardize my family’s livelihood and my future as a teacher. Think about the implications of a school board giving into such demands so quickly—simply as a result of a teacher’s views. 
Freedom of expression is a core liberty and a human right, and the school board was trying to take that away from me. I decided to stand up for what I believe in, and to protect my students. I was fortunate to have the assistance of Alliance Defending Freedom to challenge the violation I was facing and defend my rights in court.
First, the court temporarily ordered the school board to reinstate my job. The Virginia Supreme Court later upheld that order. Now the school district has agreed to settle my case.
As part of that settlement, the trial court permanently prohibited the Loudoun County School Board from punishing me for expressing my views. Teachers are just like everyone else; we have legitimate ideas and views we should be free to peacefully express. No government should be able to force its citizens to say things they disagree with.  
This is especially true in schools, where the marketplace of ideas should be fiercely protected, both for the sake of freedom and the sake of truth. The court has vindicated those rights for me and for all teachers. I can now confidently continue teaching at Leesburg Elementary School without fear of punishment for expressing my views.
It’s been a long, emotional journey up to this point, but I know it’s worth pursuing. As exhausting as it is, I know there’s still more work to be done to truly protect freedom in Loudoun County.
The school board adopted the policy I objected to, Policy 8040, and two of my colleagues, Monica Gill and Kimberly Wright, have joined me to take a bold stand to see that the same rights that we have outside the school are protected inside the school. Our constitutionally protected freedoms don’t vanish when we walk through the school doors.
Monica, Kimberly, and I know that not every parent sees things the way that we do, and we respect that. But some would rather see certain voices silenced or, even worse, compelled to speak in ways that violate our deeply held faith, instead of being allowed to engage in the debate.
Call it cancel culture, call it censorship, call it what you want—all of our freedoms are threatened when the culturally accepted narrative is the only option for discussion.
America is large and diverse, and some of us don’t agree with the ideas that are touted as truth by cable news networks, Hollywood executives, or political leaders. We shouldn’t be singled out for censorship. 
Parents should be allowed to have a say in what goes on in their kids’ schools. We recently witnessed a regime change in the Virginia governor’s office, in part because parents in our commonwealth are waking up to what’s going on.
As a result of what was happening here in Loudoun County, many parents saw that it was time for a change to protect their children from these harmful and radical ideologies. If we’re allowed to debate ideas, kids will learn how to value people while engaging with different opinions in a respectful way. 
Silencing opposing voices only teaches kids that you can get your way by bullying others. Teachers and parents have unique viewpoints when it comes to topics like efforts to control COVID-19 outbreaks, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity ideology. 
In my case, the Loudoun County Court took us a big step closer toward allowing those viewpoints to be voiced without punishment. I love all my students, and I enjoy teaching them health and physical education. In my classroom, every student will continue to be treated with dignity, respect, and care. 
This is much more than a job for me; it is who I am. I don’t see myself as a rebel or revolutionary. I’m just a P.E. teacher who cares deeply about the health and future of my students. Monica, Kimberly, and I are taking a stand for what we believe is right and good for all Americans, not just us.",-2
139,"A junior who played on a winning basketball team stayed behind with arena staff for three hours to help clean up the stands and pick up the trash left behind by fans.
Dexter Dennis who is known for his for his fast moves on the court was praised for what he did off the court long after the game, held  in Wichita, Kansas, was over.
Dennis who was on the Wichita State University men's basketball team that beat Tarleton State 65-51 decided to help tidy up the stadium after the game instead of heading off to celebrate the victory with teammates.
Dennis, who hails from Louisiana, helped propel the team, known as the Shockers to victory and into a tournament in Las Vegas. 
Dennis scored 13 points, 10 of those in the second half, for Wichita State (3-0). He was 3-of-4 from 3-point range. 
Wichita State shot 42.9 percent from the field, and Tarleton State finished at 38.3 percent. 
But it was Dennis' humble act long after the spectators had gone home that got people talking. 
The simple act of him staying behind to pick up trash was captured by a reporter who was in the stands opposite after everyone else had left the court. 
The cleanup can normally takes up to three hours.  
'Dexter is a different kind of dude,' sports reporter for The Wichita Eagle, Taylor Eldridge, tweeted together with the video he shot that has since gone viral. 
'Wasn't in trouble or anything. Didn't have to. He just wanted to help out the cleaning crew,' Eldridge added. 
Dennis tweeted about the incident stating: 'Didn't do it for attention. Just gives me perspective on life. It could always be worse.' 
His efforts were recognized by Wichita State University Facilities Director David Gomez.
'We have several folks who have been here for decades and I know for some of them, that's probably the first time they've seen something like that happen,' said Gomez to CBS News. 
'And I just, from our custodial staff, out to him, we just want to say thank you for leading and showing us that there are still folks out there who recognize the hard work that's done around here.' ",-2
140,"A nine-year-old girl who fought off a robber by punching him in the face after he attached her mother and tried to steal her purse is being honored for her bravery by Florida police who say they’re proud of her crime-fighting actions.
Journee Nelson and her mom, Danielle Mobley, were running errands in West Palm Beach on November 2 when they were attacked outside Sabor Tropical Supermarket.
Surveillance footage shows a man lunging toward Mobley as the two return to their parked car.
Without hesitation, little Journee races to the aid of her mom, pummeling the thief as he tries to steal the woman’s purse.
‘I fought back,’ the girl told 7 News Miami. ‘I had to save my mom.’
Chief Frank Adderley said during a press conference Thursday that while he wouldn’t recommend confronting criminals, the girl’s actions were understandable during the heat of the moment.
‘I bet he was shocked when she hit him right on the face,’ Adderly told reporters. ‘You definitely could tell on the video tape he was not expecting that. Her actions were perfect timing in this particular situation.
‘I think she hit him pretty hard.’

Her mom told reporters that Journee stepped in to help shortly after the robber knocked her to the ground.
‘I’m very proud of her, that [helping] was her initial reaction,’ Mobley said. ‘I wish things could be a little different because she is still dealing with this mentally.’
She said Journee chased the man down the block as he made off with her purse.
‘She actually jumped up and chased him four houses down the block with me chasing her, calling her back,’ her mom said.

141,"Tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has bought a significant chunk of the South Sydney Rabbitohs but exactly how much money he paid for it remains unknown.  
The founder of Atlassian, who is worth an estimated $26billion, now owns a 25 per cent share in the famous NRL club, but he has kept the price tag a secret. 
One source believes the figure is close to the $20 million mark. 
According to the Daily Telegraph, fellow high profile part owners - media mogul James Packer and Hollywood actor Russell Crowe - were set to receive $10 million each following the recent injection from Cannon-Brookes.
The purchase comes after both men reduced their 37.5 per cent shareholding to 25 per cent to enable Cannon-Brookes to also enjoy a quarter share of the club.
Members of the Rabbitohs own the remaining quarter. 
Crowe has remained tight-lipped, stating he was 'not at liberty to discuss details'.
Eventually, ASIC documents will pinpoint exactly how much Cannon-Brookes handed over to Blackcourt League Investments, the company who owns 75 per cent of the Rabbitohs, for his share. 
On November 15, it became public knowledge Cannon-Brookes had bought into Russell Crowe's footy team after going on a lavish $70million rural Australian property spending spree. 
The string of new investments take the philanthropist's estimated wealth to $26billion, comfortably exceeding Packer's net worth of $5billion. 
'The South Sydney Rabbitohs are special. Not only are we the oldest, loudest and proudest, we are an organisation people truly, deeply care about,' he said.
'I'm looking forward to partnering with Russell and James and bringing what I can to the table to help the club grow to even greater heights.' 
Cannon-Brookes, who in 2020 became the first Australian to own an American sports team after buying a minority stake in NBA side the Utah Jazz, said there was renewed pressure at leading South Sydney.
'It's one thing to have a really great legacy culture – 'the oldest, proudest, loudest' is written pretty deeply in people's psyches – but it also comes with a sense of that culture of continuing to improve,' he said.
Souths were infamously booted out of the competition in 1999 after a series of financial problems, before a campaign led by Crowe began to see the game's oldest and most successful club re-admitted.
They were re-instated in the NRL back in 2002 and 12 years later won the premiership in emotional scenes for the 'pride of the league.'
Crowe revealed he'd been working to get Cannon-Brookes involved for some time and regularly had him appearing in public wearing Rabbitohs merchandise. 
'I'm sure it hasn't gone unnoticed to South Sydney members and supporters that Mike wears a white Rabbitohs hat for special occasions,' Crowe told News Corp.
'This is a very strong move for the club. It connects us to the front edge of emerging technologies and business, and underlines the importance of our efforts in the community.
'Mike understands the resonance of sport in Australia, and James and I welcome his input going forward in keeping South Sydney ahead of the curve, and a game leading organisation, on and off the field.' 
Packer, who has amassed wealth across media and casinos, said he was excited Cannon-Brookes was coming aboard to help with the team's community program. 
'I am really pleased that Mike is joining us, because I know how committed he is to the community, he will be a big asset and supporter of Souths Cares and all the important work they do,' he said.
Earlier in November, Cannon-Brookes bought out a Melbourne Cup-winning racehorse stud as part of his ambitious personal mission to make Australia greener.
The purchase of the $15.25million, 120-hectare Think Big Stud is the latest acquisition in a massive $70million buy-up of property and land in the Southern Highlands, 120km south of Sydney.  
He is planning to transform the properties he buys into a green paradise using 'regenerative agriculture' - with part of his plan to encourage Australians to eat crickets and other insects. 
The 41-year-old has already pledged $1.5billion to climate initiatives.
'[I] have heavy investments in controlled environment agriculture because it turns electricity into farming,' he tweeted. 
'99 per cent less emissions from transport, 95 per cent less water and 95 per cent less land use. 
'Renewables make it continually better.'
He has also warned the world needs to change its eating habits by adding insects to its daily diet if the planet is to feed a global population of eight billion.
'Insects are a huge part of a sustainable future,' he said.
'I'm a big fan of cricket flour and insect eating in general. The logic totally stacks up - Low planet footprint, high protein, sustainable etc.
'Always looking for interesting opportunities in that space!'
The tech boss's latest buy, the Think Big Stud, was home to the 2008 Melbourne Cup and Caulfield Cup winner Viewed, as well as other Group One champions. 
Cricket flour is a high protein flour
It is far less intensive to farm
It requires much less water than wheat 
It is said to taste nutty but the flavour can be easily disguised
Crickets are killed by exposing them to low temperatures and putting them into stasis. They are then freeze-dried
 You can also pan fry them for a tasty crunchy snack 
They are said to be a highly nutritious and cheap source of protein, fat, minerals, vitamins and fibre
Atlassian boss Mike Cannon-Brookes believes they are the solution to feeding the world's 8 billion people 
The Southern Highlands property in Burradoo, near Moss Vale, was owned by Malaysian billionaire Dato Tan Chin Nam until his death in 2018, and is just the latest in a series of local acquisitions for the former Cranbrook schoolboy.
He has been snapping up a series of estates and properties in the area including the 258-hectare, 15-bedroom Wattle Ridge farm for $13million.  
Mr Cannon-Brookes also has another 15-bedroom mansion, Cooliatta, also at Burradoo, for which he paid $3.9million, as well as Rosehill Farm, worth $5.9million, and two other farms including Widgee Waa which cost him $14.5million.
He now has at least seven properties or estates in the area - and is tipped to buy more.
The controversial Hume Coal mine planned for the Moss Vale area was finally blocked by the NSW Independent Planning Commission last month.
Now the massive South Korean-owned 1300 hectare estate has also been linked to the green billionaire as his next possible acquisition.
Mr Cannon-Brookes is number three on the AFR's Rich List after founding the multinational company behind project management tools like Trello and Jira.
He has repeatedly slammed the Australian government for their approach to climate change - and blasted Prime Minister Scott Morrison's plan that he took to COP26.
'I read all 129 pages of the pamphlet' he tweeted. 'It's not worth the paper I didn't print it on. 
'I understand technology damn well. This isn't a 'technology driven approach'. It's inaction, misdirection and avoiding choices. 
'This is just ridiculously embarrassing.'
He and his wife Annie have vowed to transform their farmland into green-sensitive pastures. 
'Regenerative agriculture' aims to tackle a holistic approach to farming by careful soil and water management and rethinking the approach to fertilisers.
It aims to 'improve the resources it uses, rather than destroying or depleting them,' say proponents, by rotating crops, diversifying and allowing paddocks to lie empty.
The tech boss also brings the latest technology to his farms too. 
'[I do] everything I can,' he recently told the Sydney Morning Herald. 
'I drive an electric vehicle. I live on a farm that runs almost entirely on sunlight, electricity. I have electric farm vehicles up the wazoo.'  
And he believes Australia could be the 'Saudi Arabia of renewable electricity' if the political will was there. 
He added: 'We could power the entire world five times over from the Australian sun that we have. 
'It's a good measure of how large our country is, and how much great sun we have. We have a country almost designed to benefit most from the renewable boom. 
'And we have three billion consumers nearby who can take our sunlight when we ship it up to Asia. We absolutely can be a renewable energy superpower.' ",-2
142,"The US Army will ban all unvaccinated soldiers who do not provide medical exemption from re-enlisting or being promoted if they make their refusal to get the shot final. 
The new policy, announced on Tuesday, includes all soldiers in the Army and the Reserves. It also applies to all National Guardsmen who work in states where the governor has not mandated vaccines, like Florida, Texas and Oklahoma.  
The move will effectively end unvaccinated soldiers' military careers if they do not make the June 2022 deadline. 
The November 16 memo, signed by Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, states that a service member's record will be flagged the day they make their final vaccine refusal - which requires a meeting with a medical professional and a second order to get vaccinated, Defense One reported. 
'I authorize commanders to impose bars to continued service…for all soldiers who refuse the mandatory vaccine order without an approved exemption or pending exemption request,' Wormuth wrote. 
'The soldier will remain flagged until they are fully vaccinated, receive an approved medical or administrative exemption, or separate from the Army.'
An Army soldier, who asked to remain anonymous and is opting not to get the vaccine, told DailyMail.com: 'It's heartbreaking being told that. I love my country, that's why I signed up to help protect it. I raised my right hand and swore to support and protect the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic,' he said.
'I think what's happening is unconstitutional and a violation of our rights as citizens...I have my own personal reasons on why I don't want the vaccine. 
'I'm being forced to walk away from my dreams with a broken heart and guilt of failing those I love,' he told DailyMail.com. 
Roughly 66 per cent of all branches of the Army, including the Guard is fully vaccinated. 
The Army is 92 per cent vaccinated, while the Reserve and National Guard are 55 and 52 per cent vaccinated, respectively, according to the US Army. 
The National Guard, which is mainly controlled on a state level until Title 32, has the lowest level of vaccination rates and some governors are rebuking the federal mandate. 
Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt recently told troops the state's National Guard that they do not need to comply with President Joe Biden's mandate, which requires all troops in uniform to be vaccinated. 
Stitt reported to the Pentagon that around 800 members were not planning on receiving the vaccine, which is 10 per cent of the state force. 
The Pentagon rejected this dispute, saying that the Guard is still required to meet military readiness and medical requirements, such as vaccinations, according to CNN. 
'The Army’s focus continues to be maintaining a ready force to respond when our nation calls,' an Army representative told DailyMail.com.   
The National Guard remains until Title 32, unless it is activated under federal orders, or Title 10, where the government can control the Guard. This is typically seen when soldiers are deployed overseas.  
A gray area is created since the government funds the National Guard, despite soldiers being under state control. Since the Army depends on remaining a ready force for overseas missions - which was used in Iraq and Afghanistan - the government pays for the troops, despite members reporting to the governor, according to Defense One. 
The National Guard was used more in 2020 than during the Second World War, as members assisted with wildfires, domestic unrest, and to administrator COVID-19 vaccinations, Defense One reported.   
'We are getting to this point where the federal government and state governments are essentially fighting over who has control of the force,' managing partner of Tully Rinckey law firm Anthony Kuhn told Defense One. 
Kuhn also said he was not surprised the Army decided to cut funding for soldiers and Guardsman who remain unvaccinated. 
'It's kind of a backdoor way to force this policy on the states,' he told Defense One. 
Soldiers choosing to remain unvaccinated will be allowed to leave the military under a disability evaluation, retirement, resignation, or separation after completion of service, the Army reported. 
The Air Force required all active-duty and Space Force Guardians to be vaccinated by November 2. The Air Force Reserve has until December 2. 
The Air Force is 96.4 per cent fully vaccinated with almost 450,000 members vaccinated already immunized. 
An airman, 22, who asked to remain anonymous an is vaccinated, told DailyMail.com that they feel, in their opinion, that 'get vaccinated or get out' is 'completely normal' in the military.
'I feel like the ""get out or get vaccinated"" is completely normal for the military. It is an order to get vaccinated and if you choose to not get the vaccine (other than the normal religious or medical exemptions) you should understand that you will get kicked out.
'That's how the military works, you get an order and you do it.'  
The Navy - the most vaccinated branch of the military where 96.7% of active-duty sailors have had the shot - has also announced that it will be discharging all soldiers who refuse to get vaccinated. 
Sailors who fail to get vaccinated will be given the lowest honorable discharge, which could eliminate their eligibility for some veteran benefits, the Navy Times reported. 
Active-duty sailors have until November 28 to get fully vaccinated, while the Navy Reserves have until December 14. 
Those who are denied medical exemptions will have five days to start the vaccination or separation process, Fox News reported. 
No religious exemptions have been accepted and only six medical have been approved, the Navy Times reported.  
Soldiers will also not receive bonuses, special pays, or incentive pays because 'when a Navy service member refusing the vaccine [they are[ no longer performing duties for which they are receiving such' incentives. 
Members of the Marine Corps, which is a part of the Navy, have until November 28 to get vaccinated, and the Marine Reserves has until December 28. 
The Navy Department announced they will treat Marines 'in a respectful manner' and are 'not going to all kick them out on the day,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told Task and Purpose. 
'We will be addressing each case on a case-by-case basis,' he said. 
'We’re going to try find out what’s their problem and holdup in getting the vaccine, try to counsel them the best we can, offer them an opportunity to change their mind with regards to the vaccinations,' Del Toro told Task and Purpose. 
'Hopefully, they’ll get the vaccination at that point in time. And if they don’t, obviously, then they’re not going to be able to continue serving in the Marine Corps.' 
More than 180,000 Marines have been fully vaccinated.  ",-2
143,"A five-year-old girl is lucky to be alive after being pulled unconcious from the water at a popular Perth amusement park.
Paramedics were called to the Adventure World amusement park in Bibra Lake at 12.15pm on Saturday.
Members of the public pulled the girl who was found face down and unconscious in the water before life guards performed CPR after she stopped breathing. 
She regained consciousness and was taken to Fiona Stanley Hospital in a critical condition. 
Adventure World chief executive Andrew Sharry thanked the two park guests who played a 'pivotal role' in saving her life, according to The West Australian. 
'Early this afternoon an unsupervised five-year-old girl was retrieved from the main pool by the two closest guests,' he said.
'Our lifeguard checked vitals and commenced CPR immediately. Our First Response Team arrived and provided further support.
'The girl responded within moments and was then stabilised until the ambulance arrived.' 
She was later transported to Perth's Children Hospital and is now in a stable condition. 
A witness has described the incident as 'horrible', according to Perth Now. 
'A young girl, she was helped and fortunately taken to hospital breathing,' Sarah Louise wrote via social media. 
'The life guards and members of the public did a great job.
'Was a horrible scene.' 
Under the amusement park's policy children aged under 12 must be supervised at all times by a guardian.   
'Our thoughts are with the young girl and her family,' Mr Sharry said.
'We have reached out to the parents to offer our support.' 
Hundreds of children and their families were reportedly at the popular amusement park during the time of the incident. 
Adventure World continued to remain open to the public after the incident.",-2
144,"Ant and Dec and their band of 'I'm a Celebrity' stars have been given a hearty welcome back to North Wales in the eve of the 20th anniversary of the hit show, despite opposition from some locals.
The TV presenters were surprised by a banner held over a motorway leading to Abergele which urged them to 'go home'.
There has also been unhappiness against the celebrity circus on local bulletin boards from residents concerned that the increased number of visitors will mean traffic snarl ups as roads have been closed with traffic speeds limited and footpaths sealed off.
A woman died outside the castle in a road accident while trying to take a picture of the monument last year leading to safety fears over fans.
But businesses and local residents in the Welsh town have hit back and come out in favour of the pair bringing their show back to Gwrych Castle for the second consecutive year after seeing visitor numbers increase by 50 per cent.
As these pictures show, along with Christmas decorations locals have been busy erecting banners, cardboard cut outs and photographs welcoming the duo, who usually broadcast from the Australian jungle, back.
Les Light who owns Ready Grass in Abergele has placed two giant cardboard cut outs of the Geordie stars next to a throne and two giant sized balloons.
He said: 'These guys are good for putting the area on the national map as well as bringing more visitors into the pubs here.'
At the local butchers Kitchens of Abergele, store assistant Dawn Williams said: 'I think it is wonderful they are back here.
'Most people love them and the attention it brings. We have put their faces in our window as well as those of the 10 contestants. It is going to be a great celebration of our castle and our market town.'
Butcher Darren King added: 'Everyone here has the programme on their lips and wish them luck. '
Retired tax consultant Sarah Frost, 82, said: 'These are lovely people who exude such charm on our television sets. It is wonderful to think that Ant and Dec are in our town.
'I just wish they would take a walk down the High Street and meet everyone. They couldn't last year because of Covid restrictions. I do hope they can this time round.'
But she added: 'I would rather like to meet the footballer David (Ginola) though. He has such beautiful Gallic eyes. They are eyes that can easily seduce…but I must be getting along.'
The barmaid at the George and Dragon Clare Stanton ,48, who is originally from Kent, added: 'I would love Ant to come here and pull a pint for the regulars. It would make their day.
'The show is very popular around here. It is good for everyone that people around the country get to see Abergele filmed and talked about.
'We are all trying to find out who put that banner up on the bridge. I think it might have been a prank and somebody trying to have a laugh. It wasn't remotely funny. We love Ant and Dec. They are national institutions.'
Conwy councillor Goronwy Edwards, said: ' it has been a very difficult year for the businesses here.
'They are keen to take advantage of the new trade that this show will bring to the area and good luck to them. It should boost the local economy.
'There have been some worries about traffic. But we are better prepared this year as we have had more time.
'There has been a few people who do not agree with having the show here and all the attention that it brings. But I think the attention that it does bring is very positive.
'People have been coming here from all over Britain to have their pictures taken outside the castle. They want to be part of the show and so do the local people.'",-2
145,"Colombia's President Ivan Duque apologised on Friday after police cadets dressed up as Nazis for a 'cultural exchange' event in honour of Germany.
Photos of the ceremony were shared Thursday on an official police Twitter account.
In it, students are seen dressed in the grey-green uniform of the Wehrmacht, one of them sporting a small, Adolf Hitler-style moustache.
Others are dressed in the black uniform of the SS, complete with the red swastika armband.
The black, red and yellow German flag and balloons in the same colours decorated the venue that also featured a replica Luftwaffe plane, copies of Nazi firearms, and swastikas on the table cloths.
Two police officers in Colombian uniforms inaugurated the event by cutting a ribbon, the pictures showed.
'From the SimonBolivar police academy in the city of Tulua, we are organising an #InternationalWeek with guest country #Germany. 
'With these cultural exchanges, we are strengthening the knowledge of our police students,' proclaimed the police Twitter account.
The photos were met with a mixture of anger and incredulity on social media, provoking deep embarrassment for the authorities.
'Any apology for Nazism is unacceptable and I condemn any demonstration that uses or refers to symbols referring to those responsible for the Jewish Holocaust that claimed the lives of more than 6 million people,' Duque said on Twitter on Friday.
The police dismissed the head of the academy.
The Defense Ministry, under whose umbrella the Colombian police falls, said in a statement that its training guidelines 'do not envisage in any way an activity such as the one which took place yesterday.'
The German and Israeli embassies in Bogota issued a joint statement expressing 'total rejection of any form of apology or demonstration of Nazism.'
Under fire internationally for its brutal suppression of anti-government protests earlier this year, the Colombian police has embarked on a 'transformation' campaign to improve its image, which will include a uniform change.",-2

Scotland Yard said they would like to talk to Connor Donoghue and Jack Marks following the incident on Brick Lane, Shoreditch, at approximately 3.30am on July 25. 
The victim, who is a 34-year-old man, was hit in the face by the metal object by three men. 
The victim suffered serious facial injuries which required reconstructive surgery.

147,"Australia's vaccine rollout has eclipsed the US and Britain and reached a rare global milestone - but it still has a long way from being the world's most vaccinated nation.
Nearly 82 per cent of Australians aged 12 and over are fully vaccinated, just ahead of Britain (80 per cent) and well in front of the US (69 per cent). 
Looking at the proportion of the total population vaccinated, Australia cracked the 70 per cent mark which only 25 of 195 nations have reached, putting it well ahead of Britain (67.5 per cent) and US (57.67 per cent).
But if there was a league table of the most vaccinated nations, it would be a modest 25th. Britain would rank 30th and the US well down such a list at 64th.
Singapore has (92 per cent) has the highest proportion of vaccinated residents, ahead of United Arab Emirates (88.4 per cent).
Portugal (87.8 per cent), Malta (83.5 per cent) and Chile (82 per cent) round out the top five.
Far fewer Covid-19 cases were recorded in Australia than Britain or the US due to border closures, but experts are in no doubt the fast, though delayed, vaccine rollout prevented the Delta outbreak causing far more deaths and serious illness.
Australian National University professor Peter Collignon said high vaccination rates alone don't guarantee a country freedom from a Covid catastrophe.
Another factor includes how much Covid is circulating in the community when a vaccine rollout begins.
1- Singapore 92% of people are fully vaccinated 
2- United Arab Emirates 88.4%
3- Portugal 87.8% 
4- Malta 83.5%
5- Chile 82%
6- Iceland 81.5%

The more virus circulating, the bigger the job to reverse new Covid infections - and the more hospitalisation and pressure on the healthcare system.
That is how Australia appears to have escaped outbreaks anywhere near nations like the US, which has recorded a chilling 762,000 deaths, or the UK, where 143,000 people have died.
Australia closed the borders back in March 2020, making it much simpler to identify the source of Covid that did come in and buying time without thousands of cases.
'It's a mix of Covid circulation and vaccination, but generally where you have a higher vaccination rate, you have a lower per capita death rate,' Professor Collignon said.
Australia's impressive 12+ vaccination rate - 17.8 million of 21.9 million eligible people - was driven by the state with the highest vaccine take-up, NSW.
In NSW, a remarkable 90 per cent of over-12s are vaccinated.
Experts said Australia surpassed Britain and the US because the public responded to the call to vaccinate when the Delta variant hit.
If Australians had concerns about taking the vaccines, they seemed to decide it was for the best - despite reluctance and fears over AstraZeneca.
'Australians have a history of being fairly pro-vaccination,' Professor Collignon said.
Deakin University chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett said Australia's only real problem was the queue was too long.
'We never really had much vaccine hesitancy, there was some, but we had a look at what was happening overseas and we could see the serious side effects were very very rare,' she said. 
'When you contrast Australia with the complexities of the US, where there is so much talk about individual rights taking precedence. Here there seems to be enough of an understanding of individual and community protections being balanced.'
Australia's vaccination rollout began in February 2021, two months after Britain and the US, and took months longer to ramp up due to scarce supply.
Because of low case numbers and an accompanying sense of complacency, the number of Covid-19 vaccinations administered Down Under was sluggish for months.
The drip-feed of vaccine supplies meant it took until Sydney's Delta outbreak rapidly increased new infections in July for a sense of real urgency in both vaccine supplies and vaccination messaging.
Professor Bennett said experts overseas where asking 'what is Australia doing?' in mid 2021, especially with the wide focus on 'strange' Covid zero policies.
'When NSW went into lockdown we had to vaccinate our way out of it. That was the big shift,' she said.
From there, Australia's rollout was among the fastest in the world, which health officials said contributed to Covid-19 not becoming the catastrophe it was in countries such as India and the US.
In the US, high rates of Covid in the community and vaccine hesitancy meant new infections remain stubbornly high - especially in areas of low vaccination.
Hospitalisations and deaths in parts of the US with strong vaccine resistance have not improved much in the past year, Professor Bennett said.
While Australia is confidently reopening, the virus is causing huge political waves in the US. 
In many states, attempts to enforce restrictions placed on individuals to try to slow virus spread are wildly unpopular with tens of millions of residents.  
As a result, the the US Covid-19 vaccination program has slowed and attempts to introduce Covid restrictions ended the careers of hundreds of senior health officials.
Waning vaccination effectiveness, or a shortage of boosters, is not believed to be a leading factor in US deaths remaining high.
That is because low vaccination rates and resistance to the kind of health orders Australians grudgingly accepted before jab rates improved - such as lockdowns and mask mandates - meant the spread was never fully controlled.
A new definition of being 'fully vaccinated' could be around the corner for Australia and all nations fighting Covid-19.
It would shift from meaning you've had two shots to having your booster up to date.
'We may well move to a new definition of ""fully vaccinated"" that means you were vaccinated no more than seven months ago,' Professor Emma McBryde, an epidemiologist at James Cook University said.
That looks set to a global change too.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged said the definition of fully vaccinated would have to be adjusted to account for third Covid-19 shot, although he did not give a timeframe for the move. 
Whether that means six monthly boosters or a once-off third jab is yet to be decided, Professor Collignon said.
'We don't know the answer to that question yet.'
That is likely to be decided once immunity and hospitalisation rates have been analysed from the third shots starting to be administered worldwide.
'We should know in about a year,'  Professor Collignon said.
'That’s when we’ll know you're know whether a third shot will give you enough immunity for another five to 10 years, or whether you'd need one every six months.' 
For now, health advice is the protection against serious illness of vaccines wanes after seven months.
That means after that time people are advised to have a third vaccination to remain fully protected against Covid-19. 
'Third shots have a marginal gain in terms of protecting people, nowhere near as much as from first and second shot, both as an individual and as a society,' Professor Collignon said.
'Stopping Covid is about the first and second shot - it’s the unvaccinated that the real problem.'
Professor Bennett added: 'They (the US) just never got the numbers down like we did.'
Cases remain high in the UK, but its hospitalisations and deaths are about a quarter of their peak last winter.
Like the US, Britain had a huge spread of the virus before its vaccine rollout commenced. The UK also quickly hit lockdown fatigue.
'Australia took more precautions and we quickly had higher vaccination rates and those two things together worked put us in a better position,' Professor Bennett said.
Professor McBryde agreed: 'Overall, Australians have been incredibly compliant with all public health expectations.
'We are generally good at vaccination, for example childhood immunisations rates over 90 per cent. 
'We have some hefty incentives - carrot and stick - in place. We have great logistics with GPs already delivering millions of vaccines per year and additional funding of state run clinics.' 
Professor Bennett said the unsung heroes of Australia's vaccine rollout were community leaders in Sydney and Melbourne hotspots where the virus spread quickest, and where vaccine take-up was slowest initially.
Those included north Melbourne suburbs like Hume, Whittlesea, and Craigieburn and southwest Sydney suburbs like Blacktown, Bankstown, and Fairfield.
'Absolutely they were the heroes,' she said.
'Many of those suburbs had vaccination rates increasing at nine and 10 per cent a week, which is extraordinary.
'They lifted vaccination rates from 50 per cent to 90 per cent in a matter of weeks, it was incredible and it shows the strength of their leadership.' 
Professor Bennett said mandatory vaccination programs for workers in healthcare settings, and to stop community spread, also played a significant role. 
But even before the rollout, the scale of Australia's Covid problems did not compare to Britain and especially the US.
Even at the height of Australia's Delta outbreak, daily case numbers and death rates never approached what those nations faced.
In the US, more than 762,000 people have died, while in the UK the death toll is over 143,000. The total number of deaths in Australia through the whole pandemic period is just 1,907. 
On January 11, the US peaked with more than 252,000 cases a day, while Britain's peak of 59,000 cases came two days earlier.
The US is still seeing over 80,000 new infection a day and in the UK the number is over 35,000. 
Australia's peak came on October 13, when just 2,306 cases were recorded. The vaccination rollout was progressing rapidly before Australia reached 2,000 cases.
As the pandemic went on, experts said the correlation between vaccination rates, and hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 has become clearer.
This was especially clear when deaths and serious illness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people were compared. 
Being fully vaccinated reduces by more than 90 per cent the risk of having a severe Covid-19 infection, falling to 60 to 70 per cent even six months after vaccination.
Although vaccination rates in Britain and especially the US are lower than hoped, experts crunched the numbers to calculate how many lives were saved by vaccination.
In the In the US, it is believed vaccination saved at least 140,000 lives and more than 100,000 in the UK.
While there has been news coverage of waning vaccine effectiveness after six months in some countries, the first two shots could remain effective enough to last Australia through summer due to the delayed rollout.
'If case numbers stay low and even drop it could be that the very low risks of transmission mean the booster program isn't such a priority and it's actually smarter to save it for Autumn,' Professor Bennett said.
'Everybody is still watching to see what happens around the world with boosters in places like Singapore.'",-2
148,"Annastacia Palaszczuk was the target of a vicious slur from a fired up protestor at an  anti-lockdown march in Brisbane. 
A large crowd gathered at the Botanic Garden on Saturday as part of a co-ordinated nationwide protest against pandemic laws and vaccine mandates. 
During the protest, which was streamed on Facebook by attendee Justin Allen from the Botanic Gardens, a man could be heard yelling 'hang the b*tch'. 

The remark came after announcers asked the crowd what they thought of Ms Palaszczuk. 
There were other ugly scenes at the event, including a man toting a noose.
Announcers were seen asking the man clutching the noose to take it back to his car, telling him in no uncertain terms to 'take that crap down … this is not the place for stuff like that' before adding 'we don't want that crap here.'
The move was widely applauded by the majority of attendees.
Former MP Clive Palmer spoke at the rally in Brisbane, telling the crowd not to vote for major political parties at the next election.
He criticised a number of politicians, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison who he said has 'abandoned Australia'.
The ugly threat directed at the Queensland Premier comes after local MP Brittany Lauga contacted police this week after she and other members of state parliament received an email with 'threats of terrorism, extremism and violence'.
'I understand local doctors have been sent death threats and other threatening letters,' she wrote on Twitter.
'I unequivocally condemn these threats of violence, terrorism and extremism.'
Saturday incident in the heart of Brisbane involving the threat to Ms Palaszczuk followed a similar protest in Melbourne this week.
A gallows and noose were strategically placed outside Victorian parliament, with a prop of Premier Daniel Andrews nearby.
Mr Andrews was unimpressed by the stunt and called out the Prime Minister for pandering to extremists.
He told Channel 9 he has been subjected to personal threats, with his wife and kids also caught up in the drama. 
Mr Morrison on Friday condemned the protests, but 'understood' why scores of protesters were frustrated.
'I don't have sympathy for violence, I don't have sympathy for threats,' he said.
'I have sympathy for Australians who have had a gutful of governments telling them what to do over the last two years.'
Earlier on Saturday, anti-coronavirus vaccine mandate protests drew large crowds across Australia, with tens of thousands marching through city streets.
The rallies, purportedly part of a global 'freedom' movement, were also widely attended in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide.
In Melbourne, a crowd began to mass outside Victoria's parliament before midday and walked to Flagstaff Gardens.
The demonstrators opposed Covid-19 vaccines, mandates and the state's proposed pandemic laws, which stalled in the upper house this week.
Watched on by police, they chanted 'kill the bill' and yelled 'sack Dan Andrews' while carrying placards featuring a range of anti-government and anti-vaccine mandate slogans.
The crowd grew to several thousand at the gardens, where a band played John Farnham's You're the Voice.
In Sydney, police say about 10,000 protesters marched through the city centre to voice their concerns, while smaller, unauthorised protests also took place at Newtown and Newcastle.
No arrests were made and no infringement notices were issued.
'Overall, the protests were conducted peacefully with minimal disruption to the community, and I'm pleased to see that the vast majority of people complied with police directions,' NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell said.
The sound of bagpipes echoed through York St in Sydney's CBD as a man dressed in white screamed 'destroy the new world order' and others chanted 'walk with us'.
United Australia Party leader and federal MP Craig Kelly addressed the crowd at Martin Place after attending a Melbourne protest last weekend.
'We will hold every politician and every bureaucrat responsible for forcing injections upon the Australia population,' he said, drawing chants of 'sack them all'.",-2
149,"Schoolies has well and truly kicked off on the Gold Coast as thousands of teenagers flock to the city for a week of partying.
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
With a kiss and a hug goodbye to mum, many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning.
Others had already gone to the local supermarket to stock up on food and drinks for the week ahead.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",-2

151,"Kyle Rittenhouse, who was found not guilty on all charges Friday in a controversial trial that has divided the nation, may possibly have a defamation case against President Joe Biden over reference to 'white supremacists' in a video, experts said. 
The video was posted in a September 2020 tweet, which could now possibly cause Biden legal trouble, according to lawyer Todd McMurtry, who helped Nicolas Sandmann sue news outlets for upward of $800 million for defamation. The now-19-year-old famously settled with CNN and The Washington Post after they deemed him a racist when he was seen in viral video footage wearing a MAGA hat.
Biden, 79, tweeted on September 30, 2020: 'There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States [Donald Trump] refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night.' 
Although Trump was not asked specifically about Rittenhouse's actions on the debate stage at the time, the 18-year-old was featured in the tweeted video holding a rifle in the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020.
'What you take from this tweet is that Kyle Rittenhouse was using his rifle and engaging in white supremacist misconduct, so it's actionable,' McMurtry told Fox News on Friday after Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges against him.
The lawyer admitted the 18-year-old was 'not necessarily going to win' but it is 'actionable.' 
Civil rights lawyer Leo Terrell warned Biden on Fox News that the now-president couldn't justify his remarks and that he's 'going to have to pay for and justify' his actions. 
Biden released a statement following the verdict Friday, saying: 'While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken.' 
The president also said he knew 'we're not going to heal our country's wounds overnight' but he remains 'committed' to doing 'everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally.' 
Vice President Kamala Harris also told reporters that the 'verdict speaks for itself.'
‘It’s clear, there’s still a lot more work to do,' she said before boarding Air Force One in Columbus, Ohio.  
McMurtry also argues that Sandmann and Rittenhouse have similar cases: both were minors when the event occurred and were private figures at the time. 
Although household names now, without being public figures or celebrities beforehand, Rittenhouse and Sandmann only have to prove Biden's negligence, instead of a higher burden of proof actual malice, the lawyer said.
Sandmann has also encouraged Rittenhouse to sue media outlets for defamation as well. 
'The parallels between me and Rittenhouse are impossible not to draw,' Sandmann wrote in an op-ed for DailyMail.com. 'The attacks on Kyle came from the national news media, just as they came for me.
'So every single label on Kyle as a 'terrorist', 'white supremacist', and 'school shooter' in the streets of Kenosha, will only ever be withdrawn after the damage has been done.
'So, if Kyle is prepared to take on another burden in his early life, with the acceptance that it might result in nothing, I answer, give it a shot and hold the media accountable,' he wrote for DailyMail.com. 
Sandmann sued CNN after it covered the viral moment of him staring down a Native American playing traditional music on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial while the teen wore a MAGA hat.   
He also won a lawsuit against the Washington Post in June 2020 for an undisclosed amount.  
Sandmann told Sean Hannity on Fox News Channel that he is still currently suing six media outlets and the proceedings are ongoing.  
McMurtry thinks Rittenhouse may have a case against MSNBC.  
'I think Rittenhouse may be able to do the same thing when commentators on MSNBC say he's a school shooter, a white supremacist, even a vigilante.
'Lots of media people said he was a murderer, and I think that's actionable because that suggests that he committed a crime, and we now know that he didn't. When you just throw this stuff out there, you take risks.' 
Rittenhouse's mother Wendy also spoke to Hannity shortly after her son cried on the stand. 
When asked about Biden referring to son as a white supremacist, she said: 'When I saw that, I was in shock, I was angry. President Biden doesn't know my son.' 
She later claimed that Biden 'did it for the votes' and that he 'defamed' her son.  
She also admitted her son 'had nightmares from this' and has 'a lot of healing to do.'   
Rittenhouse was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on August 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 
Rittenhouse will also appear on Fox Monday to talk with Tucker Carlson and it was revealed that Fox Nation filmed a documentary during his trial that will air in December.  ",-2
152,"A federal judge has blamed the former president for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot, saying that Donald Trump 'created the conditions' for the unrest with his 'lies.'
Judge Amit Mehta, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, indirectly invoked the president's name Friday when sentencing John Lolos to 14 days in jail for his role in the deadly demonstration.
'The fact remains that he and others were called to Washington, DC, by an elected official, prompted to walk to the Capitol by an elected official,' Mehta said.
'People like Mr. Lolos were told lies, were told falsehoods, were told the election was stolen when it was not,' Mehta added, calling Lolos a 'pawn,' according to CNN.  
Mehta appears to be the first judge to hold Trump responsible in a Capitol riot case. 
Judge Mehta, 50, was born in India and attended Georgetown University and the University of Virginia Law School. He was appointed by former President Barack Obama in July 2014 and confirmed by the US Senate via voice vote in December. 
'Once you hear people who should know better tell you that an election was stolen and they say it loudly enough, frequently enough, it's not surprising that people will believe it,' the judge said, according to Politico.
Nearly 700 people have been charged in the riot, Insider reports, and 40 have been sentenced. 
Lolos was sentenced to 14 days in jail and was ordered to pay $500 in restitution.
Prosecutors say that Lolo was seen in a video leaving the Capitol doorway waving a red 'Trump 2020 Keep America Great' flag hooked together with the United States flag, yelling, 'We did it, yeah!' after an unknown individual yelled, 'We stopped the vote!'
He was arrested after a DC airport officer saw a video of Lolos at the riot on his Instagram feed and noticed him at the airport wearing the same shirt.
At the time, Lolos was waiting for another flight out of DC because he was kicked off the first one after 'continuously yelling ""Trump 2020!""' while the plane was on the tarmac, according to Lolo's charging document.
On Wednesday, a judge sentenced Jacob Chansley, also known as the 'QAnon Shaman,' to nearly three-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the riot, with credit for the 10 months he's already served.
'I admit to the world, I was wrong. I have no excuses. My behavior was indefensible,' he said.
Chansley insisted that he is not a violent man, a domestic terrorist or a 'white supremacist.'
As part of an impassioned 30-minute speech to the court, Chansley quoted Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Jesus, and the prison break film The Shawshank Redemption.
January 6 rioters were hoping to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results in favor of President Joe Biden after President Trump repeatedly said the election had been stolen from him, a claim he continues to make today.
Earlier that day, Trump had given a speech in which he told his supporters, 'If you don’t fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'
The riot resulted in the deaths of five people, including Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer trying to stop a crowd from breaking into the building. 
'Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos who were told those lies took it to heart. And they are the ones paying the consequences,' Judge Mehta said. 
'Those who created the conditions that lead to Mr. Lolos' conduct have in no meaningful measure been held accountable.'
He told Lolos: 'You were a pawn. You were a pawn in the game played by people who know better.'
Various reports of Friday's hearing describe Lolos as 'rambling' or going into an 'extended rant.'
As his defense attorney tried to stop him from talking, he continued to cite debunked election fraud claims, claimed the evidence against him was tainted, and encouraged people listening in on the hearing to look up a video of him online, according to CNN. 
'I may have failed to explain why incarceration is necessary here, but I think Mr. Lolos just summed it up,' prosecutors said.",-2
153,"All flights to and from the Spanish island of La Palma have been cancelled due to ash from the Cumbre Vieja volcano, which has been erupting since September.
Twenty national flights were cancelled on Saturday, said a spokesman for the Spanish airport authority.
Air travel to the island in the Spanish-owned Canaries archipelago, off the Atlantic coast of North Africa, has been regularly affected since the volcano erupted on September 19 for the first time in 50 years.
No one has died in the eruption on the island of 85,000 people, but it caused serious damage and led to the evacuation of more than 7,000 people, with some buildings swallowed by lava flows.
More than 1,000 hectares of land and more than 2,600 buildings were destroyed, according to the European geospatial measurement system, Copernicus.
Provisional damage was estimated on Friday at nearly 900 million euros ($1 billion), according to the region.
During a visit on Friday and Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced new aid for the economy and infrastructure of the island, which depends in particular on tourism and banana cultivation.
The island of La Palma is experiencing its third eruption in a century, after those of the San Juan volcano in 1949 and the Teneguia in 1971.
Scientists have said the latest eruption could last up to three months.
This is not the first time all flights to and from the island have been cancelled, with the same happening earlier this month on November 3.
With flights cancelled, some tourists who went to the island on a sightseeing trip to witness the eruption had to wait in long lines for ferries to leave the island.
Madrid resident, Patricia Privado, 30, described the erupting volcano earlier this month as 'a spectacle of nature'.
'It is worth it,' she said of her trip. 'To hear it roar, to see how the lava falls. You have to experience it.'
Leon Pena, 65, said he came from the nearby island of Fuerteventura to see what he called 'something unique'.
Both said they knew flight cancellations were a possibility, but they didn't let that deter them from traveling to La Palma.
They also saw their trips as a way of supporting the local economy by spending money on the island, which has suffered greatly from the eruption.
Earlier this month, residents were questioning where financial aid promised by the Spanish government was.
In October, the government pledged 225 million euros in aid, and by the start of November, some 21 million euros of that has been disbursed.
Sanchez said at the time his administration would transfer a further 18.8 million euros for the agriculture and fishing industries and 5 million euros to tackle the 'social aspect' of the crisis.
The volcano's constant roar and numerous earthquakes have also kept locals on edge, and earlier in the month fears were again raised over possible toxic gas being released into the air as the second stream of lava reached the Atlantic ocean.
The stream of molten rock , which began erupting in mid-September, reached the water near the popular surf spot of Los Guirres beach on November 1.
A video uploaded by Spain's Geology and Mining Institute at the time showed rivers of molten rock sliding into the sea and large rocks rolling down a cliff, causing a cone of debris to emerge from the waterline.
Unlike the first time lava reached the ocean - just over a month ago - authorities said there was no need for residents to stay indoors.
'New confinements are not necessary because the populations are far away from the point of contact with the sea that occurred last night,' an emergency services spokesperson told Reuters earlier this month.
Few people live in the affected area, which is mostly banana plantations.
Early on in the eruption authorities had feared that the reaction between the superheated lava and seawater could unleash powerful explosions and set off toxic gas clouds.
During the last major eruption on the island, some 50 years ago, a man died after inhaling such gases.
La Palma's council said on Tuesday that seismic activity around the eruption site, as well as emissions of toxic sulphur dioxide, had been decreasing and the air quality remained good across most of the island.",-2
154,"An armored truck spewed cash all over a San Diego freeway this week after one of its doors burst open, and now the FBI and the California Highway Patrol are looking for those who ran off with the money.
'If anyone picked up cash, we ask you to bring it to the office in Vista immediately,' a CHP spokesperson told Fox 5. 'I just want to give everyone a head's up that there is a lot of video evidence.' 
They are giving people 48 hours to return the money or face 'potential criminal charges.' Two people have already been arrested, officials said.
Drivers stopped what they were doing Monday and scrambled to pick up 'free' money on the northbound side of Interstate 5 near Carlsbad, California. 
The trunk was on its way to the Federal Reserve to make the deposit when the back doors burst open around 10 a.m., authorities said. 
The FBI and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) are now looking for people who took the money, after already arresting two people who got locked out of their car during the frenzy. It is unknown how much money came out of the trunk, nor how much is still missing.
Fitness guru Demi Bagby, from San Diego, was identified as one of the persons of interest after she posted a video to her Instagram account showing her and her friends picking up money. 
'This is the most insane thing I've ever seen, someone dropped money all over the freeway and San Diego has shut down, literally it has shut down. Look at the freeway right now, oh my gosh,' Bagby says in a video she posted for her 2.5 million followers. 
'Literally everyone stopped on the freeway to get money off the freeway. This is insane,' she says.  
The video also showed others with huge stacks of cash in their hands, as well as two other women who were seen picking up cash. The FBI released screenshots of Bagby's video and are wanting to talk to those featured in it. 
Another driver even covered up their license plate with what appears to be a white towel to avoid being identified. 
As Bagby and her friends drove past the armored trunk, it appeared that its drivers had left the scene. The drivers of the truck were seen earlier talking to the police. 
Another driver, Travis Fisher, told Fox 5 that he thought there was an accident before noticing the money. 
'I see all these things floating around and I realize it’s money,' Fisher told Fox 5. 'It was pretty crazy. Just everywhere, there was a sea of bills, everywhere.' 
Fisher estimated there were thousands of dollars scattered across the roadway. 
CHP and the FBI are now calling on those who took the money to return it, as it's a crime to steal government property. 
Police collected the fallen money in garbage bags but even after they cleared the scene, some stragglers still stayed behind in search for more. 
Lawyer Greg Wiseman told Fox 5 that the 'finder's keepers' attitude won't get them very far. 
'People get the wrong idea, they think ""finder's keepers,"" they think ""possession is nine-tenths of a law,"" but that's not the law,' he said. 
He said the 'negligent' act does not 'create a windfall where people just get to say ""right place, right time"" and keep the money.' 
Many commenters slammed Bagby and her friends for filming themselves and other people, with one stating: 'This video will have you in court lmaoooo [sic] they track these people down.' 
Another also warned the fitness guru not to 'brag' about her gold mine: 'I wouldn't of bragged on camera about taking money if I were those people.' 
The influencer herself even commented: 'Who's coming to sizzler with us tonight?' Sizzler is a restaurant chain that was founded in California. 
Other commenters focused on the driver of the vehicle, writing: 'Someone's getting fired.' 
While others just wished it was them, one even asked for someone to come to the East Coast and 'drop some bills.' 
'Damn someone come to the east coast and drop some bills for us!' 
Another wrote: 'The only time you wish you were stuck on the freeway! send us all some.' 
It is unknown if Bagby and her friends are still in possession of the money.  
Stealing government property can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine.  
The FBI and CHP are investigating.

155,"A centuries-old Charles Dickens letter written in code has been offered up to the public to help solve it - with a cash prize.
The so-called 'Tavistock letter' is one of a number of manuscripts which Dickens wrote in a modified version of brachygraphy - a form of shorthand popular in the 18th century.
Researchers have been stumped by the code and have now turned to amateur cryptographers to try and decipher it, offering a £300 prize to do so before New Year's Eve.
The prize is being offered by the Dickens Code Project led by the University of Leicester and the University of Foggia and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
The letter has never been read despite being one of the ten surviving manuscripts from Dickens after he burned a trove of documents at his Gad's Hill home in Kent.
The blue letter paper of the manuscript is headed with the words 'Tavistock House' the London house where Dickens wrote Bleak House, A Tale of Two Cities and other works.
It is from this heading where the letter has got its name. 
Hugo Bowles, professor of English at the University of Foggia in Italy told The Times: 'It looks simple but really is not.
'You read back the consonants and fill in the gaps.
'It is a little like playing Scrabble in your head.'
'Dickens clearly liked word games and puzzles and would have been very good at them, hence the use of this system.'
Dickens' shorthand system was partially illuminated by researchers using a notebook stored at the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester.
Dr Claire Wood, lecturer in Victorian literature at the University of Leicester, told the Times: '[Dickens] throws out the symbols that are more obscure and that aren't coming up in what he is reporting on. 
'Instead he creates new marks that make more sense and that save him time as a shorthand writer.'
But the genius' messy handwriting still poses a problem for anyone hoping to claim the cash on offer. 
Professor Bowles told The Times that Dickens' messy shorthand has been a major hurdle for the researchers in trying to figure out what the letter actually says.
He said: 'Unfortunately, the notebook is not nearly enough to help us decode everything.
'It gives a few of his extra symbols, which are useful, but a lot of the problem is actually connected to his writing.
'Much like messy handwriting, he has messy shorthand.'
Researchers have employed a series of techniques to try and decipher Dickens' difficult code including finding translated pieces and working backwards and also employing machine learning.
Both techniques have failed due to the lack of material on offer to try and figure out patterns.",-2
156,"A tech billionaire allegedly kept a spreadsheet of 5,000 women he has had sex with, one of them a teenager he paid off to keep quiet, despite losing his high-profile job over a sexual misconduct allegation in 2016.
Michael Goguen, 57, a former partner at Sequoia Capital who now heads his own firm, has been sued by four former employees who say they helped manage his 'harem' of women.
The explosive lawsuit claims the investor met with the women at various safe houses or at a 'boom boom' room in the basement of his bar in Whitefish, a small town in Montana where he now lives.
The married billionaire, who has two children, once asked his employee to arrange a hit on a former friend who knew too much about his personal life, according to the lawsuit. 
A retired Whitefish police chief now says that Goguen - whom he compared to serial predators Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein - 'has to be stopped.'
These are the latest allegations of sexual impropriety leveled against Goguen, who in 2016 was accused of 'countless hours of forced sodomy' by his former girlfriend, exotic dancer Amber Baptiste.
The latest 135-page lawsuit was filed in February by former employees of Goguen’s Amyntor Group LLC, a security contractor, according to the New York Post.
It lays out a complex operation headed by Goguen to protect his simultaneous affairs. The breakdown of the operation, and the employees who helped it run, can be traced through multiple guilty pleas by former employees and associates who threatened to speak out about the alleged scheme.
Among the plaintiffs is Matthew Marshall, the former head of Amyntor who quickly grew to become Goguen's 'right-hand man.' 
Marshall pled guilty to wire fraud and other charges earlier this month after he pretended to be an elite member of the Marine Corps and asked Goguen for money for 'off the books' missions, according to the Flathead Beacon.
But Marshall says Goguen, who is currently married to his fourth wife, allegedly kept a 'harem' of 'numerous women, including married women, strippers, and prostitutes,' who he bought homes for and used for 'illicit sexual activity.' 
Goguen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. 
The tech investor is worth more than $5 billion, according to the New York Post. 
He flew some of the women in his private $42 million jet. 
'Marshall was being asked to purchase, out of his personal accounts, vehicles, jewelry, earnest money deposits on properties, and to provide cash or other items for Goguen’s mistresses, or as hush-money payoffs to Goguen’s acquaintances and employees who had ""learned too much"" about Goguen’s sexual misconduct and crimes, and the Goguen Sexual Scheme,' the lawsuit states.
'Goguen informed Marshall it was best to have him pay the property expenses, especially any expenses that were solely for Goguen’s safe houses, out of his personal account to avoid his then wife Jordana from discovering that Goguen owned a number of properties that he used extensively for extramarital affairs because Jordana had visibility over Goguen’s accounts at that time.'
The lawsuit, which is asking for $800 million in damages, claims various violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) act. 
It accuses Goguen of offering 'gifts' to the women - including alcohol, travel, jewelry, cash and health care expenses - 'to perform other deviant sexual acts with him, and/or to maintain their silence as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.' 
He gave one woman a credit card and bought her a five-bedroom home after her husband, a prominent businessman, found out about their affair and began divorce proceedings, according to the Post. 
Goguen also allegedly gave Eric Payne, who did construction for Goguen, an office in the basement of Casey's Bar, an establishment that he owns in Whitefish.
The office 'was passcode protected, had a built-in full size stripper pole, and commonly referred to as the ""boom boom"" room where he and Payne could procure young women to engage in sexual acts with them for money, drugs or other items of value as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.'
Goguen was vindictive against those who tried to put a stop to his nefarious activities, according to the lawsuit viewed by DailyMail.com.
His friend Bryan Nash called him a 'pedophile' after Goguen brought his two daughters to Nash's house but later absconded with their high-school-aged babysitter to have sex with her in a cottage on the property. 
The age of the babysitter is not clear. 
'Goguen threatened to kill Nash if he “said anything to anybody” about his “character flaw,” later telling Nash that he “owns Montana” and “supplies law enforcement,'"" the lawsuit states.
Goguen then began having sex with Nash's wife and paying for her divorce proceedings, allegedly costing Nash more money in a drawn out legal battle.
He used Marshall to investigate and harass Nash, who went to authorities 'to no avail,' the lawsuit states. 
In September 2014, Goguen texted Marshall using the encrypted texting service Wickr, writing: 'Nashf*** has pushed me too far and his occasional reminders he might help blow the lid off my personal life requires an extreme response. The cyber route isn't having the impact on him that I was hoping to achieve,' according to the lawsuit.
'Buddy, he’s f*****with my life, career, etc. and the potential for me being destroyed if he gets traction with the authorities or press is significant. This requires an extreme response. He will f***** destroy the ""bigger picture"" for us if he's not stopped. 
'He needs to be killed. I know that's a VERY big ask but we are in defcon 5. We can discuss details in person but we do NOT have conversations about this on our cell phones. Wickr only…'
Marshall did not try to have Nash killed, the lawsuit states.
In May 2020, Nash pled guilty to one count of blackmail after prosecutors say he threatened to release negative information about Goguen if he didn't pay him $250,000 to cover his divorce proceedings, according to the Flathead Beacon. 
Goguen is from Bedford, Massachusetts, according to the Post. 
He went to Cornell and Stanford universities, where he studied electrical engineering, and joined Sequoia Capital - an early investor in Google, YouTube and PayPal - in 1996, according to his LinkedIn.
He was let go from his job at Sequoia after Amber Baptiste accused him of physical and sexual assault over a 13-year period after he picked her up at a Texas strip club, according to the Post.
She said he sodomized her for 'six hours at a time' and forced her to call him 'king' and 'emperor' in a lawsuit asking for $40 million.
Goguen then told Marshall to act as his 'general 100x more aggressive than Patton was, to coordinate and make sure everything is happening that should be happening — PR firms, private investigators criminal side, local PR, everything,' according to February's lawsuit, emphasizing the lengths he was willing to go to, and the money he was wiling to spend, to punish those who hurt him. 
Back in 2016, Sequoia called Baptiste's allegations 'unproven and unrelated to Sequoia' but said that Goguen's departure 'was the appropriate course of action.'
In 2019, a judge dismissed Baptiste's lawsuit for failing to provide relevant documents or to submit to a medical examination, according to TechCrunch. 
A different judge then found that Baptiste committed fraud and extortion and granted Goguen a restraining order preventing her from repeating her claims, according to the Flathead Beacon.
The latest lawsuit does not name any of the allegedly 100 women in Goguen's 'harem.'
It does note, however, that he's bought some of them homes, including a multi-million dollar home in Santa Monica, California for a woman whom he allegedly got pregnant multiple times but paid to have abortions. 
Retired Whitefish Police chief Bill Dial, who is also suing Goguen, told the Post: 'This man has to be stopped. He’s a billionaire a la Harvey Weinstein and Epstein. There's a lot of people in this community who know what he’s about and they’re afraid of him.'
Goguen's employees say that a detective by the name of Shane Erickson was 'forced to resign' after failing to investigate sexual assault allegations against Goguen while 'improperly accepting gifts and other compensation' from him.
'Mr. Erickson was forced to resign from his position as a Police Detective with the Whitefish Police Department for failing to investigate the alleged conduct by Goguen and improperly accepting gifts and other compensation from Defendant Goguen while employed with the Whitefish Police Department,' the lawsuit states.
The teenager, identified only as Pam Doe, was given alcohol and cocaine by Goguen, Payne and a third individual, the lawsuit states.
In an email she wrote to her lawyer, she said she had been asked to pop out of a cake at a party when she was 17, wherein after she was 'roofied' and asked to be an 'escort,' to multiple men.
During the course of his investigation, Erickson told Marshall that Goguen admitted he paid her $1,200 to have sex with him. 
'During the course of April, May and June 2018, Det. Erickson openly shared with Marshall the fact that he was spending time with Goguen, including having dinner at his house, spending time on Whitefish lake, going on a coyote hunt and doing other leisure activities with their families,' the lawsuit says, adding that Goguen took Erickson via private jet on his 'yearly week-long ~$20,000 elk hunt in Colorado with private guides.'
Pam Doe eventually recanted her allegations. She was allegedly 'forced to sign a non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreement' and paid off. 
Whitefish police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. ",-2
157,"A gang of 14 thieves stole about $120,00 worth of merchandise in broad daylight from a Chicago-area Louis Vuitton store as the Windy City's rampant crime spreads to its posh suburbs, police said. 
Shocking video shows the gang entering the store at the Oak Brook Center one at a time on Thursday after an armed guard went on a short break.  
Once they were all inside, the thieves pulled out trash bags from their coats and jumped to every corner of the store, stuffing their bags full of designer products. 
Some of the thieves took everything they could carry by hand, and in seconds, they all ran out of the store, located about 18 miles west of downtown Chicago.
So far this year in Chicago, thefts have seen a 14 percent spike, jumping to 11,093 from 9,424 in 2020. 
The guard at the luxury story quickly returned to the scene and tried to stop the gang, but they got away in three separate vehicles, Oak Brook Police told Fox News.
Officers were able to find one of the vehicles, a Dodge Charger, on Friday, which had been reported stolen last month in Chicago. 
The other two vehicles were believed to be a silver Lincoln MKZ and a red sports car.  
Oak Brook Police Chief James Kruger said police now have vehicle and license information on the suspects.
'We're nailing down all those leads now, our detectives are out working those leads,' he told Fox. 
The incident mirrored a robbery at a Louis Vuitton store last month only 30 miles away in Northbrook. 
Northbrook Police said a gang of 13 thieves and three getaway drivers targeted the Louis Vuitton in the Northbrook Court Mall, stealing about $66,000 worth of products on October 7. 
'We don't know if there is a connection yet, but certainly there are similarities and our investigators are talking to their investigators,' Kruger told ABC 7.
Oak Brook police are working with the Illinois attorney general to see if the two robberies are connected. ",-2
158,"A Virginia cop who was fired for anonymously donating $25 to a Kyle Rittenhouse defense fund after being outed by hackers and the media is now demanding his job back from the woke, 'hypocrite' police chief who fired him. 
Speaking to DailyMail.com on Friday, as the Rittenhouse verdict came in on Friday, Norfolk Police Lieutenant William 'Bill' Kelly explained why he thought Rittenhouse deserved his help back then, and why he stands by the decision now. 
Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all counts on Friday after a two week trial. He buckled in tears as the verdict was read aloud and is now a free man. 
Seven months ago, long before the trial had even started, 42-year-old Kelly was fired for donating anonymously to the teenager's then-growing defense fund.  
Kelly, a 19-year veteran and father-of-three who had moved into the internal affairs division at the time, made a $25 donation to a Give Send Go online campaign for Rittenhouse's legal team after watching social media videos and journalists' footage from the August 2020 Kenosha riots. 
He wrote alongside his donation: 'God Bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You’ve done nothing wrong. Every rank-and-file police officer supports you.' 
Scroll down for video 
He thought nothing else of it, until his name appeared in an article by The Guardian among the names of other cops who gave to the fund. Their details had been hacked by a group and provided to the media. Kelly was fired and vilified by the police chief and city manager in Norfolk, who called his actions 'egregious'.  
In an interview with DailyMail.com, he explained why he thought Rittenhouse was innocent from the beginning. 
'Everything I'm saying is just my personal opinion. I've been a homicide detective, a violent crimes investigator for years. I have a background. I watched the video of the shooting and I'd seen the video of the journalists of Mr. Rittenhouse before the shooting and the protesters before the shooting and I thought it painted a pretty clear picture that Mr. Rittenhouse had a very strong claim for self-defense.
'I was very surprised when he was charged soon after the shooting with these murders and the shooting of the third victim,' he said. 
Kelly, a self-confessed 'news junkie', saw that a GoFundMe account for Rittenhouse had been canceled, and a site called Give Send Go had set up another page for him. 
He logged on and donated, making sure to leave out personal details because he says he didn't want to associate himself with the police department. 
'I was interested in giving him the chance to defend himself in front of a jury. I know that lawyers are expensive, and it's hard sometimes to get the message out there. I wanted to make sure that he had the means necessary to make his claim in court.
'It mattered. The comments I made, my belief that he has a strong claim for self-defense was a personal opinion. I didn't want my city or police department to be associated with it, so I chose to donate anonymously.
'It was only after the hackers broke into it that they were able to connect those dots,' he said. 
A hacker group called 'Distributed Denial of Secrets' obtained his name and email address from the fund and provided it to The Guardian, which published a story including his name. The Daily Dot followed. 
Within a day of it coming out, the Norfolk Police Department was receiving widespread calls to fire Kelly from all over the world. 
'It wasn't people local, it was people from all around the country who read an article and sent a nasty tweet. In the absence of that outcry, there would not have been any kind of disciplinary action against me, I'm confident,' he said. 
The city decided that the comments 'eroded' the public's trust in the police and Kelly was fired in April. 
He has since filed a grievance, but the process is ongoing and in the meantime, he's had to survive on his savings. 
Speaking from his home in Norfolk, he said he wishes the city officials had waited at least until tensions surrounding the case had calmed, if not until the trial. 
'If people consumed as much information as I did about the case they may have come to a different conclusion. And honestly even if they did consume as much information as I did and they came to a different conclusion - that's fine. 
'This is America. You can agree with your neighbors and other people in your community and you can disagree with them. Just because someone has a different opinion than you, it doesn't mean you should destroy their lives, take their job away.
'My opinion on the self-defense claim of Mr. Rittenhouse has no impact on my ability to do my job as a police officer.'
He says the only reason he was fired was because he supported the teenager. 
'If I had a different opinion and I donated to a fund for the victims and made comments about how Mr. Rittenhouse was a murderer, nobody would have cared or tried to get me fired.'
In his grievance, he points to the fact that the police chief Larry Boone attended a BLM protest in May last year in full uniform, while on duty. 
In the photo, Boone is holding a sign that reads Black Lives Matter, with the names of people who have been shot by cops - including some in Norfolk - around it. 
'The hypocrisy is dumbfounding. For the leader of our organization to be able to advocate support for a movement that is at the very least divisive in America today, in uniform while on duty... he was holding carried the name of a person who had recently been shot by a Norfolk police officer. 
'The sign demanded justice for that person, but that shooting was still under investigation to determine whether or not that officer should be charged criminally. It's very inconsistent.
'Yet I cannot, off-duty, on my own time make a donation and some comments that are well within the realm of public, acceptable discourse?' 
The bigger issue, he says, is that he was fired for daring to have an opinion that went against woke officials and public pressure to condemn the teenager.  
 'The outcome of the trial has nothing to do with my vindication - right or wrong, an American has the right to express their opinion within the realm of public discourse. 
'That same freedom exists regardless to the outcome.' 
Now, he says the censorship of right-wing political views is 'chilling' police officers all over the country.
They feel 'disposable' unless they submit to a liberal ideology. 
'It made me feel disposable. Not only how it affected me, how it affected other officers. I was contacted by others who said they immediately deleted their social  media accounts after I got fired out of fear that they would go through them and find something innocuous to use against them.
'I've been contacted by officers who say, ""what if Trump runs in 2024 and I put a sign for him in my front yard, can media get a hold of that? If enough people complain, will I lose my job?""
'The effects of this kind of censorship are wide. It ripples through the entire department. It's a chilling effect.'
Kelly and his wife have been surviving on her salary as a school teacher and his savings to get by, but he is hoping he will be reinstated soon and given backpay. 
The couple have three kids, the oldest of whom is 18. 
He is desperate to return to work and was just ten months away from vesting for his pension when he was fired. If he doesn't get his job back, he'll lose the pension he worked almost 20 years for. 
'I love being a cop, it's a part of me and who I am. It was a huge hit to me to lose my  job. If I got the chance again, I'd jump on it,' he said. 
Kelly said that even though Rittenhouse has now been acquitted, he does not believe public discourse will change because people have 'dug in' to their opinions. 
'I don't think the discourse will change. People are dug in on their heels... they'll point to some other boogie-man as an excuse as to why he was acquitted. They won't be forced to look at the facts of the case. I don't think they'll change their mind.
'Honestly, most of America is pretty polarized. People on both sides who seem to be ideologically dug in to their position.
'They try to view fact patterns through it and it's hard to break free from it,' he said. 
The City of Norfolk did not respond to inquiries about whether it intended to give him his job back. 
He is hoping for a hearing date at the end of January, but wants to resolve the issue privately before then.    ",-2
159,"Prince Andrew was pictured riding in Windsor today with just a week to go before the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell on charges of grooming underage girls for now-deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. 
The Duke of York, 61, was joined by a female groom for the early morning ride ahead of a weekend of festivities which will see The Firm descend on Windsor.
 The Queen is said to be determined to attend the joint christenings of her great-grandchildren in Windsor, with other senior members of the royal family including Prince William, Kate Middleton and Prince Charles also likely to be in attendance.
Her Majesty, 95, was forced to cancel her Remembrance Sunday appearance last week following a back sprain and later warned that 'none of us can slow the passage of time' via a speech delivered by the Earl of Wessex after the monarch failed to address the Church of England's national assembly for the first time in her 69-year reign. 
But she has told courtiers she is set on bring present this weekend as her granddaughters  Princess Eugenie, 31,  and Zara Tindall, 40,  christen their first-born sons at the All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park, according to the Sun.
It is believed The Queen will make an '11th-hour decision' and is taking advice from her personal doctor, with a source saying she is 'keen to be there' as she 'knows how important it is' for her children and great-grandchildren.
It's an unusual move for the two royal cousins to have a joint christening, with the royal commentator Penny Junor saying it would be a 'fantastic message to the world that she is not ready to leave us yet.'
'She's very spiritual, a christening is a very important occasion for the head of the Church of England and being there will be of great importance to her,' she added to the Sun.
Many members of the Firm were spotted out today - Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall attended at day at races at Ascot's November weekend while Princess Anne was pictured the Rugby Union autumn International watching Scotland v Japan. 
Princess Eugenie welcomed her son - August Brooksbank - who is 13th in line to the throne, with husband Jack Brooksbank on 9th February at London's Portland Hospital.  
She had planned to christen him in July at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.
However, celebrations were apparently scrapped after a fellow attendee is said to have either tested positive for corornavirus or been pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app minutes before meaning the gathering had to be cancelled. 
Little August - the grandson of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson - will be christened alongside his second cousin, Lucas Tindall - the son of Zara and Mie Tindall and grandson of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips.
Princess Anne's daughter and the former England rugby star welcomed their third child - and first son - in March.
The royal babies will be christened in Holy Water Prince Charles picked up on his recent trip to Jordan.
The Prince of Wales was pictured picking up 'five or six dozen bottles' of Holy water taken from the River Jordan back to the UK for royal baptisms - which could include that of Lilibet, the grand-daughter he has never met.
The water will eventually wend its way back to the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, where Prince Louis was christened. It will also be used for non-royal worshippers at the chapel. 
 Other children set to be christened are Princess Beatrice's new daughter, Sienna Elizabeth. 
It's believed the ceremony will be led by chaplain to Great Windsor Park Canon Martin Poll. 
The church forms part of the Royal Lodge at  Windsor Great House where Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson live and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie grew up.
Andrew's appearance comes amid reports  the Queen’s second son plans to use his military career as a way to return to public life.
 Next year is the 40th anniversary of the conflict in the South Atlantic, which claimed 255 British military lives, and the Duke of York will attend commemorative events in the summer.
‘The Duke is determined to take part in the Falklands commemorations,’ a source told Daily Mail's Richard Eden. ‘The Falklands was a key moment in his life and he wants to honour his fallen comrades. He hopes this could help pave the way for a return to public life.’
Andrew’s withdrew from royal duties two years ago  after the overwhelmingly negative reaction to his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis about his ill-advised friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke on three occasions when she was 17.
However, earlier this month, a U.S. judge set a date in January for Andrew’s bid to have his accuser’s allegations thrown out.
 He has repeatedly and vehemently denied the claims.

1. Savannah Phillips
Ten-year-old Savannah Phillips, who was born in 2010, is the Queen and Philip's eldest great-grandchild.
She is the daughter of the Princess Royal's son, Peter Phillips, and his ex-wife Autumn.
The couple announced they were divorcing in 2020, but share custody and co-parent their children.
At Eugenie's wedding in 2018, bridesmaid Savannah had pageboy Prince George trying to stifle laughter when she entertained him by pretending to play the trumpet in St George's Chapel.
She was also once seen pushing George - her second cousin - down a grassy bank at a polo match, and also putting her hand over his mouth as the National anthem was played while they were on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour.
2. Isla Phillips
Savannah's younger sister, Isla, has just turned nine and was born in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year of 2012.
Her middle name is Elizabeth in honour of the monarch. The Phillips sisters are not entitled to a royal title.
They are usually kept out of the limelight - but sometimes join other members of the family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for major events.
They are mostly spotted enjoying themselves as they play together at horse trials.
3. Prince George
Future king George, born in 2013, is the oldest of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children.
The seven-year-old has spent much of lockdown at William and Kate's countryside home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk.
The prince is known to be a fan of helicopters, and all things police-related.
Football-mad George is also a passionate Aston Villa fan, just like his father.
George is seen as shyer than his younger sister, Princess Charlotte, occasionally appearing a little reluctant in front of the cameras.
Third-in-line George and his siblings call the Queen ""Gan Gan"".
4. Mia Tindall
Mia is the eldest child of former England rugby star Mike Tindall and Olympic medal-winning horsewoman Zara, daughter of the Princess Royal.
The fun-loving youngster, who was born in 2014, has a reputation for being mischievous.
She is often spotted running around with her father and cousins, Isla and Savannah Phillips, at horse eventing competitions.
During a portrait shoot for the Queen's 90th birthday, Mia, then two, had the privilege of holding her great-grandmother's classic black handbag.
Like Savannah and Isla, she is not an HRH, nor does she have a title.
5. Princess Charlotte
The Cambridges' five-year-old middle child, Charlotte, is known for her confident, feisty character.
The princess, who was born in 2015, likes spicy food and is nicknamed ""Lottie"".
She shares a love of horses with the Queen, and bears a resemblance to her great-grandmother when she was a child.
At the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding in 2018, the playful fourth in line to the throne stuck out her tongue as she arrived by car.
She repeated the gesture while watching a presentation ceremony at the King's Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in 2019.
At the christening of younger brother Prince Louis, she was heard telling off photographers and declaring they were not allowed inside.
6. Prince Louis
William and Kate's youngest child was born in 2018. The toddler proudly joined his siblings, George and Charlotte, when they clapped for carers during lockdown.
In pictures released for his second birthday, he was shown with a paint-covered face and hands as he made a rainbow print for his window.
Louis, who has inherited the Middleton eyes, has been compared to his maternal grandfather, Michael Middleton.
7. Lena Tindall
The Tindalls welcomed a second daughter, Lena, in 2018, after suffering two miscarriages. 
The Queen and Philip's other three great-grandchildren were not in the photograph taken by Kate, having not yet been born in 2018.
8. Archie Mountbatten-Windsor
Archie, who was born in 2019, lives thousands of miles away in California after his parents, Harry and Meghan, stepped down as senior royals last year and moved to the US.
He appears to have inherited his father's red hair, seen when he was pictured in a stylised image on the family's Christmas card.
In the Oprah interview which rocked the monarchy, Meghan accused a member of the royal family - neither the Queen nor Philip - of raising concerns before Archie was born about how dark his skin tone might be.
The duchess also said Archie was not made a prince because of his race - although he is not actually entitled to be one or to have an HRH style yet because of rules set down by King George V more than 100 years ago.
9. August Brooksbank
August Philip Hawke Brooksbank - born to the Duke of York's daughter Princess Eugenie and tequila brand ambassador Jack Brooksbank - arrived on February 9 this year.
Eugenie described their hearts as being 'full of love for this little human'.
His middle name was in honour of the duke.
10. Lucas Tindall
Zara delivered an 8lb 4oz son Lucas on March 21 - with the baby arriving on the bathroom floor in a surprise home birth.
Buckingham Palace said the Queen and the duke were 'delighted' at the news of their 10th great-grandchild.
Lucas has the middle name Philip in honour of both the duke and Mike Tindall's father.
11.  Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's second child is eighth in line to the throne despite being born a US citizen after the couple moved to LA to quit royal life.
Lilibet, who was born in June weighing 8oz and is a sibling for Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, two, has entered the line of royal succession behind her older brother and is set to nudge senior family members further from the throne.
12. Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi 
Princess Beatrice, 33, the oldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, gave birth to a baby girl weighing 6lbs 2oz at 11.42pm on Saturday 18 September at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, in London. 
Her husband Edo Mapelli Mozzi has announced their baby daughter is called Sienna Elizabeth, in a touching tribute to the Queen. 
Although her mother is a princess, Sienna, who is the Queen's 12th great-grandchild, will not have a royal title. Only grandchildren of the monarch through the male line are automatically entitled to the styling of HRH. This means she will be plain Miss Mapelli Mozzi. The Queen could bestow a title on her great-grandchild if desired, but it is unlikely to be asked for.

160,"NASA and the U.S. government are looking for proposals on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon with the goal of having energy on the moon that's not reliant on the sun by the end of the decade.
NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory formally put out a request for proposals from the public on Friday for a fission surface power system. 
In a collaboration between NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab, the two agencies are specifically looking to establish a source of power that does not rely on the sun or solar power for missions on the moon.
'Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,' Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. 
Should the lunar nuclear reactors be a success in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next stop would be Mars, according to the world's leading space agency.
NASA states that such fission surface power could likely provide long-term power for human lunar colonies, regardless of environmental conditions. 
'I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,' Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement.  
The reactor itself would be built on earth before being sent to the moon.
For those who wish to send a proposal, NASA says submitted plans for the fission surface power system will need to include a uranium-fueled reactor core, a thermal management system to keep the reactor at the proper temperature, a system to convert the nuclear power into usable energy, and a distribution system that provides no less than 40 kilowatts of electric power. 
Said power system proposals will need to supply continuous power for 10 years in the lunar environment.
The reactor must also be capable of turning itself on and off without human oversight, that it can operate from a lunar lander deck, and that it is mobile enough to be transported from the lander to a different lunar site for operation if necessary. 
Successful proposals for the reactor must weigh no more than 13,200 pounds, and be able to fit inside a 12-foot diameter cylinder that's 18 feet long when launched from earth to the moon. 
The deadline for proposal requests for an initial system design must be submitted by February 19, the outlet reports.  
This is not the first collaborative project between NASA and the Idaho National Laboratory, with the lab most recently helping build a radioisotope power system for the space agency's Mar's rover Perseverance, which converts heat that's generated from the decay or plutonium-238 into electrical power.
The rover landed on the Martian surface back in February and has remained active on the red planet ever since.  
The Energy Department has also recently been looking for private businesses to collaborate with on various nuclear power plans, most notably a new generation of smaller power plants ranging from small modular rectors to small mobile reactors that can quickly be set up in the field and be removed when no longer needed. ",-2
161,"The White House's communications chief of staff has announced she is leaving her post, marking the administration's second high-profile resignation this week as President Biden's approval ratings continue to plummet. 
White House communications chief of staff Emma Riley said Friday she is resigning from her Oval Office gig less than a year into the administration and is heading to a new post at the Labor Department. 
'It was an honor and privilege to serve @POTUS and the American people at the @White House … I'm excited to be moving down Pennsylvania Ave and traveling around the country with @SecMartyWalsh and @USDOL,' Riley tweeted.
Riley's announcement comes one day after Kamala Harris' communications director Ashley Etienne announced she is leaving the vice president's office, after reports that staff are in-fighting and her boss is being sidelined. 
Etienne, a former staffer to Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, joined Harris' team shortly after the election and said at the time she would only stay a year. 
Etienne is set to leave in December to pursue other opportunities, the White House said.
'Ashley is valued member of the Vice President’s team, who has worked tirelessly to advance the goals of this administration. She is leaving the office in December to pursue other opportunities,' a White House official told DailyMail.com.
Etienne's departure comes as her soon-to-be former boss has taken a beating in recent weeks with a series of unflattering stories about her role as vice president, in-fighting among her staff, and complaints from her allies the Biden administration is not properly utilizing her.
Harris has denied those claims, saying she doesn't feel like she's being underutilized by President Joe Biden and his team.
'No. I don't,' she said when asked this week if she feels she's being underutilized.
'I am very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished but I am also absolutely, absolutely clear-eyed that there is a lot more to do and we're going to get it done,' Harris told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired on Good Morning America Thursday morning.
Harris' boss has not fared much better, however, as Biden's approval rating dropped to 36 percent in a new poll released this week that said most voters want to see Republicans take control of Congress.
The new numbers - from a Quinnipiac University poll - indicate a level of frustration among voters with the party in power as the country prepares for next year's midterm elections.
Only 36 percent of those polled approve of the job President Biden is doing while 53 percent disapprove. It's the lowest job approval rating he's received in a Quinnipiac University poll. 
In the survey, 46 percent said they want to see Republicans win control of the House - compared to 38 percent who want Democrats - and 46 percent want the GOP in the charge of the Senate, compared to 40 percent who favor Democrats.
Independent voters, who typically decide matters in elections, also want to see Republicans in charge of Congress: 41 percent to 31 percent for the House, respectively, and 44 percent to 34 percent for the Senate.
Additionally, a slight majority of Americans - 52 percent - said the Democratic Party has moved to the left.
Historically, the president's political party tends to do badly in the first midterms after they take office. Both Barack Obama and Donald Trump saw their respective parties lose control of the House of Representatives in their first midterms - 2010 and 2018, respectively.",-2
162,"A large fire broke out in a building on an iconic street in Central Paris this morning near the Place de L'Opera square.  
The building on 17 Boulevard des Capucines erupted into flames and sent clouds of smoke rising into the air. 
It started in an office at 10.30am, on the third floor of the seven-floor building.
The building is situated between the 2nd and 9th arrondissement of Paris and above a Bennetton store, Rossignol and a Five Guys.
The iconic opera house Palais Garnier is some 984 feet away from the building and  100 firefighters desperately worked to stop the inferno spreading. 
Crews brought the fire under control at midday and there were no reported deaths or injuries following the blaze.    
Place de L'Opera was closed along with the nearby metro station.
The cause of the fire has not yet been established.  
Firefighters were also seen dealing with the inferno on the second floor of the building.  
The fire hit the 3rd floor of the building and a little of the 4th floor and there is housing on the last two floors of the block.
Earlier, a drone was also deployed to survey the extent of the damage to the building from the air. 
According to Le Figaro , an investigation will happen to determine the cause of the fire.
Social media users took to Twitter to share videos of the ferocious blaze as it first took hold.
Pictures and videos were also circulated as firefighters began to bring the blaze under control and worked to stop it spreading.
Some shared their sadness over the fire, with one person tweeting: 'Triste triste' (sad, sad).
Others shared videos of the beginning of the fire, saying it was a 'strange morning.' 
Boulevard des Capucines is one of the 'Grands Boulevards' in Paris. 
The name comes from the convent of Capuchin nuns and the road houses some of the most iconic buildings in Paris. 
The fire comes two days after Thursday's fire at Palais Vivienne in Paris which started in the kitchens of an Asian restaurant on the ground floor.
No injuries were reported and the fire was dealt with.
The owner, Pierre--Jean Chalençon was evacuated safely from the building.",-2
163,"Adele's ex husband Simon Konecki has reportedly resigned himself to the singer detailing their divorce in her new heartbreak album 30.
The charity CEO knew the risks going into his relationship with the songstress, 33, and that she 'wears her heart on her sleeve' in her songs, a new report claims.   
The former couple announced they were going their separate ways in April 2019, with Adele filing court documents five months later. They share one son - Angelo - who is nine. 
A source told The Mirror: 'Simon likes to be under the radar. He doesn't attend big glamorous Hollywood events. He certainly doesn't discuss his marriage at all with people.
'He has had to resign himself to the fact that she would talk. He knew the risks going in. This is the type of artist she is, she wears her heart on her sleeve.' 
'They have a very modern-day family dynamic.
'They've been adamant any personal tension should never come ahead of what's best for Angelo.'
Representatives for Adele and Simon have been contacted by MailOnline for a comment.  
It comes after earlier this week Adele revealed that she walked away from a secret relationship a year after she split from her ex-husband Simon because she associated him with the breakdown of her marriage.  
Speaking to The Face, the singer - who is now dating Rich Paul - said:  'It wasn't right, leaving a marriage and then dating a year after. Even if you feel ready, it's a gaping, open wound whether you leave or you're left.'  
She continued: 'I was unable to pretend that I wasn't in my own storm... I couldn't give myself properly. I couldn't be consistent, and neither could he.   
'I associate him with the breakdown of my marriage. So therefore, he is part of the storm. 
'And I was just, you know, really honest with him about it, thank God. Otherwise I could've found myself in a situation being in a relationship I didn't want to be in after coming out of one.' 
Adele is now happily dating the sports agent Rich Paul, 39, after they met at a mutual friends birthday party, became friends, and later started a relationship.  
The singer's latest candid interview came after it was revealed that her upcoming album would include heartbreaking voice notes exchanged with her son Angelo.
In an emotional track, My Little Love, the singer includes audio recordings from conversations with her nine-year-old in which he attempts to stop her crying amid her 2019 divorce, which is the key subject of the record. 
Adele - who shares Angelo with ex-husband Simon - sings: 'I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad'. 
In more heart wrenching notes she says 'Tell me you love me', to which Angelo replies, 'I love you, one million per cent. I feel like you like me too.' 
Adele continues in the tearful voice notes: 'You know Mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right? Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings lately, I'm confused and I don't know what I'm doing.' 
In more voice notes to her son she says: 'I love your dad because he gave you to me...  I've had a bad day, I'm very anxious...
'I feel very paranoid, stressed, and I'm hungover which never helps. I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I actually feel lonely — and I never do. 
'I just feel really lonely and frightened, and I'm worried I might feel like this a lot.' 
In Woman Like Me meanwhile, she sung of Simon: 'Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy? It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy...
'All you do is complain about decisions you make / How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate?' 
While Adele features her son on her new album, and dedicated the music to him, she revealed this week that her One Night Only CBS special concert was the first time Angelo had ever seen her perform. ",-2
164,"Bill Maher has dared House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to appear on his HBO talk show.
The Real Time host also scolded the far-left ‘Squad’ member on Friday for dismissing critics of ‘wokeness’ - which he claims is the reason Democrats suffered electoral defeats this year in Virginia and elsewhere.
Maher said he would 'love' to have Ocasio-Cortez on his show since there's 'so much to admire' about her, particularly her efforts to combat climate change.
'But that will probably never happen because Democrats don't go anywhere these days where they're not being adored,' Maher said.
'And that's my last bit of advice to them. Go where the ""amen corner"" isn't.
'Do Fox News. Be brave. Come here. Go everywhere.'
Maher added: 'Winning is about expanding the electorate.'
DailyMail.com has reached out to a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez seeking reaction to Maher's comments. 
The HBO talker also hit out at Ocasio-Cortez and the Democratic Party for turning ‘woke’ into a ‘pejorative’ that has turned off voters.
'If the word only made you think of rational, deserved causes like teaching a less whitewashed version of American history, AOC would still want to own it,' Maher said.
'But it's a joke because it makes you think of people who wake up offended and take orders from Twitter.
'And their oversensitivity has grown tiresome.'
In his monologue on Friday’s show, Maher mentioned that Ocasio-Cortez rejected criticism from political strategist James Carville that Democrats’ touting of ‘stupid wokeness’ hurt them at the polling stations.
The congresswoman from Queens and the Bronx tweeted earlier this month that the term ‘woke’ was primarily used by ‘older people.’
'Like the average audience for people seriously using the word ​""​woke""​ in a 2021 political discussion are James Carville and Fox News pundits so that should tell you all you need to know​,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted earlier this month.
She hit out at Carville, a former top adviser to Bill Clinton, tweeting: ‘​And before people disingenuously complain “woke” is denigrating to older people, it’s actually pundits like Carville using terms like “woke” to insult voters under 45 that’s denigrating.’
She added: '​Don’t wonder why youth turnout falls when Dems talk about them like this. We need everyone​.'
Ocasio-Cortez was reacting to an interview that Carville gave to PBS News House to discuss Republican Glen Youngkin's victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia gubernatorial race.
Republicans also captured the state legislature in Virginia, which had previously been led by a Democrat majority.
The election in Virginia and other races nationwide this year has political observers predicting that the GOP will take back the House and the Senate next year.
'What?!' Maher said, reacting to Ocasio-Cortez's criticism of Carville.
'This is a term folks like you brought out very recently, had been proudly displaying it every march since.
'Just last year, The Guardian declared ""woke"" the ""word of our era.""
'I guess they didn't get the memo from the Mean Girls Club.'
Maher continued: 'What a great strategy, never missing an opportunity to remind voters how lame and clueless and hopelessly cool they are, especially since those are the ones who actually vote.
'But OK, fine. What word would you like us to use for the plainly insane excesses of the left that are not liberalism but something completely different?
'Because you can't have that word ""liberal"" from us and think it should cover things like canceling Lincoln.
'And teaching third-graders they're oppressors. That's all your new-think.'
Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats' so-called 'woke problem' was 'made up' to try and push the left away from fighting for racial injustice and election reform, which she claims could help them win.
'One dangerous aspect of thinking there's a 'woke problem' is that Dem chances for re-election or majorities in House, Senate , & WH rely on the racial justice issue of voting rights,' the New York representative tweeted earlier this month.
She added: 'Dems distancing from racial justice makes protection of voting rights less likely, ensuring losses.'
Republicans and establishment Democrats claimed that the party's embracing a more progressive agenda and going 'woke' contributed to the wave of defeats in this month's election.
She said that the term 'woke' is a way for the GOP to launch attacks and deflect from civil rights advancements – such as the teaching of Critical Race Theory in schools that became a central issue to the Virginia gubernatorial election.
'Woke' is a term pundits are now using as a derogatory euphemism for civil rights & justice,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
'Making up a 'woke' problem results in putting civil & voting rights on the backburner,' she continued.
'In a year state legislatures are planning out GOP majorities & voter suppression, that's dangerous.'
'People think Fox News is just about indoctrinating right-wingers, but it's also about conditioning Dems on what to run away from,' the three-part Twitter thread read.
Carville, who helped steer Bill Clinton to victory in 1992 aimed squarely at cultural clashes over race, education, and police funding as the heart of the matter, after Youngkin took down McAuliffe by winning over suburban areas that had gone for Joe Biden just a year ago.
'What went wrong is just stupid wokeness. Don't just look at Virginia and New Jersey. Look at Long Island, look at Buffalo, look at Minneapolis, even look at Seattle, Washington,' Carville said as he ticked off election results in an appearance on PBS News Hour.
'I mean, this 'defund the police' lunacy, this take Abraham Lincoln's name off of schools. I mean that — people see that,' he said.
He said Terry McAuliffe got 'caught up in something national' and blamed it for his loss (McAuliffe also has deep Clinton ties). 
Earlier this week, Maher appeared on Chris Cuomo's CNN prime time talk show and repeated his criticisms of 'wokeness.'
Maher, who describes himself as an 'old-school liberal', slammed the far left and progressive side of the Democrats which he called the 'party of no common sense'.
He added that he supported teaching the history of racism in America, but 'that's different than teaching children that racism is the essence of America.' 
'That's what people get upset about, or involving children who are not old enough or sophisticated enough to understand this very complicated history.' 
Maher also told Cuomo that he supports Dave Chappelle, who received backlash after making derogatory comments about trans people, and said he himself has received calls to be cancelled from conservatives and liberals alike. 
The late night host warned that Donald Trump would run for re-election in 2022 and further a 'slow-moving coup' take over the GOP with his supporters. 
As they discussed cancel culture and Maher's apparent diversion from liberals, Cuomo asked The Real Time talk show host if he was worried about getting cancelled. 
Maher shrugged the question off because he said 'both sides' have tried cancelling him. 
'My politics have not changed. I'm an old-school liberal. We were talking about the race issue. They changed, not me,' Maher said. 
'I was the old — we should be moving toward a color-blind society where we don't see race. That's the old way to look at it, I think that's still the good way to look at it.' 
Along with decades of criticism from conservatives, Maher has recently received backlash from fellow liberals over his opinions on topics like CRT and cancel culture.        ",-2
165,"One of Ghislaine Maxwell's accusers had a hand in setting up Tom Parker Bowles in a newspaper cocaine sting in the 90s, it has been reported.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is expected to appear as a witness for the prosecution at Maxwell's trial which is due to start on November 29 and is set to be the trial of the century.
But, according to the Telegraph, it has now come to light that the woman was paid up to £40,000 to help a tabloid newspaper set up Mr Parker Bowles, son of the Duchess of Cornwall, as part of a well-publicized sting in 1999.
The newspaper reports that the incident may be brought up during Maxwell's trial as part of the defence's bid to undermine the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
In the sting, which took place in 1999, Mr Parker Bowles was secretly filmed offering to buy cocaine for the woman, who was used by the tabloid because she knew Mr Parker Bowles at the time. 
He also admitted using cocaine himself with 'someone he found last night' while working in France. 
Mr Parker Bowles, who was 24 at the time and working as a publicist, was caught in the sting while at the Cannes Film Festival and the incident was splashed over five pages of the News of the World. 
In contemporary reports, Parker Bowles was described as 'contrite' while it was said Prince Charles, who was then a patron of the drugs charity Phoenix House, was 'fairly cross' with the 24-year-old and scolded him for having been caught up in the sting. 
The Telegraph also adds that another witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has previously been arrested for possession of cocaine and use of drug paraphernalia.
Ghislaine, a British socialite and daughter of the late Robert Maxwell who is currently in a New York jail, is due to stand trial in the United States in just over a week.
Maxwell, 59, is charged with sex trafficking, with prosecutors claiming she helped pedophile Jeffrey Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately sexually abuse young girls.
She has pleaded not guilty, and the trial is expected to begin on November 29. 
Earlier this month, Maxwell spoke to The Mail on Sunday for the first time about her 'living hell' behind bars – claiming that she has been assaulted and abused by prison guards, purposely deprived of sleep and given rotting food to eat.
Maxwell, who had her $28million (£21M) bail application denied for the fourth time last week, also claimed negative media coverage while she has been in custody and the deliberate withholding of evidence have made it 'impossible' for her to receive a fair trial. ",-2
166,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday appeared to contradict her boss, President Joe Biden, in expressing disappointment over the acquittal of accused Kenosha vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse.
‘Today’s verdict speaks for itself,’ the vice president told reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force Two in Columbus, Ohio, on Friday.
The former California senator and San Francisco district attorney added: ‘I've spent a majority of my career working to make our criminal justice system more equitable.
‘It’s clear, there’s still a lot more work to do.’
Harris’ comments don’t jive with those made by Biden, who told reporters on Friday: ‘I stand by what the jury has concluded. The jury system works and we have to abide by it.’
Those comments by Biden generated a backlash from liberals on Twitter. Later on Friday, Biden issued a written statement saying he was ‘angry’ and 'concerned' over the verdict.
‘While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken,’ the president said in his written statement.
‘I know that we're not going to heal our country's wounds overnight, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under the law,’ he continued.
‘I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law.
‘Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy.’
Public opinion on the verdict was split largely along partisan lines. While Democrats panned the acquittal, Republicans praised it. 
Biden said the White House and federal authorities have been in contact with Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers and offered support as Kenosha and the nation brace for fallout from the verdict. 
In New York City on Friday night, several protesters angry at the verdict assembled outside the Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn. 
This comes as Republicans renewed demands that Biden apologize for calling the Kenosha shooter a white supremacist before the trial. 
Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, said he was dismayed by Biden's depiction of Rittenhouse as a white supremacist.
'I've never had a case, I don't think I ever will, where within two days or three days of one another, you know, the President and the presidential candidate comment on it. And both of them had such different beliefs,' Richards said.
'President Biden said some things, I think are so incorrect and untrue — he is not a white supremacist. I'm glad that he at least respects the jury verdict.'
Tom Cotton, the Republican senator for Arkansas, tweeted: 'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse.'
Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican party, said: 'Before he knew the facts, Biden prejudged the Rittenhouse case. He smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case. What Biden did was dangerous and inflammatory. 
'Biden needs to apologize and ACT NOW before the left uses his lies to fuel violence.' 
Cori Bush, a congresswoman for Missouri and member of 'The Squad' described Rittenhouse's acquittal as 'white supremacy in action'.
'This system isn’t built to hold white supremacists accountable,' she said. 
'It’s why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free. 
'I’m hurt. I’m angry. I’m heartbroken.'
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agreed, tweeting: 'What we are witnessing is a system functioning as designed and protecting those it was designed for.'
Fellow Squad member Ayanna Pressley added: 'Racism & white supremacy remain the bedrock of our legal system. My heart breaks for the family & loved ones of those whose lives were stolen, and the trauma our communities face today and every day. 
'The struggle for accountability, for justice, for healing goes on.' 
The head of the House Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they’re not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people.' 
Donald Trump's PAC, Save America, sent an email soliciting funds for his campaign coffers and stating: 'GREAT NEWS FOR KYLE RITTENHOUSE, who we knew was innocent all along.
'This trial was nothing more than a WITCH HUNT from the Radical Left. They want to PUNISH law-abiding citizens, including a CHILD, like Kyle Rittenhouse, for doing nothing more than following the LAW.'
Dan Bishop, a congressman representing North Carolina, said: 'Don’t forget, Biden labeled a 17-year old Rittenhouse a “white supremacist.” Beyond shameful.'
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman representing Georgia, said that Rittenhouse was 'one of the good guys'.
She attacked Biden for saying he was concerned at the verdict, warned that he was inciting violence, and angrily singled out fellow members of Congress who had condemned Rittenhouse's actions.
'Kyle Rittenhouse ACQUITTED on ALL charges! May Kyle and his family now live in peace. Those who help, protect, and defend are the good guys. Kyle is one of good ones. 
'@JoeBiden is angry & concerned that the jury found Kyle Rittenhouse NOT GUILTY after being shown mountains of evidence proving his innocence. 
'Biden calling for “peaceful protest” now against the verdict. We all know what it means when the left calls for“peaceful” protest..
And Lauren Boebert, the Colorado congresswoman who has made defense of the Second Amendment a pillar of her policies, tweeted: 'Today is a great day for the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense. Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty on all counts! Glory to God!'
Progressives, however, expressed dismay at the verdict.
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they’re not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people. To call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
Rittenhouse did not take a gun across state lines before the shooting: he picked it up from a house in Kenosha.
Cori Bush, a congresswoman representing Missouri who is considered part of 'The Squad' of recently-elected progressives, said the verdict was 'white supremacy in action'.
'The judge. The jury. The defendant. It's white supremacy in action,' she tweeted. 
'This system isn’t built to hold white supremacists accountable. It’s why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free.  
The jury — a couple of them wearing masks — showed no emotion as the verdicts were read after four torturous days of deliberation and weeks of testimony.
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.

COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
DISMISSED - COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it
Rittenhouse's mother Wendy was in the public gallery and burst into tears as the verdicts were read, while Rittenhouse victim Joseph Rosenbaum's fiancée and victim Anthony Huber's girlfriend and great aunt tearfully listened as their loved ones' killer walked free. 
'I’m hurt. I’m angry. I'm heartbroken.' 
Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Progressive Caucus, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
The district attorney for San Francisco, Chesa Boudin - considered one of the most liberal DAs in the country - also criticized the verdict.
'This verdict demonstrates that our work to make our legal system equal, fair, and just is more urgent than ever. Prosecutors have a critical role to play in criminal justice reform and securing equal justice under the law. 
'We will continue our fight for justice.' 
As the first verdict was read Friday afternoon, Rittenhouse, 18, started to shake as he fought back tears. But by the end he could hold them no longer and he collapsed into his chair, then hugged defense attorney Corey Chirafisi. 
Immediately after the verdict was read, Rittenhouse, dressed in a navy blue suit and purple shirt and tie, was whisked out of the courtroom and into a waiting SUV. He was seen smiling as he was driven away. 
Two men in the public gallery gave each other a high-five but apart from that the 'audience' — as Judge Bruce Schroeder called them — remained quiet and filed out of the room.
Clearly disappointed, prosecutor Thomas Binger, who has been heavily criticized for his actions during the case, sat back in his chair, looked at the ceiling, and issued a sigh as the verdict came in. 
Defense attorney Mark Richards slapped the table  after the fifth not guilty verdict was read. 
All that was left was for Schroeder to complement the jurors for being attentive and co-operative. 'I couldn't have wished for a better jury,' he said before reminding them playfully that they are eligible to be selected again in four years' time.
He also told them that they had the right to discuss the case with the media if they wanted, but told them they also had the right not to. Their names have not been released and he said any media requests to talk to them would be handled by the court and passed on to the jurors. 
Now Kenosha is on edge to see whether it descends into violence again. 
Protestors from both sides milled on the courtroom steps — one white man saying how proud he was of Rittenhouse and the verdict, standing feet from a black woman railing about white justice.
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that has threatened to derail proceedings more than once.
Outside the court, defense lawyer Mark Richards said Rittenhouse was feeling a 'huge sense of relief' at the verdict.
'He is on his way home, he wants to get on with his life,' Richards said.
Richards revealed that the defense team had two mock trials, one with Rittenhouse giving testimony and one without and it was clear from the jury reaction that he had to go on the stand.
He also said the jury deliberations were longer than any other case he had been involved in. 
Richards said he believed the Rittenhouse family would move out of the area because of the number of death threats they have received.
'Kyle is in counseling for PTSD. He doesn't sleep at night,' he said.
'Eventually some anonymity will come back to him but I don't think he will continue to live in this area.'
He said Rittenhouse plans to be a nurse.
Richards also criticized prosecutor Thomas Binger. 'Justice is done when the truth is reached. Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth. It's not about winning,' he said.
But he praised Judge Schroeder, saying he had presided over a 'fair trial.'
'He gives you a fair trial as a defendant — but you don't want him to sentence your client,' he said, commenting on his reputation for handing out stiff sentences.
'If we had lost we know what would happen, he would have gotten life in prison. We asked for a fair trial and we got one.'
He defended Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the from a tumbler the jurors who would become alternates, saying the defense team was 'devastated' that three of the jurors they considered most on their side were barred from the final deliberations. 
Binger had made it clear earlier in the week that he would not comment whatever the outcome of the case.
But his boss Kenosha County District Attorney Mike Graveley issued a statement saying: 'We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations.
'Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.'
Graveley added a plea for calm. 'We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.'
The family of Rittenhouse victim Anthony Huber said in a statement, 'Today's verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son. It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people.'
About an hour after the verdict was announced a woman collapsed from what was believed to be an epileptic seizure outside the courthouse.
Police cleared demonstrators as an ambulance rushed to the scene.
The day started quietly as Judge Schroeder went through a docket of other cases. He arrived at the court shortly after 9am, stopping outside to chat with a group of photographers — jokingly asking why there were so many people around neoclassical courthouse which dates back to 1850.
Unlike nearly every other judge anywhere in the country, Schroder makes a point of walking to his chambers through the public gallery in the eggshell-blue-painted court, decorated with oil paintings of local legal luminaries.
Walking with a slight limp, he greeted reporters, court staff and lawyers as he passed through.
The first three hours of the day's proceedings were quiet with a growing feeling in the court that the jurors were hopelessly deadlocked and no verdict would be coming before the weekend. Schroeder stayed in his chambers for most of the time.
But around noon, the judge ordered that the outer door to his chambers should be closed — for the first time in the trial. From then it was clear that the case was about to come to a close.
A few minutes later prosecution and defense attorneys came into the room along with Rittenhouse, who had been spending time outside the courtroom in a private room on the third floor.
Schroeder announced that the jurors had finally reached their verdict and made his warning to the public gallery not to react. 'As you can see there are several members of law enforcement present and you will be whisked out of here if there is any reaction,' he warned.
Then the jury of seven women and five men filed in, taking their seats to the judge's left.
Schroeder told Rittenhouse to face the jury and 'hearken' to what they had to say.
 Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other counts for killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz on August 25, 2020. 
Demonstrators have been gathered outside the Kenosha Courthouse all week, as Evers called in 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard to counter the expected protests.  ",-2
167,"Police in Portland were forced to declare a riot after protestors turned violent, clashing with officers and smashing windows, as looting and protests erupted overnight in major cities following Kyle Rittenhouse's not-guilty verdict. 
Masses of people gathered coast-to-coast Friday night to decry Rittenhouse's acquittal in protests that reflected the divisiveness and anger stoked by the high-profile case. 
Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on August 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Hours after the verdict, police in Portland were forced to declare a riot after about 200 protestors turned destructive, damaging the front gate of the Multnomah County Justice Center and clashing with officers.   
'Due to violent, destructive behavior by a significant part of the crowd, the gathering in downtown Portland is a RIOT. All participants are instructed to proceed away to the WEST,' the Portland Police Bureau wrote on Twitter.
According to police, rioters threw objects at officers, smashed the rear window of a police car as well as windows from the city print shop and spray-painted the justice center building with graffiti that read 'all cops are Kyles, no justice, no peace', FOX 12 reported.  
Protestors were warned they would be arrested and were subject to force if they remained in the area. 
In total, one person was arrested for a warrant and five citations and 17 warnings were issued, FOX 12reported.   
The high profile case has riled the nation and led to Republican senator Tom Cotton to call on President Joe Biden to publicly apologize to Rittenhouse for suggesting the teen was a white supremacist during his presidential campaign. 
Biden tweeted a video where he featured an image of Rittenhouse alongside footage of white supremacist groups. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' Cotton tweeted.
In Chicago looters broke into a Neiman Marcus and a Game Stop on the Southside as protest went on in the downtown area.  
FOX 32 reported that 15 males stormed into a Mag Mile Neiman Marcus store, stealing merchandise and escaping in three separate vehicles. 
Overhead footage shows a South Side GameStop store with broken glass and merchandise on the ground, but police did not confirm if it was a looting, FOX 32 reported.
In New York City, hundreds gathered outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to express their fury in the verdict as similar events unfolded across the nation.
Scores of people were seen marching through New York about 7 p.m. carrying signs that branded Rittenhouse as a 'racist killer' and the judicial system as biased.
'The message is that when you stand up for black liberation, when you stand up for black lives, no matter who you are you automatically become a target of the system,' Na-Lakan Masego, a protester, told CBS New York. 
Another speaker at the rally said the jury's verdict was a blow to the entire nation.
'By allowing Kyle Rittenhouse to walk away, this entire country – this government – has slapped us all in the face for the millionth time,' he told the crowd. 'We cannot allow them to continue treating us like we do not exist because they hurt us.' 
 
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. 
Kenosha itself remained largely quiet as the night wore on.
A crowd of around 40 people gathered at the courthouse but remained peaceful. Many carried signs, including one saying 'Welcome to AmeriKKKa.'
A middle-aged man, wearing a Stars and Stripes hat tried to provoke the crowd with a sign saying 'Rittenhouse Rules!' 
One young woman was arrested after she scrawled the words 'White supremacists are cowards' and 'Judge Schroeder must go' on the courthouse steps. She was referring to the trial's judge, Bruce Schroeder.
Police, who had largely stayed out of sight as the crowd grew, swooped in quickly and hauled her away. 
President Joe Biden has urged peace, saying the country must abide by the jury's verdict. 
New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said the issue revolves around the definition of self-defense, which Rittenhouse claimed to be acting in when he shot the three men.
'It also depends who has a gun, and it also depends on what they're actually fighting for,' he told CBS New York. 'It seems if you are trying to say something about Black Lives Matter or something about justice and equity, it doesn't have the same weight.'
Others chanted 'no justice, no peace,' and 'these racist cops have got to go' as they marched.
One event speaker called on attendees to continue participating in such events as long as it remains necessary, despite the approaching winter.
'Black lives are still mattering and they're still going to be shot down,' she said. 'And when we call on you to show up, I need you to f***ing show up.' 
In Los Angeles, the Coalition for Community Control Over the Police called on its supporters to step up in protest.
'Kyle walked,' the group said on its Facebook page.
It invited protesters to meet Friday afternoon at Florence and Normandie, where outraged masses gathered in 1992 after a jury acquitted four police officers in the brutal beating of Rodney King, sparking the LA riots.
'Bring water and mutual aid items if u want to continue that work.'
Dozens of people gathered at Chicago's Federal Plaza carrying signs that said 'reject racist vigilante terror' and chanting 'lock him up,' the Chicago Tribune reported.
'He is part of a whole fascist movement that is gaining ground around the country and it will not stop until we recognize it and take matters into our own hands nonviolently refusing to accept a racist America,' event speaker Jay Becker told attendees during the peaceful event.
Some shouted: 'The whole damn system is guilty as hell. Indict, convict, send Rittenhouse to jail.'
In Northern California, businesses were boarding their windows and police were erecting barricades to prepare for planned protests, ABC News 7 reported.
About 100 people participated in an Oakland protest.
Portland Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell said during a Friday press conference that it was 'reasonable' to expect protests in that city as well.
'Here in Portland especially, it's reasonable to expect there will be some type of reaction to the verdict,' Lovell told reporters. 'Like we've said many, many times, we're supportive of peaceful protest, people exercising their First Amendment rights.'
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers also called for calm in a statement released Friday afternoon.
'I echo the calls of local Kenosha community leaders and join them in asking everyone who might choose to assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights in any community to please only do so safely and peacefully,' the governor said.
'We must have peace in Kenosha and our communities, and any efforts or actions aimed at sowing division are unwelcome in our state as they will only hinder that healing.'",-2
168,"Disappointed, prosecutor Thomas Binger, who has been heavily criticized for his actions during the case, sat back in his chair, looked at the ceiling, and issued a sigh as the first verdict in the Kenosha murder trial came in.
Defense lawyer Mark Richards did not hold back, blasting the Kyle Rittenhouse prosecutor within minutes of the end of the trial in Wisconsin.
‘Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth — it’s not about winning,’ he said.
‘This case became about winning and that’s probably why it got so personal.’
Richards was speaking after Rittenhouse, 18, was sensationally cleared of all charges resulting from the night he took his AR-15 rifle from his home in Antioch, Illinois to the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where demonstrators were protesting the shooting of black man Joseph Blake.
He shot Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber dead and injured a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz. But the jury of seven women and five men on Friday found him not guilty of all charges.
‘I’ve known Tom Binger for a long time,’ Richards said. ‘I knew him when he was a civil lawyer. I’m disappointed with some of the things he did.’
Richards was just the latest to criticize Binger’s performance in the two-week trial, in which he frequently butted heads with Judge Bruce Schroeder.
But Binger wasn't alone in the legal line of fire.
Many court watchers believe Binger was thrown into the case because District Attorney Graveley — who would normally prosecute such a high-profile case himself — knew the case against Rittenhouse was weak.
'Binger was set up for failure,' one Kenosha legal insider told DailyMail.com during the trial. 'Graveley is the superstar and he knew this one was sure to tarnish it.'
The conservative Milwaukee Right Now said Graveley 'pawned the case off to his unfortunate assistant district attorney, Thomas Binger, who was left to spin gold out of a pile of self-defense straw.’
Problems started before the trial with the charges that the District Attorney’s office had brought against Rittenhouse.
Then-presidential candidate Joe Biden had called Rittenhouse a white supremacist in a tweet, asking why Donald Trump didn’t disavow such people.
That put huge pressure on Kenosha County District Attorney Graveley to come down hard on Rittenhouse, who was then 17.
He was charged as an adult with first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree attempted intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.
Despite being charged as an adult, he also was charged with possessing a weapon while under the age of 18.
Many court watchers felt the prosecution would have had more success if they had brought lesser charges against him.
Daniel Adams, a former Milwaukee County assistant district attorney who isn’t involved in the trial, described Binger’s case as ‘incredibly underwhelming.’
‘He’s got nothing,’ Adams said. ‘I just don’t understand it. What are we doing here? We’re all kind of scratching our heads.’
Problems grew right from Binger’s opening statement when he claimed that Rittenhouse had ‘chased Joseph Rosenbaum down’ and shot him.
But video footage showed that Rosenbaum — a convicted child molester who had been released from a mental health facility earlier in the day — had chased Rittenhouse and ambushed him.
He threw a plastic bag at the teen, cornering’ him between parked cars before Rittenhouse turned and shot as Rosenbaum, who was carrying a chain, lunged for the muzzle of his gun.
Binger was also embarrassed when he was questioning journalist Richard McGinnis who witnessed Rittenhouse shoot Rosenbaum.
‘You have no idea what Mr. Rosenbaum was thinking at any point of his life. You have never been inside his head. You never met him before,’ he said to McGinnis, adding ‘it’s complete guesswork, isn’t it?’
McGinnis shrugged and replied: ‘Well, he said, “F**k you” and reached for [Rittenhouse’s] weapon.’
There were also problems with the testimony of brothers Sahil and Anmol Khindri, who owned the car dealership that Rittenhouse said he was called to protect.
Sahil said he had not asked Rittenhouse to guard the lot while Anmol said he had not met him. But a photo appeared of the two brothers with Rittenhouse and others taken before the riots began.
‘When they put on the Khindri brothers knowing that they were lying, that is a problem,’ said Richards.
Binger was also widely ridiculed for pointing Rittenhouse’s weapon during the trial and for his many clashes with Judge Schroeder.
The most notable was when he tried to introduce testimony about Rittenhouse’s silence in the months between the shootings and the trial that the judge had explicitly ruled inadmissible in a pre-trial hearing.
‘Why would you think that that made it okay for you without any advance notice to bring this matter before the jury?” Schroeder shouted at Binger.
‘I was astonished when you began your examination by commenting on the defendant’s post-arrest silence. That’s basic law. It’s been basic law in this country for 40 years, 50 years. I have no idea why you would do something like that.’
Schroeder also berated him for talking about Rosenbaum setting a fire.
'All we're talking about is arson. We're talking about being loud and disorderly,' Binger said.
Schroeder immediately cut him off. 'I can't believe some of what you're saying,' he said in a raised voice. 'All we're talking about is arson? Come on!'
Binger, 51, made it clear earlier this week that whatever the outcome of the case he would make no public comment.
Instead it was left to Graveley to issue a statement saying: ‘We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations. Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.
‘We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
After six years prosecuting, he went into private practice as director of litigation for a business law firm before joining the Kenosha County DA's office.
He ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the post of District Attorney in neighboring Racine County in 2016, saying: 'In the last two years as a prosecutor, I have won 13 jury trials. I have convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, drunk drivers, home-invading burglars and men who abuse women.'
One of the most notable cases he has previously prosecuted was of a former New Jersey fire captain who was jailed for five years in 2017 for possessing child pornography and exploiting a child for sexual purposes.
Binger insisted the sentence was not enough, telling Essex News Daily, 'The state recommended 16 years.'
He was also forced to withdraw a case against Guy Smith, a trucker who was found with a gun in his cab. Smith's defense attorney pointed out the law specifically allowed handguns in vehicles without a concealed carry permit, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
The Smith case was also heard by Judge Schroeder.
But those cases had nothing like the media spotlight that has shone on the Rittenhouse case.
Binger's role has been controversial since the start. He took the unusual step of objecting to the attempt by California attorney John Pierce to represent Rittenhouse, saying in a six-page motion to the court that Pierce's presence could 'materially prejudice' the case.
He said Pierce's 'personal financial difficulties raise significant ethical concerns,' adding: 'Given his own substantial personal debts, his involvement with an unregulated and opaque 'slush fund' provides ample opportunity for self-dealing and fraud
'Money that should be held in trust for the defendant may instead be used to repay Attorney Pierce's numerous creditors.'
Pierce, who claimed the case against Rittenhouse was a 'political prosecution' eventually withdrew, leaving the defense in the hands of lawyer Mark Richards.
Binger clashed with Schroeder in pre-trial hearings. Last month the judge ruled against him saying that the men shot by Rittenhouse could not be called 'victims' during the trial but allowed a defense motion which allows them to be called rioters, looters or arsonists.
Thomas Binger is a seven-year veteran at the law office run by Kenosha County's top prosecutor, Michael Graveley. 
Graveley did not personally handling the high-profile Rittenhouse case because he was tasked with the investigation into the police shooting of Jacob Blake at the time Rittenhouse was charged. It was Blake's shooting on August 23 that sparked the Kenosha riots. 
Binger and Judge Bruce Schroeder, who sits on Kenosha County Circuit Court, clashed frequently in the run-up to the trial, and the proceedings were as explosive as expected. 
Schroeder, who at 75 is the longest-serving active circuit judge in Wisconsin, has the reputation of being a stern judge who often hands down tough sentences. 
The website Wisconsin Right Now described his approach as 'bizarre', saying that he frequently made moves that seemed to help the defense in their argument that the teenager acted in self-defense - such as discussing the chaos engulfing Rittenhouse as he opened fire, showing videos of violent protest, and leading Rittenhouse to say that he wanted to help people. 
Binger graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1996 and became a criminal prosecutor at the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office in 1999, where he eventually rose to the rank of assistant district attorney. 
He went on to work for the DeMark, Kolbe & Brodek law firm as director of litigation in 2005 before joining the Kenosha County District Attorney's Office in 2014. 
In 2016, Binger ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the district attorney's seat in Racine County, telling the Journal Times: 'In the last two years as a prosecutor, I have won 13 jury trials. I have convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, drunk drivers, home-invading burglars and men who abuse women.'
He is married to Nicole Gustafson-Binger, a mental health counselor for Oakwood Clinical Associates. They have three children.  
In the lead up to the Rittenhouse murder trial, Binger lost the chance to link Rittenhouse to the Proud Boys extremist group. 
He was later strongly criticized by Judge Schroeder, in pre-trial hearings, after arguing that defense lawyers should not be able to tell jurors about Joseph Rosenbaum's destructive actions during the riot, including setting a dumpster on fire. 
'All we're talking about is arson. We're talking about being loud and disorderly,' Binger said.
Schroeder cut him off and raised his voice.
'I can't believe some of what you're saying,' he said. 'All we're talking about is arson? Come on!'
Schroeder during the trial reprimanded Binger for bringing up information that had previously been barred from the court about Rittenhouse's history with an AR-15 rifle. An incident was caught on video two weeks prior to the shootings in which Rittenhouse talked about shooting men he believed were shoplifting at a pharmacy.
Schroeder had already ruled video inadmissible. 
'You're an experienced trial attorney and you're telling me when the judge says, 'I'm excluding this' you decide to bring it in because you think you've found a way around it,' Schroeder asked. 'Come on!'
Binger replied: 'You can yell at me if you want. I was acting in good faith.' 
Judge Schroeder responded: 'I don't believe you. When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you. There better not be another incident.'
Rittenhouse's defense accused Binger of knowingly attempting to throw the proceeding because they were going badly for the state.
The defense on November 10 demanded a mistrial with prejudice, which would mean that Rittenhouse walks free and a retrial is not possible - a disaster for the prosecution. ",-2
169,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson described the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse as 'a wonderful moment,' praising the jury and insisting it was a day to celebrate - while left-leaning news anchors labeled the verdict a sorry moment in US history.
Carlson, who on Monday will broadcast the first televised interview with Rittenhouse, showed his producers in the car with Rittenhouse as they drove away from the courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday afternoon.
Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by a jury on Friday of all five charges stemming from the death of two protesters, shot and killed by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020.
At the end of the two-week trial, the jury decided that Rittenhouse acted in self defense amid chaotic scenes, with riots in the city sparked by the police shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake.
'The jury reached the correct verdict,' Rittenhouse told Carlson's team.
'Self defense is not illegal. I am glad they reached the correct verdict.'
The teenager added: 'It's been a tough journey but we made it through.
'We made it through the hard part.'
Carlson, one of Rittenhouse's strongest champions, praised the jury for their 'enormous moral courage' and described it as 'a significant day in US history.'
On other networks, the response was distinctly different.
Chris Cuomo, on CNN, said that Rittenhouse had been 'weaponized' by Carlson, whom he described as 'one of the most toxic and divisive people in our society'.
Cuomo said he thought the verdict was right, however. 
'While he was not guilty, it was wrong and hurtful and people are dead and we shouldn't be celebrating,' Cuomo said.
'The law rules. And the law here is the bad guy. That self defense law is pitiful. He was allowed to carry that rifle under the law.' 
His CNN colleague Don Lemon said: 'We should respect the justice system in Kenosha. The laws that are in place are the main reason he was acquitted.
'It is hard to separate race from this case. It may not be the main issue, but it was there.'
He later added: 'Race is definitely a part of this.' 
Chuck Todd, a host on MSNBC, said that he felt the verdict emboldened people to carry guns at protests. 
'The next time there's a protest of some sort, and it may get politicized, that gun owners, with a certain ideology may feel incentivized now, may feel even emboldened,' Todd said. 
'Anyone who supports Black Lives Matter should be very afraid after this,' said Joy-Ann Reid, another MSNBC host. 
Nicolle Wallace attempted to put Rittenhouse in the same category as domestic terrorists.
'The Kyle Rittenhouse acquittal today - not guilty on all counts - did not happen in a cultural vacuum,' she said.
'There's alarming context to this moment we're considering and talking about.
'Last week, the department of homeland security released its latest bulletin warning Americans, again, of the ongoing threat posed by domestic violent extremists.
'We should also point out conservative media for many, many months have been priming its audience for this moment, framing Rittenhouse as a hero.' 
Carlson accused the Left of having 'endorsed mob violence' and said Rittenhouse was a patriot protecting his father's hometown. 
'The jury confirmed what was obvious from the very beginning,' said Carlson.
'It was a wonderful moment.'
He said it showed that 'propaganda doesn't always win. Today it was soundly defeated - thank God.' 
And he criticized rival networks for their framing of the trial in racial terms.
'It doesn't have anything to do with anything,' Carlson said.
'But it's been a fixation of the Democratic party.
'They try to racialize everything,' he said, accusing them of 'trying to whip people into a frenzy'. 
His guest, Brazil-based journalist Glenn Greenwald, remarked that three of Brazil's top newspapers had to apologize for referring to Rittenhouse's victims as being black.  
Sean Hannity, also on Fox News, responded: 'My message to Kyle Rittenhouse tonight: Sue them all, starting with the president.
'This was a clear cut case of self-defense. We do not operate under mob rule.
'If anyone at fake news CNN or MSNBC had an ounce of decency they would apologize. They are con artists. They are always wrong; they always rush to judgement.'
Hannity said that Rittenhouse should sue Biden after the then-candidate last year posted a tweet, after a campaign debate, labelling Rittenhouse a white supremacist.  
Geraldo Rivera, Hannity's guest, got into a blazing row about whether Rittenhouse should sue Joe Biden - with Judge Jeanine Pirro yelling from the sidelines.
Rivera said the suggestion of suing the president was 'absurd'. 
Hannity replied: 'It's okay to call somebody a white supremacist with no facts?'
'May I finish the sentence?' Rivera continued. 'The person that Rittenhouse should sue first is the guy who was his original attorney who sought to make a political statement who dragged this 17-year-old kid to the bar with the Proud Boys and allowed this narrative of white supremacy.'
'Oh, cut it out, Geraldo!' Pirro shouted.
'That's ridiculous,' Hannity said. 
'I want to know if you refer to somebody who is not a white supremacist and not a public figure, and you call them a white supremacist, that's not defamation?'
Rivera replied: 'Sean, what you and I get called every day…'
Hannity retorted: 'He's not a public figure.'
The argument continued for several minutes. 
Hannity's other guest, Miranda Devine, said that the case was 'a modern day To Kill a Mockingbird,' and that Rittenhouse's lawyer was Atticus Finch.
She said it was about a poor, 'defenseless' man who took on the system.
'That poor kid,' she said.
'My heart went out to him. I really hope he can get on with his life.
'He deserves to be vindicated, and allowed to get on with his life.' 
Cori Bush, a congresswoman for Missouri and member of 'The Squad' described Rittenhouse's acquittal as 'white supremacy in action'.
'This system isn't built to hold white supremacists accountable,' she said. 
'It's why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free. 
'I'm hurt. I'm angry. I'm heartbroken.'
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agreed, tweeting: 'What we are witnessing is a system functioning as designed and protecting those it was designed for.'
Fellow Squad member Ayanna Pressley added: 'Racism & white supremacy remain the bedrock of our legal system. My heart breaks for the family & loved ones of those whose lives were stolen, and the trauma our communities face today and every day. 
'The struggle for accountability, for justice, for healing goes on.' 
The head of the House Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they're not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people.' ",-2
170,"Left-leaning celebrities took to Twitter to voice their outrage over Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal on murder charges, with legendary performer Bette Midler calling it a ‘tragic day’ and others bemoaning a perceived miscarriage of justice.
Midler fumed at Friday’s verdict to her 2 million followers, saying: ‘#kylerittenhouse found not guilty tho we SAW HIM kill two.
‘Fundamentally stupid, I predict he will go on to a big career on #Fox and in #RadicalRightWing circles, which counts as a plus with them. A tragic, tragic day for decent, THINKING, feeling, ethical people everywhere.’
 Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.     
Donald Trump was one of the few voices in Rittenhouse's camp as he congratulated Rittenhouse, a supporter of the former president, for beating the rap.  
 'Congratulations to Kyle Rittenhouse for being found INNOCENT of all charges,' said Trump in an emailed statement.
‘It’s called being found NOT GUILTY - And by the way, if that’s not self defense, nothing is!' 
 However, his voice was drowned out by a slew of TV and movie stars expressing outrage over Rittenhouse’s vindication. 
Talk show house Andy Cohen summed up his thoughts in five words, tweeting: ‘What in the actual f***.’
Actress Sophia Bush – who is not related to the political dynasty – was as succinct.
‘No words,’ she tweeted to her 1.2 million followers. ‘Just fury.’
She included an illustration that depicted Rittenhouse bragging about the killings to his bar pals and later appearing to sob over his actions in court.
Actress Rosanna Arquette said the ruling prompted her to lose faith in the legal process.
‘I have no faith in the justice system In America today,’ she tweeted. ‘I don’t want to live in a country that is ruled by violent ignorant racists.’
Rittenhouse could be seen smiling in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse Friday afternoon after being cleared of all charges.
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz.
Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, reacted to the verdict in a series of tweets.
‘I know so many are weary and tired,’ she tweeted. ‘But justice is not just about verdicts.
‘It is a continuum. We can galvanize around changing our culture, including challenging the difference in how a Black male teen would have been engaged in Kenosha.’
She later added: ‘I believe that it’s extremely important that we get back to the reason why people were even protesting in Kenosha - Police Brutality.’
Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly was one of the few luminaries that said the jury got it right.
‘Justice was done,’ she tweeted. ‘Kyle Rittenhouse was unfairly maligned by a dishonest press, and politicians who used him to advance their own fortunes.
‘If there are riots, these smear merchants will shoulder much of the blame.’  ",-2
171,"Kyle Rittenhouse is now a free man, but he's far from leaving the spotlight.
Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson revealed Friday that there was a Fox Nation crew filming for a Tucker Carlson Original documentary that will appear on the streaming platform in December. He will also sit down with Rittenhouse this Monday during Fox News Channel primetime for the young man's first televised interview following his not guilty verdict.
But Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, told CNN he 'did not approve of that,' referring to the film crew being with Rittenhouse during the trial, and even 'threw them out of the room several times.' 
'I don't think a film crew is appropriate for something like this, but the people who were raising the money to pay for the experts and to pay for the attorneys were trying to raise money and that was part of it, so I think, I don't want to say an evil but a definite distraction was part of it,' he told Chris Cuomo Friday. 'I didn't approve of it but I'm not always the boss.'
Rittenhouse, 18, was found not guilty Friday of all charges against him after a highly publicized, contentious trial that has split the nation. He smiled in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse after being declared not guilty, later commenting that 'self-defense is not illegal.'
Tucker himself referred to the verdict Friday as 'a wonderful moment,' praising the jury and insisting 'all of us should be celebrating.' 
The film crew and upcoming documentary raise questions about just what influence Carlson - one of the nation's most-watched cable news hosts and highly influential conservative commentator - had on Rittenhouse in the lead-up to and during the trial, and whether or not Rittenhouse was or will be paid for the documentary.

'It's the stuff that keeps you up at night, like... once you finally do get to sleep, your dreams are about what happened and you're waking up in a dark, cold sweat,' Rittenhouse begins in the trailer for the Fox Nation documentary that was posted Friday mere hours after the verdict.
'You had dreams about what happened?' someone can be heard asking Rittenhouse.
'Every single night,' the teen says. '... I'm alive, but what would have happened, like what if I wasn't alive, or what if I did let Mr. [Joseph] Rosenbaum steal my gun?'
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. 
'Almost every outcome is either me getting seriously injured or hurt or dead,' Rittenhouse says in the trailer. 
'Those are just the dreams I have on a daily basis,' he adds, with the preview then cutting to footage of the verdict being read on Friday.  
The teen had collapsed in tears and hugged his attorney as the jury in his double murder trial acquitted him of all charges after four days of deliberation and weeks of testimony. The verdict came in at 12:15 p.m. Friday in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  
'The jury reached the correct verdict,' Rittenhouse told Fox News.
'Self-defense is not illegal. I am glad they reached the correct verdict.' 
He added: 'It's been a tough journey but we made it through. We made it through the hard part.'
The vindicated teen will sit down with Fox News Channel for his first TV interview on Monday at 8 p.m. ET, Carlson said. 
Part of the interview will air that evening, while the remaining portion will be included in Tucker Carlson Originals, the news network said.
Carlson has publicly sympathized with Rittenhouse in the past. 
'People in charge from the governor of Wisconsin on down refused to enforce the law,' he said in August 2020.
'They stood back and watched Kenosha burn. So are we really surprised this looting and arson accelerated to murder? How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?' 
Outside the court on Friday, Richards said his client was feeling a 'huge sense of relief' at the verdict.
'He is on his way home, he wants to get on with his life,' Richards said. 'He has to get on with his life the best he can.' 
The lawyer said he believed the Rittenhouse family would move out of the area because of the number of death threats they have received.
'Kyle is in counseling for PTSD. He doesn't sleep at night,' he said. 
'Eventually some anonymity will come back to him but I don't think he will continue to live in this area,' his lawyer continued.
'I think it's too dangerous,' Richards added. He explained that Rittenhouse has had security following him around the clock 'since this happened.' 
He said Rittenhouse and his team have received a 'scary' amount of death threats. 
Richards revealed that the defense team had two mock trials, one with Rittenhouse giving testimony and one without, and it was clear from the jury reaction that he had to go on the stand. 
He also said the jury deliberations were longer than any other case he had been involved in.
Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted in the killings, his lawyer said the teen plans to become a nurse. 
Shortly before he traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, armed with an AR-15 - where he shot and killed two protesters on August 25, 2000 - Rittenhouse gave an interview to right-wing news outlet The Daily Caller. 
Armed with a rifle slung across his body, the teen told the outlet that he was a certified EMT and said he was patrolling the streets of Kenosha to provide medical attention to anyone in need and was helping protect local businesses from looters and rioters. 
'People are getting injured. Our job is to protect this business and part of my job is to also help people,' Rittenhouse said of his militia at the time.  
'If there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way,' added Rittenhouse, who was seen earlier guarding a local car shop with a group of armed militia members. 
'That's why I have my rifle because I can protect myself, obviously. I also have my med kit.'
He also claimed he had been 'de-escalating' a potentially violent situation earlier in the night, during which he and the rest of his vigilante crew ordered protesters to leave a church that they had targeted.  
After the trial, Rittenhouse's lawyer took out his anger on prosecutor Thomas Binger. 
'Justice is done when the truth is reached. Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth. It's not about winning,' Richards said.
But he praised Judge Bruce Schroeder, saying he had presided over a 'fair trial.'
'He gives you a fair trial as a defendant - but you don't want him to sentence your client,' he said, commenting on his reputation for handing out stiff sentences.
'If we had lost, we know what would happen, he would have gotten life in prison. We asked for a fair trial and we got one.'
He defended Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the from a tumbler the jurors who would become alternates, saying the defense team was 'devastated' that three of the jurors they considered most on their side were barred from the final deliberations.
Binger had made it clear earlier in the week that he would not comment on the outcome of the case.
But his boss, Kenosha County District Attorney Mike Graveley, issued a statement saying: 'We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations.
'Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.'
Graveley added a plea for calm: 'We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.' 
The Rittenhouse shootings took place during 2020 summertime riots two days after Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot when police officers responded to a 'family trouble' around 5:15 p.m. August 23, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Kenosha was again on edge Friday as protesters from both sides milled about on the courthouse steps after the verdict. 
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that had threatened to derail proceedings more than once. 
President Joe Biden said Friday that he stands by the jury's verdict - as Republicans renewed demands that he apologize for calling the Kenosha shooter a white supremacist in the wake of the shootings.
'I stand by with the jury as the jury system has concluded. The jury system works and you have to abide by it,' Biden told reporters Friday afternoon as he returned to the White House from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had a routine physical.
He said he 'just heard a moment ago' about the verdict, adding he 'didn't watch' the trial, which featured dramatic clashes between the prosecution and defense lawyers and testimony by the accused teen in an event that got gavel-to-gavel cable news coverage. 
Republican lawmakers and other officials are demanding that Biden apologize to Rittenhouse for linking him to white supremacists while campaigning for president. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said in a statement immediately after the verdict.
Before he gained infamy, Rittenhouse was a hot-tempered student at Lakes Community High School, his former classmates said.
'When he got mad or offended he would always say he could ""f***me up,"" but everyone would just laugh because he was like a 5-foot-4 chubby freshman boy who we thought wasn't capable of harm,' a student told Vice right after the shooting in August 2020.
Other classmates told the outlet that Rittenhouse was fond of police, guns, former President Donald Trump and 'triggering the libs.' 
Rittenhouse was born January 3, 2000, to parents Wendy and Mike and grew up in a broken home after the couple split.
Wendy Rittenhouse, a single mom of three, struggled to make ends meet and the family was evicted numerous times, The New Yorker reported.
She filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and was hospitalized with a gastrointestinal bleed, prompting her son to find work as a fry cook and janitor to support the family financially, the outlet said.
When he was in ninth grade, the aspiring first responder joined an 'explorers program' at the Grayslake Police Department in Illinois, which the local police chief said was meant to 'teach self-discipline, responsibility and other appropriate life lessons to troubled teens,' the magazine reported.
He also enrolled in a cadet program at the Antioch Fire Department, with Chief Jon Cokefair telling The New Yorker: 'Most of the kids that are doing this, they don't play football, they're not cheerleaders. This is their focus.'
By all accounts, Rittenhouse seemed to idolize the police.
Before Rittenhouse's Facebook account was deactivated, it reflected the young man's admiration for law enforcement, which he praised heavily on social media.
In a photograph posted by his mother, Kyle is seen wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform and the kind of brimmed hat state troopers wear. 
Records show that in January 2017, his mom claimed a classmate of her son's had been calling him 'dumb' and 'stupid' and threatening him as she sought an order of protection from police.  
Rittenhouse was identified in court papers as a lifeguard at a YMCA in Lindenhurst, Illinois. 
In January 2020, Rittenhouse sat front row at a Trump rally in Des Moines, Iowa. 
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.

COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
DISMISSED - COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it",-2
172,"As a physical education teacher in Loudoun County, Virginia, I serve a very diverse community in Leesburg. I love and respect all my students and treat them with dignity despite our differences.
My recent court win is an important step toward protecting freedom of expression for everyone. My hope is that it will encourage educators across the nation to freely advocate for their students without fear of consequence. Some Americans have lost sight of the importance of open debate. 
The Loudoun County School Board recently passed a policy that forces teachers to call students by pronouns that are contrary to biology and violate my faith as a Christian.
The policy forces me and my colleagues to subject the very children that we are charged to love and protect to a dangerous ideology that could lead to puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and even sterilization.
While the policy was still under review, I took the time, in my personal capacity, to speak at a school board meeting that was open to the public. I told board members that, as a teacher, I cannot lie to these kids—no good teacher would. However, the policy would force me to do just that, and I urged them to rethink it.
Two days later, I got a call to come into Human Resources, where I was informed that I was being suspended for ‘disruptive behavior.’
I didn’t understand what was disruptive about expressing my concern for my students at a public school-board meeting in the county where I live and pay taxes. I later came to learn that the disruption they were referring to was five parents’ e-mails sent to my school complaining about my speech at the school board meeting. 
As a result of the e-mails, the school board determined that it was enough to jeopardize my family’s livelihood and my future as a teacher. Think about the implications of a school board giving into such demands so quickly—simply as a result of a teacher’s views. 
Freedom of expression is a core liberty and a human right, and the school board was trying to take that away from me. I decided to stand up for what I believe in, and to protect my students. I was fortunate to have the assistance of Alliance Defending Freedom to challenge the violation I was facing and defend my rights in court.
First, the court temporarily ordered the school board to reinstate my job. The Virginia Supreme Court later upheld that order. Now the school district has agreed to settle my case.
As part of that settlement, the trial court permanently prohibited the Loudoun County School Board from punishing me for expressing my views. Teachers are just like everyone else; we have legitimate ideas and views we should be free to peacefully express. No government should be able to force its citizens to say things they disagree with.  
This is especially true in schools, where the marketplace of ideas should be fiercely protected, both for the sake of freedom and the sake of truth. The court has vindicated those rights for me and for all teachers. I can now confidently continue teaching at Leesburg Elementary School without fear of punishment for expressing my views.
It’s been a long, emotional journey up to this point, but I know it’s worth pursuing. As exhausting as it is, I know there’s still more work to be done to truly protect freedom in Loudoun County.
The school board adopted the policy I objected to, Policy 8040, and two of my colleagues, Monica Gill and Kimberly Wright, have joined me to take a bold stand to see that the same rights that we have outside the school are protected inside the school. Our constitutionally protected freedoms don’t vanish when we walk through the school doors.
Monica, Kimberly, and I know that not every parent sees things the way that we do, and we respect that. But some would rather see certain voices silenced or, even worse, compelled to speak in ways that violate our deeply held faith, instead of being allowed to engage in the debate.
Call it cancel culture, call it censorship, call it what you want—all of our freedoms are threatened when the culturally accepted narrative is the only option for discussion.
America is large and diverse, and some of us don’t agree with the ideas that are touted as truth by cable news networks, Hollywood executives, or political leaders. We shouldn’t be singled out for censorship. 
Parents should be allowed to have a say in what goes on in their kids’ schools. We recently witnessed a regime change in the Virginia governor’s office, in part because parents in our commonwealth are waking up to what’s going on.
As a result of what was happening here in Loudoun County, many parents saw that it was time for a change to protect their children from these harmful and radical ideologies. If we’re allowed to debate ideas, kids will learn how to value people while engaging with different opinions in a respectful way. 
Silencing opposing voices only teaches kids that you can get your way by bullying others. Teachers and parents have unique viewpoints when it comes to topics like efforts to control COVID-19 outbreaks, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity ideology. 
In my case, the Loudoun County Court took us a big step closer toward allowing those viewpoints to be voiced without punishment. I love all my students, and I enjoy teaching them health and physical education. In my classroom, every student will continue to be treated with dignity, respect, and care. 
This is much more than a job for me; it is who I am. I don’t see myself as a rebel or revolutionary. I’m just a P.E. teacher who cares deeply about the health and future of my students. Monica, Kimberly, and I are taking a stand for what we believe is right and good for all Americans, not just us.",-2
173,"A junior who played on a winning basketball team stayed behind with arena staff for three hours to help clean up the stands and pick up the trash left behind by fans.
Dexter Dennis who is known for his for his fast moves on the court was praised for what he did off the court long after the game, held  in Wichita, Kansas, was over.
Dennis who was on the Wichita State University men's basketball team that beat Tarleton State 65-51 decided to help tidy up the stadium after the game instead of heading off to celebrate the victory with teammates.
Dennis, who hails from Louisiana, helped propel the team, known as the Shockers to victory and into a tournament in Las Vegas. 
Dennis scored 13 points, 10 of those in the second half, for Wichita State (3-0). He was 3-of-4 from 3-point range. 
Wichita State shot 42.9 percent from the field, and Tarleton State finished at 38.3 percent. 
But it was Dennis' humble act long after the spectators had gone home that got people talking. 
The simple act of him staying behind to pick up trash was captured by a reporter who was in the stands opposite after everyone else had left the court. 
The cleanup can normally takes up to three hours.  
'Dexter is a different kind of dude,' sports reporter for The Wichita Eagle, Taylor Eldridge, tweeted together with the video he shot that has since gone viral. 
'Wasn't in trouble or anything. Didn't have to. He just wanted to help out the cleaning crew,' Eldridge added. 
Dennis tweeted about the incident stating: 'Didn't do it for attention. Just gives me perspective on life. It could always be worse.' 
His efforts were recognized by Wichita State University Facilities Director David Gomez.
'We have several folks who have been here for decades and I know for some of them, that's probably the first time they've seen something like that happen,' said Gomez to CBS News. 
'And I just, from our custodial staff, out to him, we just want to say thank you for leading and showing us that there are still folks out there who recognize the hard work that's done around here.' ",-2
174,"A nine-year-old girl who fought off a robber by punching him in the face after he attached her mother and tried to steal her purse is being honored for her bravery by Florida police who say they’re proud of her crime-fighting actions.
Journee Nelson and her mom, Danielle Mobley, were running errands in West Palm Beach on November 2 when they were attacked outside Sabor Tropical Supermarket.
Surveillance footage shows a man lunging toward Mobley as the two return to their parked car.
Without hesitation, little Journee races to the aid of her mom, pummeling the thief as he tries to steal the woman’s purse.
‘I fought back,’ the girl told 7 News Miami. ‘I had to save my mom.’
Chief Frank Adderley said during a press conference Thursday that while he wouldn’t recommend confronting criminals, the girl’s actions were understandable during the heat of the moment.
‘I bet he was shocked when she hit him right on the face,’ Adderly told reporters. ‘You definitely could tell on the video tape he was not expecting that. Her actions were perfect timing in this particular situation.
‘I think she hit him pretty hard.’
Police her heroic actions during the brazen daytime robbery with a certificate of bravery and Target gift card.
Her mom told reporters that Journee stepped in to help shortly after the robber knocked her to the ground.
‘I’m very proud of her, that [helping] was her initial reaction,’ Mobley said. ‘I wish things could be a little different because she is still dealing with this mentally.’
She said Journee chased the man down the block as he made off with her purse.
‘She actually jumped up and chased him four houses down the block with me chasing her, calling her back,’ her mom said.

175,"The Roy Family in HBO's Succession owns a huge array of properties - from luxury New York City apartments to lavish summer houses in the Hamptons, and FEMAIL has uncovered all of the real homes that they used to film the hit show - including a mansion that was once owned by Henry Ford's grandson and an apartment in the iconic Woolworth Building.
The series follows billionaire Logan Roy - who is the head of media conglomerate Waystar Royco - and his three sons, as they fight over who will soon take control of the company. 
The family certainly lives a glamorous lifestyle - taking private helicopter rides whenever they please and jetting off on vacations all the time - which is why it's no surprise that their homes are just as magnificent as their way of life.
The characters live in a range of breathtaking condos, mansions, and villas across New York state. Ranging from a $23 million apartment in Manhattan to a $105 million manor in the Hamptons, FEMAIL has revealed all of the properties that posed as the various backdrops for the Roy family throughout season three of the drama. 
Some of the homes are currently on the market, so you can live like a Roy yourself - if you're willing to cough up millions of dollars, that is. 
RAVA ROY'S APARTMENT
In the show, Kendall Roy (played by Jeremy Strong) spends much of his time at his ex-wife Rava Roy's (played by Natalie Gold) lush New York City apartment. It turns out, they filmed those scenes at Pavilion A in the iconic Woolworth building in Tribeca. 
The duplex property is located on the 29th floor of 2 Park Place. The five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom condo spans more than 6,700-square-feet.
It boasts 22-foot ceilings, six skylights, two powder rooms, a 52-foot living room, and a 2,800-square-foot private outdoor terrace with breathtaking views of downtown.
The kitchen includes custom-made cabinetry by DADA - the luxury Italian furniture giant - as well as marble countertops, a wine fridge, and two dishwashers.
As if one open kitchen is not enough, there’s also a mini-kitchen in the master suite, which also has private access to the terrace and a walk-in closet.
The master bathroom has a steam shower, a soaking tub, dual vanity sinks, and radiant heat floors. 
The duplex is currently on the market - first going on sale in 2019 for $30 million, but later dropping to $23.3 million in October 2021. 
Residents of the building have access to many amenities, including a spa with a sauna and hot tub, a private swimming pool, a fitness studio, a wine cellar, and a tasting room. 
The building also features a residential lobby that has been fully restored from retail mogul Frank W. Woolworth's private office, where he cemented his legacy in the Big Apple.  
Woolworth's building, nicknamed 'The Cathedral of Commerce,' housed a Woolworth's in the first one-and-a-half floors.
The company also kept its headquarters in the tower until 1997, when it was eventually run out of business by a new generation of retail competitors, such as Walmart. 
The 792-foot skyscraper was designed by Cass Gilbert and completed in 1913. It was the tallest building in the world for 17 years.
Its lower 28 floors are now office spaces, while the 32 luxury units above just completed a five-year renovation overseen by famed French architect Thierry W. Despont.
The prices of the luxury condos ranged from $3.5 million to $79 million. The building is located beside City Hall Park, Brookfield Place, and the Westfield World Trade Center. 
LOGAN ROY'S APARTMENT
As for Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox), and his third wife, Marcia 'Marcy' Roy's (played by Hiam Abbass) home, they live in a spacious Fifth Avenue townhouse located opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
It turns out, that apartment isn't actually real, but instead, it was a set created in Silvercup Studios. However, scenes that take place in the lobby of the townhouse were filmed in the American Irish Historical Society at 991 Fifth Avenue in New York City.
Production designer Stephen Carter told Architectural Digest that when designing the apartment, he was inspired by the homes of Edgar Bronfman and Charles Bronfman.
'I was influenced by the Fifth Avenue apartments of Edgar Bronfman and Charles Bronfman as they were on the same stretch of street where Logan’s apartment would be, particularly the simple muted color scheme from Charles’s apartment,' he explained.
'Edgar Senior’s apartment has the scale, views, and layout, but the color palette was pretty shocking to the eye.'
'The color palette was very clean and almost a bleached monotone of wealth. I didn’t feel these were very tactile people, comfort-wise, and they wanted everything around them to be visually elegant.' 
Decorator George DeTitta Jr. added that when decorating the apartment, they 'didn't want to draw overt attention to the family's wealth.'
'We didn’t want to draw overt attention to the family’s wealth with the decoration of the show, instead selecting a mix of pieces, both contemporary and antique, to tell the story of their elevated place in society more subtly,' he told Set Decorators. 
ROY FAMILY'S VACATION HOME
As do many wealthy people who live in the city, the Roy family have a vacation home in the glamorous beach-front neighborhood of the Hamptons, which they spend much of their time in. These scenes were filmed at the Henry Ford II's estate, which recently sold for $105 million.
The house, which is located at 90 Jule Pond Drive in Long Island, New York, is complete with 42-aces of land, a quarter mile of ocean frontage, access to three ponds, a meditation garden, and more.
The luxurious mansion was originally priced at $175 million when it was listed in 2017, and later reduced to $145 million before finally selling for $105 million this month. 
The Hamptons has long-been a summer enclave for some of New York's wealthiest residents, and many celebrities have even purchased homes of their own there - including Jimmy Buffett, Martha Stewart, Jon Bon Jovi, Paul Simon, Jerry Seinfeld, Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downy Jr., Sarah Jessica Parker, and Anderson Cooper. 
The house, which sits on Jule Pond, boasts nearly a quarter mile of Atlantic Ocean frontage - making it the largest ocean frontage in the Hamptons - and has access to three ponds and Mecox Bay. It has a gated entranceway and a long, tree-lined driveway. 
It was built in the early 1960s but underwent a major renovation in 2008. However, they kept many of the home's original details such as distinctive ceiling moldings, traditional chandeliers, Italian marble fireplaces, French parquet floors, and antique bathroom fixtures. 
The 20,000-square-foot house has 12 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms, two master suites, a chef's kitchen, a games room, a library, multiple reception rooms, and a 48-foot living room. There is also an entire wing of the house designed for staff members to live in, complete with its own entrance. 
Outside, it boasts a spa, a greenhouse, an outdoor kitchen, an outdoor shower, tennis courts, a basketball court, a guest house, a six-car garage, meditation gardens, and a 20-foot, heated, gunite pool - a concrete blend of sand, cement, and water that's known for it's long-lasting strength. 
It was sold by a portfolio manager named Brenda Earl, who had purchased the house in 2002 for $21.75 million from Italian financier Carlo Traglio. And even though she has spent millions on its refurbishment, she has still earned a big profit on the sale.    
The buyer is an offshore company based in the Cayman Islands, which is believed to be connected to Canadian swimmer Richard Funk's family, Dirt has reported. The sale has been classified as the second largest sale in Long Island. 
The property was once part of a 235-acre estate owned by famous car-maker Henry Ford's grandson. After he divorced from his wife, Anne McDonnell, she took control of the land and decided to break it up and sell it piece by piece. In 1975, she sold this part of the land for $1.8 million.  
JOSH AARONSON'S HOME 
In the fourth episode of season three, Kendall and Logan went to visit one of their biggest investors, Josh Aaronson (played by Adrien Brody) at his mansion - which is located on a private island. It turns out, the home that they filmed these scenes in isn't actually located on a private island, in fact, it's also located in the Hamptons.
Sitting at 115 Beach Lane in Wainscott, New York, the 11,000-square-foot house has six bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. It was designed by Barnes Coy Architects and has 2-acres of land.  
Floor-to-ceiling tempered glass windows, 22-foot-tall ceilings, a steam room (complete with a sauna), a recreational room, a gym, a floating staircase, an elevator, and a golf simulator can also be found in the house.
Outside, there are several seaside decks, an infinity pool, an outdoor kitchen, a dining table, and a seaside living room.
The current owners initially purchased the home in 2015 for $16.5 million. They listed it for $52 million earlier this year, but took it off the market a few months later. 
Stephen told Architectural Digest that when looking for a place to portray Josh's mansion, he felt it was important to find a home that appeared isolated so that it would seem like it was on a private island, and this one was perfect.
'If you know that Hamptons coast, you know that it’s built up within an inch of its life,' he said. 'One of the nice things about this property is that once you get out onto the pool deck, you sense that there might not be too many other buildings close by.'
He said filming took place over one day, and that they had to make minimal changes to the décor, which includes a white sectional sofa, and a dining area with six leather chairs. 
'You’ve got these great views out toward the beach. You have great light coming in. One of the things we try to do on the show is to create [the suggestion of] wealth through an abundance of space, light, and [ceiling] height in every situation,' he continued.
'You want to feel that these people don’t have the creative wherewithal to connect personally to the things in their lives. They’re not out combing flea markets looking for the perfect midcentury piece. They’re hiring decorators.'
ROY FAMILY'S ITALIAN HOLIDAY HOME
In the last two episodes of season three, the Roy family jetted off to Italy for vacation. They rented out a glamorous home in Tuscany, and they filmed the scenes at a 17th century villa, called Villa Centinale.
The villa was built in 1680 and designed by the late architect Carlo Fontana. It is now owned by a man named Edward Lambton, who rents it out as a vacation home from $30,742.
Tucked into a wooded hillside in Italy, it has 13 bedrooms across five floors, and many of the rooms contain beautiful paintings and murals on the walls and ceilings. 
The property also boasts two swimming pools, two kitchens, a game room, a gym, and tennis courts. To make things even better, there are staff onsite at all times - including a house manager, a chef, maids, and a porter. ",-2

177,"Colombia's President Ivan Duque apologised on Friday after police cadets dressed up as Nazis for a 'cultural exchange' event in honour of Germany.
Photos of the ceremony were shared Thursday on an official police Twitter account.
In it, students are seen dressed in the grey-green uniform of the Wehrmacht, one of them sporting a small, Adolf Hitler-style moustache.
Others are dressed in the black uniform of the SS, complete with the red swastika armband.
The black, red and yellow German flag and balloons in the same colours decorated the venue that also featured a replica Luftwaffe plane, copies of Nazi firearms, and swastikas on the table cloths.
Two police officers in Colombian uniforms inaugurated the event by cutting a ribbon, the pictures showed.
'From the SimonBolivar police academy in the city of Tulua, we are organising an #InternationalWeek with guest country #Germany. 
'With these cultural exchanges, we are strengthening the knowledge of our police students,' proclaimed the police Twitter account.
The photos were met with a mixture of anger and incredulity on social media, provoking deep embarrassment for the authorities.
'Any apology for Nazism is unacceptable and I condemn any demonstration that uses or refers to symbols referring to those responsible for the Jewish Holocaust that claimed the lives of more than 6 million people,' Duque said on Twitter on Friday.
The police dismissed the head of the academy.
The Defense Ministry, under whose umbrella the Colombian police falls, said in a statement that its training guidelines 'do not envisage in any way an activity such as the one which took place yesterday.'
The German and Israeli embassies in Bogota issued a joint statement expressing 'total rejection of any form of apology or demonstration of Nazism.'
Under fire internationally for its brutal suppression of anti-government protests earlier this year, the Colombian police has embarked on a 'transformation' campaign to improve its image, which will include a uniform change.",-2
178,"Seven migrants have been killed and eight others injured after the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in lost control and crashed near a motorway toll station in northern Greece, authorities said.
Police said the vehicle carrying 15 people had been travelling on a motorway from the area of Greece's north-eastern border with Turkey towards the north's main city of Thessaloniki when it crashed just after midnight.
The vehicle had been travelling at high speed and the driver lost control as he tried to exit the motorway, hitting a toll booth and crashing into a nearby storage container, police said.
The injured were four men from Pakistan, one from Afghanistan and two from Nepal, as well as the 35-year-old Moldovan driver, who police suspect was acting as a smuggler.
They have been transported to hospitals in the north-eastern Greek towns of Xanthi and Komotini.
The seven people killed in the crash included one woman.
Their nationalities were not immediately known, authorities said.
Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
The most frequently used routes for clandestine entries into Greece are the short but dangerous sea crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands, or crossing the heavily guarded land border between Greece and Turkey.",-2
179,"A New Jersey high school football coach has been suspended after police body cam footage showed the half-naked and disorientated man trespassing on school grounds earlier this month. 
Asbury Park High's Nick Famularo, 26, was found without pants at the school's stadium on November 6 after locking himself out of his girlfriend's car. Police responding to help the coach also found human feces and vomit in the football team's locker room.   
The school board on Thursday voted to put Famularo on paid administrative leave, along with Athletic Director Mark Gerbino, assistant football coach Lamar Davenport and gym teacher and assistant coach Matt Ardizzone, New Jersey Advance Media reported.  
The suspensions will remain in effect as the school board and police continue to investigate the incident. 
The Asbury Park school district did not immediately reply to DailyMail.com's request for comment.  
According to the police report, three officers found Famularo without pants at the stadium at 2:21 a.m. on November 6. One of the officers reportedly went to high school with Famularo and tried to assist the disorientated man.   
Famularo, who has served as the head football coach since last year, was reportedly locked out of his vehicle, but because the car was registered to his girlfriend, police could not unlock it for him. 
Famularo's girlfriend then arrived to pick him up, and a woman then walked out of the stadium to give him back his facility keys, cellphone, jacket and car keys. 
Ardizzone was at the scene as well and helped police enter the football team's locker room, where they found vomit on students' jerseys and human feces on the rug. 
Asbury Park police spokesman Mike Casey told NJ Advance Media that there is an on-going internal investigating regarding a body camera violation during the officers' interactions with Famularo. 
Famularo graduated from Asbury High in 2013 and took over the position of head coach from Tim Fosque in 2020. He was a football player and wrestler at the high school before going on to play at South Carolina State University and Delaware University. 
He was previously a substitute teacher and assistant wrestling coach at Asbury High, APP reported.
Hours after the incident, Famularo went on to coach the Asbury Park Blue Bishops against a rival high school, and Gerbino claims he was not aware of the incident until after the game. 
While Famularo's suspension was expected, some said the district was going too far in punishing Gerbino, Ardizzone and Davenport. 
'Those assistant coaches and the athletic director have done more for these kids than anyone, and way before (Famularo) came into the district,' said Lynn Johnson, a kindergarten teacher in the Asbury Park school district for the past 21 years.
Asbury Park Education Association President John Napolitani criticized the suspensions, calling them 'unprofessional' during Thursday's board meeting. 
'The two assistant coaches and the athletic director are being railroaded and this is a witch hunt. There's no reason they should be suspended,' he said. ",-2
180,"Art LaFleur, who was best known for playing the spirit of baseball legend Babe Ruth in the family-friendly comedy The Sandlot, has died at age 78.
LaFleur's wife Shelley LaFleur announced his death on Thursday in a Facebook post in which she said he had died from 'A-typical Parkinson's.'
The actor, who battled the disease for a decade, also had significant roles in Field Of Dreams and classic television shows including M.A.S.H. and The Incredible Hulk.
LaFleur had a long list of television credits, with appearances on The A-Team, Baywatch, Coach, Doogie Howser, ER, Hill Street Blues, Home Improvement, House, JAG, Northern Exposure, Malcolm in the Middle, The Mentalist and Thirtysomething.
In The Sandlot, he played a dream version of Babe Ruth who inspired a young baseball fan.
'Remember kid, there’s heroes and there’s Legends. Heroes get remembered, but Legends never die!' he says during a pep talk from beyond the grave. 
The actor also appeared in another baseball-themed movie, the Kevin Costner–starring drama Field Of Dreams, as Chick Gandil, one of the leaders of the 1919 Black Sox scandal. 
LaFleur was born in Gary, Indiana, in 1943, and he went on to play football at the University of Kentucky in the early 1960s.
It wasn't until the late 1970s that he got his start in the film and television industry as an actor, after initially moving to Hollywood to become a screenwriter.
His first on-screen credit was for the 1978 TV movie Rescue From Gilligan's Island, and he followed that up with guest appearances on Charlie's Angels, Lou Grant and M.A.S.H. 
His other high-profile film roles were in the cult-classic horror remake of The Blob from 1988 and the Sylvester Stallone police thriller Cobra from 1986.
In 2011, the Action on Film International Film Festival honored LaFleur for his role in the film Dahmer vs. Gacy. 
In her Facebook statement, LaFleur's widow referred to him as 'the love of my life.' 
'He brought laughter to so many people,' she continued as she listed some of his most popular film roles. 'He was a generous and selfless man which carried over to his acting but more importantly it was who he was for his family and friends. 
'Every location or set we visited him on, the cast and crew would introduce themselves and tell [his children] Molly, Joe, and me how Art spoke of us with such pride and love,' she continued, adding that they had been together for 43 years. ",-2
181,"An Air Force pilot was killed and two others injured Friday morning in a 'mishap' involving two trainer aircrafts at a Texas base.
Officials at Laughlin Air Force Base said an accident involving a pair T-38 Talon jets occurred on the runway around 10am.
One of the injured pilots was taken to San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center in critical condition. Their current condition remains unknown.
The other pilot was treated at Val Verde Regional Medical Center and discharged.  
The cause of the accident is still under investigation.
Friday's incident follows a string of fatal military accidents. 
Col. Craig Prather issued a statement, sharing his thoughts are with the victims and their families. 
'Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with our pilots involved in this mishap and their families,' he said.
The identities of the victims have not been released. 
The T-38 Talon is a two-seat, twin-engine, high-altitude, supersonic jet trainer. The Air Force says the jet is used in a variety of roles because of its 'design, economy of operations, ease of maintenance, high performance and exceptional safety record'.
The T-38 Talon is primarily used by Air Education and Training Command for joint specialized undergraduate pilot training. 
Air Combat Command, Air Force Materiel Command and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration also use the T-38A in various roles. 
Earlier this month, the US Navy fired a nuclear submarine's Commanding Officer, Executive Officer and Chief of the Boat for 'loss of confidence' after their vessel collided with an 'uncharted seamount' in the South China Sea.
The $3.1 billion USS Connecticut's CO Cmdr Cameron Aljilani, XO Lt Cmdr Patrick Cashin and COB Cory Rodgers were relieved of their positions on November 3. 
A statement from the Navy said that the October 2 crash, which injured 11 crew members, could have been prevented with 'sound judgement, prudent decision-making and adherence to required procedures in navigation planning'.
An investigation determined the USS Connecticut grounded on an uncharted seamount while operating in international waters in the Indo-Pacific region.
The training mission, which consists of a special-operations unit and contingent of Marines is believed to have been in operation for at least a year. 
Three interim officers were ordered to fill in and the Seawolf-class submarine is reportedly in Guam 'undergoing damage assessment' overseen by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  
Last month, a Fort Hood soldier was unresponsive behind his company barracks and declared dead shortly after.
Specialist Maxwell Hockin, 26, joined the military in 2017 and was most recently assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.  
Hockin earned a number of decorations, including the Army Good Conduct medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, National Defense Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon, and was said to have 'an excellent work ethic'.
His death is the latest in a string of incidents involving soldiers connected to Fort Hood, with 31 people having died in 2020 alone.
In September, a military training jet crashed into a residential area of Lake Worth, Texas, leaving three homes damaged and two pilots injured after they ejected from the plane - with one in critical condition after  landing on power lines. 
The pilots, an instructor and a student, were using the aircraft as part of a military training course near Corpus Christi International Airport. The instructor pilot was in stable condition after being ejected in the neighborhood. 
A witness said the student pilot was engulfed in flames before he hit the powerlines. 
Video footage posted to Facebook showed the parachute wrapped around the overhead cables.
Debris damaged three Lake Worth homes with the plane being found in one of the backyards. 
The aircraft was a Navy T-45C Goshawk jet trainer aircraft that was assigned from Training Air Wing 2 at Naval Air Station in Kingsville, according to a statement from Chief of Naval Air Training.  
Friday's accident also follows reports of several fatal small plane crashes across the US this week.
A single-engine air tanker pilot was found dead Tuesday in Colorado after his plane crashed while fighting a wildfire near Rocky Mountain National Park.
The pilot, identified as Army and Air Force veteran Marc Thor Olson, had 42 years of flying experience. Olson was hired by the Larimer County Sheriff's Office to fight the wildfire because of its likelihood of a quick spread in dry, windy conditions. 
He was recruited because the blaze was too dangerous for firefighters to battle it on the ground, the Associated Press reported.
The plane dropped a load of water on the fire before Olson reported turbulent conditions and crashed.  
There were also two fatal plane crashes in Michigan this week. 
Four people died in a plane crash Saturday on Michigan's Beaver Island west of Mackinaw City. The twin-engine Britten-Norman plane was flying from Charlevoix, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. 
The second crash resulted in the deaths of Pilot Kenneth Daniel Yott, 61, of Pontiac and 21-year-old passenger Corbin Dennis Kennedy, of Howell.
The pair were found dead Monday afternoon in the Beechcraft King Air plane in a wooded area of Charlevoix County.
It is unclear what caused the crash, however authorities are investigating. ",-2
182,"The pilot of a small propeller plane called his sister-in-law to beckon her outside as he and his newlywed sister flew over the woman's Wisconsin home just five minutes before the wing of the aircraft clipped a house as he attempted an aerial loop, killing the siblings. 
Aaron Mika, 29, took his 21-year-old sister Aleah Miller for a flight in a the two-seater plane on October 23. Witnesses said the plane was flying 'pretty low' and 'performing aerial maneuvers' before it crashed, according to the Ashland County Sheriff's Department. 
Mika, who graduated with an engineering degree, had quit his firm and worked as a flight instructor and a float plane pilot in Alaska and California since 2020, according to his obituary. 
His sister got married just two weeks before the crash. 
The siblings flew from Ashland, where the pair grew up, to Marengo, about 40 miles away. 
Aaron's sister-in-law told the National Transportation Safety Board that Mika called her from the plane at her Marengo home around 2.30 pm, telling her to come outside to watch the little red-and-white plane fly overhead.
The plane passed over 'multiple times at a low altitude' as she watched, according to the organization's report on the accident, before Mika attempted an 'aerodynamic loop maneuver' midair, which was captured on video by a witness. 
After inverting at the top of the loop to fly upside-down, the plane righted itself as it descended. 
During the descent portion of the loop, before Mika could pull back up, the plane's right wing struck a nearby house and slammed nose-first into the ground near the stunned relative's home. 
Both of the plane's wings were torn off by the impact and found about 20 feet from where the fuselage came to rest. Both Mika and Miller were pronounced dead at the scene at approximately 2.40 pm.
No one on the ground injured. 
NTSB investigators inspected the crumpled remains of the aircraft and found no problems with the plane itself that would have caused or contributed to the crash, the report said. 
Mika graduated from the University of Minnesota-Duluth with a degree in civil engineering, and worked at engineering firm TKDA for several years before quitting to pursue his passion for flight. 
His family said he  was 'an avid investigator of all his world had to offer.'
Miller joined the National Guard shortly after graduating from high school in 2018 before attending the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire and setting out on an 18-month church mission to Utah. 
Upon returning she married the 'love of her life,' Kenneth James Miller, and planned to return to school to finish her degree. ",-2
183,"A gunman opened fire outside a Southern California mall Friday night, killing one man and wounding two others, including a child.
Witnesses said a man was found unresponsive near the entrance to the Mall of Victor Valley in Victorville after shots were fired near the shopping center.
First responders provided CPR to the victim, but despite their efforts, he was pronounced dead at the scene, the Victor Valley News Group reported.
The gunman also left at least two others injured, including a minor, and taken to the hospital by ambulance. Their current conditions are unknown.
An employee at nearby Desert Valley Hospital told the Daily Press, on the basis of anonymity, that juvenile was 8 years old and had been flown from the local facility to Loma Linda University Medical Center.     
The gunman remained on the loose as authorities investigated the incident.
Police in Victorville, located in San Bernardino County about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, responded to the mall around 7.51pm local time after receiving reports of shots fired.
Officials reportedly found the deceased victim's body near the Red Robin restaurant at the mall. His identity has not been released.
Shoppers were placed on a brief lockdown while police investigated.
‘They put up caution tape and told us that the area was on lockdown,’ witness Leanne Anderson, 25, told the Daily Press. ‘Later, we saw three ambulances speeding away from the mall.’
She added that a sheriff’s deputy also said they were looking for an ‘active shooter’ and that the surrounding businesses were also on lockdown.
Victorville Police Department, confirming the incident on Twitter, said no further details, including a suspect description, were available at this time. ",-2
184,"Police in Louisiana have arrested a New York man on suspicion of stabbing his father 46 times and leaving his corpse to rot on a sidewalk before fleeing.
Joseph Adams, 26, was detained in Gretna, near New Orleans, after the NYPD warrant for his arrest was enacted.
Members of NYPD traveled to Louisiana to bring him back to Brooklyn, where he was arraigned on Friday.
He is accused of stabbing to death his 49-year-old father, Christopher, and then wrapping his body in a comforter and leaving it on a sidewalk in the Cypress Hills area of Brooklyn.
Christopher Adams's body was found by a neighbor near Van Sinderen and Herkimer Streets, amid a pile of trash on October 16.
The neighbor reported a 'person-shaped bag', New York Daily News reported. 
The corpse was so badly decomposed that investigators were initially unable to determine the sex or manner of death. 
They quickly said his death was a homicide, identified him, and sought to arrest his son - who had already fled.
Joseph Adams is charged with murder, concealment of a human corpse, tampering with physical evidence and criminal possession of a weapon.
Adams did not respond to shouted questions as he walked out of the Brooklyn police station in handcuffs, ABC 7 reported. 
Sources told the channel that Adams has retained a lawyer and is not cooperating. ",-2
185,"Britney Spears slammed fellow pop diva Christina Aguilera for 'refusing to speak' about her conservatorship termination on Friday.
The 40-year-old Dirrty singer was asked if she and Spears were still in communication while walking the red carpet at the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards on November 18, before her team quickly interjected 'we're not doing that tonight.'
Re-posting the clip to social media, Britney wrote: 'refusing to speak when you know the truth is equivalent to a lie!!!' before praising others including Lady Gaga for 'speaking up' and publicly 'supporting' her.
'I love and adore everyone who supported me…but refusing to speak when you know the truth is equivalent to a lie!!!!,' Spears began. 
'13 years being in a corrupt abusive system yet why is it such a hard topic for people to talk about??? I’m the one who went through it!!!! All the supporters who spoke up and supported me thank you…yes I do matter!!!!!'
In the clip Christina was asked if she and Spears had 'had any communication' before a member of her team quickly thwarted any response, as he quipped: 'No we're not doing that tonight, I'm sorry, thank you though, bye!' 
Before dragging her off from the interview Christina added 'But I'm  happy for her.' 
 To draw a comparison, Spears then posted a clip of Lady Gaga being asked about her 13-year conservatorship while doing press for House Of Gucci, and praised her for 'taking the time' to speak on it. 
'Thank you @ladygaga for genuinely taking your time to say something so kind. You made me cry!!! I love you!!!'
In the interview the Pokerface singer had told reporters: 'The way she was treated in this business was really wrong. And the way that women are treated in the music industry is something that I wish would change.
'I think that she will forever be an inspiration to women,' Gaga said in conclusion. 
Both Christina and Lady Gaga had publicly spoken out about Spears' conservatorship on social media. 
In June the Genie In a Bottle singer had tweeted a photo of them from their Mickey Mouse club days and called her treatment under the conservatorship 'unacceptable.' 
'These past few days I've been thinking about Britney and everything she is going through. It is unacceptable that any woman, or human, wanting to be in control of their own destiny might to be allowed to life life as they wish.' 
After Spears' conservatorship was terminated by Judge Brenda Penny on Friday November 12, Gaga had shared a photo of them from the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. 
'I have loved @britneyspears her whole career. I looked up to her, admired her strength — she empower so many people and still does. I couldn't be more happy for you today. You never deserved what happened, Thank God 4 today. you're a superstar and a super-human being I LOVE YOU.' 
She joined other celebrities including Paris Hilton, Cher and Andy Cohen who had also publicly celebrated the Toxic singer's freedom. 
Following Britney's championing of Lady Gaga, the A Star Is Born actress posted an Instagram response. 
Spears and Aguilera's relationship spans back to their Mouseketeer days in the early nineties.
Both Christina and Britney's stars began to rise around the same time, with Spears becoming an overnight sensation after 1998's ...Baby One More Time, and Christina rocketing to fame after Genie In A Bottle in 1999. 
As the ladies became the two major female names in pop music, they were often pitted against each other despite originally starting off as friends. 
They were somewhat foils of each other however as Britney was known as music's 'good girl' while Christina had developed a naughtier image. 
The two however came together for one of the most memorable performances in television history as they performed with Madonna on the 2003 MTV VMAs. 
Though each locked lips with Madonna, Aguilera's kiss was overshadowed by Britney's as cameras cut to ex Justin Timberlake's face during the moment which caused Christina's smooch to get far less attention. 
The performance seemed to ignite a feud, with the Moulin Rouge singer making a snide remark about Spears while talking to Blender magazine which caused the Lucky singer to smear her name right back. 
'Every time I tried to start a conversation with her—well, let's just say she seemed nervous the whole time,' Christina had said. 'She seems to me like a lost little girl, someone who desperate needs guidance.' 
Retaliating the Circus singer then flipped it on her. 'A lost girl? I think it's probably the other way around.' 
She continued to recount a bizarre encounter where she accused the Ain't No Other Man singer of being 'fake' after she tried to 'put her tongue down my throat' in a nightclub after not having seen or spoken for years. 
'When someone has been rude to you so many times, it's like, ""You know what, Christina, I'm really not about the fake anymore,""' Spears told Blender. 
Insults continued to hurl a year later as Christina said Britney acted like 'trailer trash' and quipped that her engagement ring from Kevin Federline looked like it was from 'QVC.'  
She later recanted the statements while speaking to DailyMail.com in 2008 and tried to say that they weren't competitive despite the media portrayal. 
'When we both started releasing records, it was a funny time for me. It must have seemed as if we were competing with each other, but, in reality, Britney is someone that I used to hold hands with. I don't pass any judgment on what she does, I always wish her all the best.' 
A decade later Christina seemed to try and start anew as she posted a video collage of herself with powerful women for International Women's Day, which included Spears.   ",-2
186,"He's been living in Italy since October 2018 after being deported from the states.
And now Joe Giudice, 49, has lawyered up to fight for a chance to return to the United States.
'I would like to be able to see my children again in our home state, be a part of their lives, be physically present when they need me and watch them grow up,' he told Us Weekly on Friday.
Joe shares Gia, 20, Gabriella, 17, Milania, 15, and Audriana, 12, with ex-wife Teresa Giudice. 
The two each served time in prison after being found guilty of fraud. Following Joe's three-year stint behind bars he was exiled.  
Giudice is also vying to be back with his older family members, including his mom and grandmother.
'I yearn to hold my grandmother in my arms again before the time comes [in which] she is no longer on this Earth. [I want to] be with my mother [and] my family, to be in the place I have called home since I was a year old,' he told the media outlet.
The entrepreneur has enlisted immigration attorney Jessica M. Cadavid to help in his legal pursuit.
The former Bravo TV personality is feeling positive. 'I'm hopeful and pray that I can finally go home in the near future,' he remarked.
Cadavid plans to file a waiver of inadmissibility to try to workaround Joe's current status as a deportee. 
It likely wouldn't have been approved under the Trump administration, but the law professional thinks with Biden in office now there's a better chance.
'We are hopeful that this time around, we can take a look at his file with time that has passed from his deportation and the fact that he has a family here, he still has children here...he could ask the government for forgiveness and at least come back to be able to see his family,' Cadavid noted to the publication.
Giudice seems to spend the most time with his oldest daughter Gia, who often meets up with her dad in the Bahamas or Italy.
The two have a penchant for affectionately sharing daddy-daughter photos on their respective Instagram pages.
Earlier this week the father-of-four shared an outtake with his first born as they embraced each other, holding an adorable black puppy between them.
'My love,' he captioned the sweet outtake with a pink heart emoji. 
Earlier this month, the influencer took to the photo-sharing app to share snapshots with the patriarch.
In one photo they stood side by side with Joe looking dapper in a blue button up shirt, and the young beauty rocking a printed knee-length dress.
In another image Gia wore a green bikini and flip flops as her dad sported black shorts and sneakers as they smiled in front of turquoise water.
'Weekend recap. Love u dad,' she wrote under the post.",-2
187,"Disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her fraud trial on Friday after the judge denied her attorneys' request to toss all charges after the prosecution rested its case following 11 weeks of testimony by 29 witnesses.
Holmes, 37, addressed the allegation that she intentionally defrauded patients and investors by claiming the company's blood test technology could conduct a full range of tests when she supposedly knew it was inaccurate.
Holmes denied the allegation saying: 'We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all of the technologies in the laboratory.
'The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples….By 2009-2010 we had a breakthrough.' 
When asked about her public announcements about the number of tests Theranos could run and whether she was limiting her commentary to specific types of tests, she replied: 'No.' 
Before she took the stand, defense attorney Amy Mason Saharia motioned that all charges against Holmes be dismissed, alleging the case presented to the California jury 'is insufficient on every element on every count'.
U.S. District Judge Edward Davila said he would delay final judgment on the motion, the Marin Independent Journal reported. He did, however, dismiss one of the fraud counts against Holmes because of an error the prosecution made in its indictment.  
Holmes is accused of making false claims about Theranos, including that its technology could run a range of diagnostic tests more quickly and accurately than conventional laboratory testing with a drop of blood from a finger prick.During her testimony Friday, Holmes argued she believed in Theranos' technology.
Holmes told the jury about early efforts to raise capital, testifying that she had met with Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas, who ultimately invested in the company and became the chairman of its board.
'I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long term,' she said. 'He had a lot of questions.
Lucas 'began a very comprehensive diligence process,' including asking for Theranos' financial information, Holmes added.
Holmes also provided insight into her own background and the company's founding.
She described having been absorbed in lab research when she decided to leave Stanford University to start Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19, noting that her early team was focused on building components of the technology in question.
'We were prototyping,' she shared. 'I had the opportunity to hire some of the people I was working for and with at Stanford.' 
She also detailed how she financed the company when it was only a start-up.
'I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money they saved for me to go to college,' Holmes said. 'Then I went to go borrow money.'
She went on to raise more than $940million from private investors and eventually reached a valuation for Theranos of $9billion. 
Its fortunes waned after a series of articles published by the Wall Street Journal suggested the company's devices were flawed and inaccurate. 
Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy.
Over the course of her 11-week trial, jurors heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses for the prosecution, including patients and former Theranos investors whom prosecutors say Holmes deceived.  
The defense attempted to strike several of these testimonies, including one from a patient over the fact that her doctor didn't take the stand to explain her blood test results. 
After the prosecution rested its case, Holmes' attorneys immediately motioned to object to numerous parts of the government's case.
The defense pushed to exclude portions of a 'highly critical' report about the Theranos lab from the nation's lab regular, the Wall Street Journal reported.  
Her lawyers also requested to strike testimony from a patient who claimed her Theranos test results erroneously indicated she had HIV, alleging the patient was not qualified to interpret her blood test results.
The motion came after the prosecution challenged the relevance of presenting the jury with a list of Theranos patents - some of which list Holmes as an inventor.
'They're pieces of paper. They're not proof that the technology worked,' Assistant US Attorney Robert Leach said.  
Defense lawyer Katherine Trefz argued the patents would demonstrate Holmes' state of mind during the time of the alleged crimes and offer her understanding of the effectiveness of Theranos technology.  
'What's the state of mind? That she's smart?' Judge Edward Davila responded, noting that he wasn't blocking entering the patents altogether, but restricting some from later years. 
The defense also asked the court to strike all testimonies and exhibits from patients, doctors and customers.  
Holmes' attorneys also began presenting their case Friday by calling paralegal Trent Middleton to the stand to offer summaries of Theranos documents.
Middleton claimed he sorted through 'easily thousands of pages' of documents in an effort to present the jury with simple summaries and statistics of company data.
He reported that had 149 US patients issued to since 2007. He also showed a chart with customer receipts from 2011 to 2014 totaling $217.8million.
The defense is expected to reference Middleton's data with future witnesses.  
They have said they also plan to call Fabrizio Bonanni, who joined Theranos as a director in 2016. Bonanni will testify about the company's technology, they said in court. 
Defense attorney Lance Wade told jurors during opening arguments in September that Holmes was a hardworking young entrepreneur who had underestimated the obstacles Theranos faced before it failed.  ",-2
188,"The mother of a newborn found dead in a Connecticut dumpster in 1986 was charged with murder on Friday after detectives sifted through her trash last year and used advances in DNA testing to link her to the baby. 
Janita M. Phillips, now 62, turned herself in on Friday to police in Florida, where she had lived for more than 30 years since the child was found dead. Because all other applicable charges expired with the statute of limitations, she was charged with murder.
Phillips was 26 years old when she was deemed a person of interest in the infant's death. The boy's body was discovered by sanitation workers emptying a dumpster outside her apartment at 27 Havemeyer Place in Greenwich on May 16.  
Detectives noticed that towels in Phillips' apartment that she shared with her husband and then-two-year-old son matched those wrapped around the discarded infant. 
However, more substantial evidence was needed to charge the woman with a crime, and the case went cold when she and her husband, Jerry, moved to Lake Mary, Florida, soon after she was interviewed.
Advances in genetic testing allowed police to analyze the bloodied towel and other forensic evidence found with 'Baby John,' Deputy Chief Robert Berry said in a Friday press conference. 
Then, Greenwich Detective Christy Girardi and a Florida Sheriff's Deputy were sent to stake out the couple's trash bins in June of last year. 
With a discarded Q-Tip, detectives determined that Phillips was the mother of the long-deceased child. An emptied water bottle established Jerry's paternity.
Jerry appeared 'shocked' when detectives told him of the child's existence - and its subsequent killing - according to Greenwich Time. 
Phillips told police that Jerry had told her he didn't want any more children after her first birth, and she managed to hide her entire pregnancy from him and their families up until she gave birth in their apartment.
She 'never got big' during the pregnancy, she told investigators. Until the night she gave birth, she told investigators, she repeatedly thought to herself, 'this can’t be happening.' 
'I just remember I didn’t plan for this,' Phillips told police - more than 35 years after she gave birth to the child - according to the affidavit.
She barely handled or looked at the baby in the brief moments after his birth, she said, because that would make the situation 'real.'
A medical examiner determined shortly after the boy's body was found that he had been strangled to death. 
'I didn't want to crash [my husband's] dreams and fall down the rabbit hole of having a bunch of kids and stuck with bills and not being able to care for them or get to achieve his dreams,' Phillips, who admitted to the murder, told detectives.
Greenwich Time reported that Janita Phillips was working at Saks Fifth Avenue on Greenwich Avenue at the time, while her husband was working as a fashion designer, suit-maker and custom tailor. 
Since 1986, Phillips had maintained a clean criminal record and a 'stellar life' with 30 years in the insurance industry, her defense attorney Lindy Urso said.
Since her arrest, however, she has been in a 'tenuous spot psychologically.'
'Any way you cut this pie, it’s a very, very tragic situation,' he said. 'She’s had to live with this grief for 35 years, and now it’s obviously dredged up again.'
Initially, Phillips was held on a $50,000 bail bond, but she was released on the promise that she would check in with the Bail Commissioner's Office weekly after her arraignment hearing Friday in Stamford's state Superior Court. 
States Attorney Paul Ferencek supports the decision to release Phillips, saying the state doesn't view her as a flight risk. He said on Friday that, since the alleged homicide, she has lived a 'blameless life' without a criminal record.         
'Today we begin to get closure on the death investigation of an infant child, many years ago,' Greenwich Police Chief James Heavey said during Friday’s press conference.  
'While today’s arrest will not bring back that child, it does bring recognition that his precious life had meaning, and that he will not be forgotten.'
'The investigation of his tragic death has taken many long years, but he has always been remembered and we hope this conclusion will bring him peace and recognition.'",-2
189,"Chris Daughtry's wife Deanna denounced reports that her late daughter Hannah Price's tragic death was being investigated as a homicide.
The 48-year-old grieving mother penned a lengthy Instagram statement on Friday where she tried to clear up any assumptions about the 25-year-old's cause of death which echoed statements given by district attorneys in Tennessee.
'The news floating around that we said our daughters death is being investigated as a homicide is false!,' she wrote in excerpt alongside a photo of her late daughter as a child.
Hannah was found dead at her home in Fentress County, Tennessee on November 12, and the manner of death continues to be under investigation, despite early reports indicating that detectives told family members it was homicide.  
'The news floating around that we said our daughters death is being investigated as a homicide is false! We were not told that and never said that to anyone!,' Deanna began. 
'The day Hannah was found I shared some concerns I had with some ppl I know and said we won’t know anything for sure till after they complete the investigation. Someone took that and went running with it or they talked to some else who then made assumptions and went running to the press with it. 
'None of us can go jumping to conclusions. Having questions & concerns is one thing but harassing someone and calling them a murderer before all the facts are in is wrong on every level regardless of their history,' she continued to say but did not specify outright who she was referring to. 
'I lost my child and I’m having to now also deal with rumors and assumptions about her. The people who loved her are in pain and we are mourning they are not talking to the press, they are not spreading rumors and they sure as hell are not making this about themselves. So everyone please just stop! 
'Let the investigating officers do their jobs and please remember snippets of someone’s life does not define who they really are as a person. Hannah was on this earth with us for 25 years there is so much more to her story then what you are reading. 
'I loved my daughter so much & I am experiencing the deepest emotional pain I have ever felt! Please stop making it worse for those of us who love her by spreading rumors & saying disgusting things about our family. We are real people! Just because my husband has a public job does not mean this is OK to do,' she pleaded. 
'To the beautiful humans who are sending us their prayers, love, and kindness during this time, we thank you. We are not able to reach out to you all individually as I’m sure you understand but please know we are thankful for people like you,' Deanna said in conclusion. 
In line with Deanna's statements, prosecutors in Tennessee said this week that it would be 'premature' to rule the death of Chris Daughtry’s step daughter as a homicide, which refuted reports indicating that detectives told family members it was. 
Jared Effler, the district attorney of Tennessee’s 8th Judicial District, gave a statement to DailyMail.com on Monday indicating that no arrests have been made in connection with the death of 25-year-old Hannah Price.
Price’s boyfriend, Bobby Jolly, 25, was reportedly booked into Fentress County Jail on Friday - the same day her body was found in her home in Nashville, Tennessee. Authorities have not said whether Jolly is a person of interest, or publicly stated why Jolly was arrested. 
'This is a death investigation and any attempt to classify it as a homicide investigation at this time is premature and irresponsible,' the DA said on Monday. 'Further, no one has been arrested pertaining to the death of Ms. Price.' 
A medical examiner at the Regional Forensic Center in Knoxville has yet to reveal the cause or manner of her death, and the family is still awaiting for autopsy results. 
TMZ had reported over the weekend that detectives informed Price’s family that the probe into her death was a homicide investigation, which seemed to prompt Deanna's lengthy statement. 
Hannah's stepfather Chris (who first found fame on American Idol)  posted an emotional statement on his Instagram page following the news of her death which revealed he was struggling.  
'I am still processing the last 24 hours. I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken. I just recently lost my mother to cancer but I was blessed with the chance to say goodbye and I was processing it privately. 
'We never got to say goodbye to our precious Hannah and it's another huge hit to our family. Thank you all for your kind words and condolences. They are truly felt and appreciated. I am now taking time be present with my family as we attempt to heal from this devastating loss.'
 The singer-songwriter was in the middle of his Dearly Beloved Tour at the time of Hannah's death, and has now postponed several of his upcoming tour dates. 
Chris and Deanna have been married for over two decades. The couple share 10-year-old twins Adalynn and Noah and 23-year-old Griffin, with Hannah being from Deanna's previous relationship. ",-2
190,"A Liberian-owned ship called the Beijing is believed to be responsible for the massive oil spill that tarnished Southern California beaches last month after the vessel's anchor dragged across the seabed and cracked a crucial pipeline 
The U.S. Coast Guard together with the National Transportation Safety Board Friday identified the cargo ship Costco Beijing as the vessel that was likely involved in the incident. 
Although the pipe was hit by the anchor in January, it didn't begin to leak oil until October, investigators said.
The owners of Beijing, Capetanissa Maritime Corp. of Liberia, and operator, V.Ships Greece Ltd. were both named as 'parties in interest,' and investigators boarded the vessel at the Port of Long Beach on Thursday.
The finding means investigators will now be able to be examine the vessel more closely as the probe into the spill moves forward. 
Federal investigators managed to determine that the ship had been involved in the anchor dragging incident, which happened 'in close proximity' to an underwater pipeline.
The pipeline was later found to be the source of the leak, causing thousands of gallons of oil to spew into the ocean - which shut beaches and marinas in Orange County. 
The rupture was to a pipeline owned by Amplify Energy in federal waters at the Elly oil-rig platform some 4½ miles offshore.
The pipeline runs for 18 miles from Amplify's offshore drilling platforms to a Long Beach pump station. 
It was confirmed that Amplify's pipeline was damaged and moved for more than 100 feet along the ocean floor, suggesting the ship's anchor may have caused the damage.  
It was initially thought around 144,000 gallons of oil could have leaked from the pipeline but officials determined the amount was far lower - at around 25,000, although there is no firm figure.
The shorelines in Huntington Beach, which is known as 'Surf City USA,' and neighboring Newport Beach were shut down for a short time. 
Coastal shops ended up taking a hit and environmental advocates have voiced concerns about the long-term impact of the spill on sensitive wetland areas and wildlife.
More than four dozen animals, mostly birds and fish, were found dead in the week after the spill, though not all were visibly oiled.
It’s not known why the leak occurred eight months later rather than at the time of the anchor collision. Authorities also are looking into whether other anchors hit and weakened the pipeline or if a preexisting condition with the line was to blame. ",-2
191,"The mother of one of four black teenage girls who was captured on video brutally assaulting a group of Asian students on a Philadelphia train turned her into police as all four were slapped with a slew of charges, including ethnic intimidation. 
Shocking video captured the group of black teenage girls brutally throwing punches and screaming profanities at a group of Asian students this week. 
The unidentified girls, who were between the ages of 13 and 16, were charged with aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation, criminal conspiracy, simple assault, disorderly conduct, and recklessly endangering another person, according to the district attorney's office. 
Thomas Nestel, police chief for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), said the attack was unprovoked and had been based on the group's ethnicity, noting that 'ethnic slurs were used by the attackers.'  
Nestel revealed how the mother of one of the teen suspects recognized her own daughter from the video and went straight to the cops.     
Her daughter and her pals turned their fury on a group of four students, which  included three boys and a girl, who were traveling on the train on Wednesday from North Philadelphia.  
Police said 'ethnic slurs were repeated and directed at them and mocking them for their heritage... it was clear they were picked on because they were Asian,' Nestel said.    
One of the suspects was also charged with robbery for the attempted theft of a victim's air pods, the prosecutor said. 
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the city would not tolerate such acts of hate and that he was appalled after learning about the incident.
'Those involved in the assault have been identified and will be held accountable. I want our residents to know that we will not tolerate any acts of hate,' Kenney tweeted.
It is unclear what sparked the feud, but video footage shows a girl in an all-pink outfit and a black ski mask screaming profanities at around 3.30pm on Wednesday. 
The video opens with the girl in pink screaming at a group of Asian boys while another in a black quarter-zip jacket punches one who is wearing a red jacket. 
The girl in pink appears to say, 'You want to doubt my people,' before firing off  a string of profanities. 
'You want to come on, b***ch? You want to try me, b***ch, f**king try me, I'll f**king beat ya,' she continued screaming as she stood over the the group of sitting boys. 
She also yelled at a female Asian student standing near the boys.  
Another girl, dressed in a black sweater that reads 'confidence collection thurl' across the chest,  pointed her finger and screamed at the boys: 'Don't try that s**t again. Don't try that s**t again.' 
It is unclear what the other students did to anger the girls.
An older girl, dressed in black with a black bandana over her hair, stepped in and pointed at the boy sitting close to the window next to the one in red and said: 'It was really him, it was really him.'  
She then proceeded to turn around and slap the mask off the Asian girl, screaming at her: 'Get the f**k out of here, And bitch, stop f**king [indiscernible].' 
The Asian girl appears to be upset, but doesn't say anything as she adjusts her mask back over her nose.  
The girl in pink then corners her, backing her up until her back's against the door, yelling: 'What? What? What?' as she pushes the Asian girl. 
She appears to slam the palm of her hand into the girl's head several times before the girl falls to the ground. 
She bends down and continues to hit her before more girls come over and begin to stomp on her back as she screams. 
The girl in pink takes off one of her slipper-like shoes and slams it into the girl's head while calling her a b***ch. 
Someone in the background can be heard screaming 'yo, yo, yo.' 
The video ends as the girl in pink straightens up to look at the male yelling at them to stop.  
A SEPTA spokesperson called the incident 'violent and disturbing,' but reported no major injuries.  
The Philadelphia School Administration said they 'did have additional Student Support staff on hand at Central High School to support any students who be experiencing anxiety over what happened.'
A Philadelphia City Councilman David Oh is calling on SEPTA and the Philadelphia School District to increase safety measures. 
'There has to be a response by the police, by SEPTA school safety officers, formerly known as school police, and by SEPTA itself. It has a police force and we need to see them,' he said.  
Last month, a woman was attacked by an illegal immigrant and raped on a SEPTA train, while other passengers didn't intervene. 
Fiston Ngoy, a 35-year-old from the Congo who has been living illegally in the U.S. since 2015, was arrested and charged in the rape.
He was seen on surveillance camera footage onboard a SEPTA train near the suburb of Upper Darby.
Police say that as many as 10 bystanders were on the train did nothing but did not help as Ngoy sexually assaulted the stranger shortly after 9.15pm.
The attack continued until 9.52pm, when an off-duty transit worker eventually called 911.
Hate crimes continue to rise around the nation, with a more than 300 percent increase across the US, the New York Daily News reported.  ",-2
192,"Three Colorado teenagers were wounded during a shootout in an Aurora high school parking lot Friday less than a week after six teens were hit by bullets in a drive-by at a different school - in the city that gained infamy eight years ago when a dozen people were killed at a movie theater during a midnight screening of Batman.
Two students from Hinkley High and one from the nearby APS Avenues High School were rushed to the hospital, with one of the teens believed to be the suspect that opened fire on the other two before being shot. 
'We have kids shooting each other with no concern for life whatsoever,' Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said. 
Wilson said multiple people were firing shots during the fight before a school security officer 'heroically' came out to return fire and end the gun battle.  
Wilson would not say if the security officer wounded any of the students, but he applied a tourniquet to one of the victims as emergency responders arrived at the scene. 
The school was placed on lockdown before students were released to their homes.
None of the shooting victims were identified. 
Police have taken possession of a white pickup truck believed to be involved in the incident. 
The shootings come less than a week after six teenagers were injured in a drive-by shooting on Monday near Aurora Central High School.
'This is the second shooting in Aurora this week that has impacted students' ability to feel safe at school,' Aurora's District Attorney John Keller said in a statement. 
'No Child or teenager should be fearful just going to class - a normal activity we can all relate to. Our community rightly is demanding an end to this violence, and we will stand with them in using every tool we have to prosecute aggressively anyone connected to these attacks on students.'  
Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly called the two recent shootings 'heartbreaking.' 
'I cannot begin to imagine the pain and anguish experienced by the victims and their families. We must commit our time and resources to the city’s Youth Violence Prevention Program and our public safety partners to identify ways for increased involvement and better solutions,' Twombly said in a statement.  
Monday's victims, aged 14 to 18, were shot by 'multiple gunmen' at Nome Park, which is adjacent to the Aurora Central High School, police said.
‘I need us all to be outraged by what happened here today,’ Wilson told reporters at a news conference after the shootings. 
Investigators recovered various calibers of bullets from the scene, leading them to believe multiple gunmen opened fire, although no arrests had been made yet.
Witnesses recalled hearing upward of 50 gunshots as students fled the park at around 12:45 p.m. Monday, Fox 31 reported. 
School resource officers applied a tourniquet to two injured teenagers, one of whom was taken to a hospital for emergency surgery, Wilson said, adding that none of the victims suffered life-threatening injures. 
The victims were a 14-year-old boy, a 15-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl, a 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old boy, police said. None of them were identified. 
A nurse who lives in the area heard the barrage of gunfire and rushed to the victims' aid. 
'One was shot in the arm. Her arm was injured badly. Another boy was shot in the back and on his leg,' she told KDVR
'So, we did put a tourniquet on his leg. Applied pressure on his back, tourniquet on the girl’s arm. Another girl had multiple injuries on her back.'   
Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman issued a statement following Monday's shooting.
'My prayers are with the injured and their families,' he tweeted.
‘As the facts surrounding this incident become known, I look forward to hearing from our Chief of Police and from our District Attorney about what actions will be taken to apprehend and prosecute, to the fullest extent of the law, those responsible for this incident.'
Aurora, a city of approximately 336,000 located about 30 miles east of Denver, was the site of the second deadliest shooting in Colorado history after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. 
On July 20, 2012, James Holmes, dressed in tactical gear, barged into a midnight screening of Dark Knight Rises at Century 16 movie theater and opened fire on the audience, killing 12 and injuring 70 others.  
Holmes was later convicted of multiple counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to 12 life sentences.  ",-2
193,"Warring families, witchcraft, dragons, blood, gore — and gratuitous nudity. Sound familiar?
Based on a series of novels by American author Robert Jordan, new fantasy series The Wheel Of Time on Amazon is hoping to cash in on the massive success of Game Of Thrones.
The first three episodes of the show, starring British actress Rosamund Pike, premiered yesterday.
Here, ALISON BOSHOFF reveals how the show was brought to the screen and GoT superfan HANNAH BETTS gives her verdict.
Frankly, I bow to no one in my love for — yet acknowledgment of the ridiculousness of — Game Of Thrones.
For all its game-changing brilliance in the matter of script, scope and performance, there were also some utterly lamentable moments (the Ed Sheeran cameo, anyone?)
But, mostly, it was a wild and brilliant ride and I would not have spent the years between 2011 to 2019 any other way.
Will Amazon’s Wheel Of Time live up to this august and money-spinning predecessor?
For a start, I must stop referring to it as Wheel Of Fortune, which is a cheesy game show rather than some cheesy dragon-and-orc affair.
We had been promised the greatest fantasy adventure of all time. On the strength of episode one, the jury’s still out, albeit there is a vast difference between watching bleary-eyed at 8am (when the series hit the UK) than 8pm glassy-eyed with wine.
Matters kick off with Rosamund Pike, steelily beautiful as sorceress Moiraine Damodred, going all Greta Thunberg as she dresses for a quest. ‘The world is broken,’ she intones.
‘Many, many years ago men who were born with great power believed they could cage darkness itself. The arrogance! When they failed, the seas boiled, mountains were swallowed up, cities burned, and the women of the Aes Sedai were left to pick up the pieces.’
Lady, we get it, this is all shades Cop26.
Much falls on Pike’s artfully padded shoulders in the subsequent 53 minutes. She bears the burden gracefully, if mysteriously, as glacially attractive fortysomething women tend to do in such dramas.
Her look is brown dye job Gone Girl, with no-make-up make-up, what is clearly an excellent horseback skincare regime and a great line in Matrix-style magic. And top marks on the sexy sidekick (dashing Daniel Henney) with whom she shares not only a hot tub, but the capacity for psychic communication.
Witchy Moiraine heads off to Hicksville, aka Two Rivers, to search for the Dragon Reborn, a messiah figure who will save humanity from The Dark One and the Trollocs (flesh-eating, horned man/beast hybrids).
There she unearths five proteges, older than we discover in the book, and thus up for flirting. We have The Heroically Cheekboney Youth; The Strong Dim One who conveniently kills his wife; The Sly Chancer with a Heart of Gold; The Good Girl with Powers; and The Other Feisty Female.
When it comes to the sex it’s implied but not seen. On the Thrones tick list, The Wheel Of Time boasts plaits, man buns, bad bleach jobs, craggy landscapes, medieval yokels, career-minded females, scary monsters, swords of significance, flaky mysticism, immortal love interests, chosen ones, impending evil and guts and gore aplenty.
Dialogue is of the ‘old blood runs deep in those mountains’ sort, while the silly-name quotient runs high. At £8 million an episode, it looks more expensive than early episodes of Game Of Thrones.
Most obviously, the requisite sass and menace that made GoT so compelling was not yet in evidence for Wheel to prove a winning successor. When Game Of Thrones was good, it was very good, crackling with wit, intellect and the screen’s most quotable dialogue.
Opener this may have been, but, in this, WoT episode one fell flat. A woke wonder, or a load of old Trollocs? Only (the wheel of) time will tell.
How they created The Wheel of Time 
By Hannah Betts
BATTLE OF THE BUDGETS
The rising popularity of streaming services means that TV no longer plays second fiddle to cinema. As a result, big production shows now have bank-breaking budgets.
The final series of Game Of Thrones cost £11 million per episode and both Star Wars spin off The Mandalorian and futuristic Western Westworld were not far behind.
The Wheel Of Time has eight episodes per series and a budget said to be between £55 million and £75 million, which works out at between £6.9 million and £9.4 million per episode, making it one of the costliest TV shows ever made.
Around 600 cast and crew worked on the production, including a 217-strong visual effects team.
Filmed mainly in and around Prague, Amazon received £11.1 million funding from the national government which represented 20 per cent of the costs spent in the Czech Republic, which means that they spent £55 million there.
FANTASY FEVER
It is no coincidence that Amazon is pinning its hope on a show in the same vein as Game Of Thrones: fantasy adventures are still considered TV gold.
As one TV critic observed: ‘Game Of Thrones didn’t just open the door to more fantasy commissions, it opened the floodgates. It told TV executives not just to pursue fantasy books or comics, but to gobble them up.’
After Game Of Thrones came The Witcher, about a mutated monster hunter, His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman and Good Omens, a collaboration between authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman about the birth of satan’s son.
Following The Wheel Of Time are those prequels to The Hobbit/Lord Of The Rings and Game Of Thrones, both due next autumn.
MYSTICAL
The Oscar- nominated actress Rosamund Pike is the most famous face in the adaptation.
She plays Moiraine Damodred, a member of the all-female Aes Sedai organisation, who have the One Power, a kind of magic.
Moiraine has dedicated her life to finding the Dragon Reborn, a messiah figure who will save all humanity.
The story opens with her arriving in the town of Two Rivers.
Pike, 42, said: ‘I needed to feel that you would believe Moiraine had this power if there were no visual effects — the most important thing for me was that I felt connected to something greater than myself.
‘I felt like a badass. I said to [showrunner Rafe Judkins] when I first saw it, “I need this video of me shooting fireballs to show to my sons again, and again.”
Talking about the CGI effects, she joked: ‘It was great. I did a full-body scan on day one — and then I never had to show up!’
THE RISING STARS
Pike is joined by a fresh young cast including Australian actress Madeleine Madden (who plays Egwene al’Vere) from Picnic At Hanging Rock and Dutch newcomer Josha Stradowski as central character, shepherd Rand al’Thor.
New Zealand actress Zoe Robins plays Nynaeve, the ‘Wisdom’ of the village.
All started pre-production in August 2019 with six weeks of dialect and stunt training, including horse-riding lessons.
Zoe said: ‘I’ve never been involved in something of this scale. To be involved at the establishing moments too, to be a part of collaborating on costuming, hair and make-up, was something that I had never experienced before.
‘The knowledge that this is a beloved fantasy book series was something that was not lost on us either. There are people who have grown up with the characters in these books, and it means a lot to a lot of people.’
She added that two pandemic-prompted shutdowns made the cast closer.
‘We were able to bond quicker in a way than I think we would have, because we really had to rely on each other as a second family.’
NEW TWIST ON NUDITY
Game Of Thrones was notorious for repeated female nudity, with complaints that much of it appeared gratuitous. By contrast, The Wheel Of Time will feature more naked men than women.
Rosamund Pike said: ‘You see many more naked men than you see naked women, which is quite pleasing, since women have been asked to expose themselves forever and a day. We’ve got all the boys frantically dieting and working out hard for their naked scenes and all of the women going out for lovely dinners.’
Rafe Judkins, who helped adapt the book to the screen, says that the show is suitable to watch with teenagers — and that there is sex and some nudity, but nothing like the frankness of Game Of Thrones.
In the first episode there is implied sex and some male nudity. He said: ‘There’s way more nudity in The Witcher or Game Of Thrones but that’s not really true to The Wheel of Time, and we don’t need it to tell the stories that we have with the characters that we have. It’s an adult world. So, you still see stuff sometimes, but we’re never really super-graphic.’
WAR-HERO WRITER
The author of The Wheel Of Time, Robert Jordan, died aged just 58 in 2007, his books having sold more than 90 million copies in 24 languages.
He served as an army helicopter gunner for two tours in the Vietnam War, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bronze Star.
After Vietnam, he worked as a nuclear engineer for the U.S. navy.
However, he fell at a shipyard, which led to a blood clot that almost killed him and meant he needed a cane to walk.
This injury was the trigger for a new career as a writer. He wrote a historical trilogy under the pseudonym Reagan O’Neal, then a Western as Jackson O’Reilly. This was followed by novels based on the Conan The Barbarian franchise.
Then in 1990 he created The Eye Of The World, his first in The Wheel Of Time series.
The hero, Rand al’Thor, is just a boy when he and his friends start to try and save the world from the Dark One in what becomes an epic saga.
After falling ill in 2005 with a rare blood disease, he announced he was working on another novel — and left extensive notes which writer Brandon Sanderson used to finish the books after his death.
Rosamund Pike said: ‘When I found out that Robert Jordan had been a helicopter gunner in Vietnam, I thought, oh, that’s where this big fantasy world originates. That’s why he’s interested in men who had power and abused it and broke the world.’
CZECH MATES
THE Wheel Of Time makers created their own studio and leased a gigantic 32,000 sq m production hall on the outskirts of Prague in the Czech Republic.
Jordan Studios includes five sound stages, a stunt gym, a writers’ room and a backlot where various permanent outdoor sets were built.
Pike said: ‘There’s not much I can tell you about trekking across its gigantic set, a former truck factory, because I signed a scary-looking NDA.’
Initially, producers looked at Los Angeles, London, and Budapest but realised that they would need to buy industrial buildings in Prague to realise their ambitious vision.
It is said that the whole town of Two Rivers was built — and then burned down as part of the storyline.",-2
194,"NOW Cop26 has drawn to a close, you may be left feeling a little befuddled about how best to do your bit for the planet.
Does it make sense to stop eating imported fruit if you plan to fly to the sun for some much-needed family time next year?
Is a shower more eco-friendly than a soak in the tub?
To answer such questions — and help us better understand the implications of our consumer choices — PROFESSOR MIKE BERNERS-LEE, professor of sustainability at Lancaster University, has calculated the carbon footprint of absolutely everything . . . with some surprising conclusions.
Like most people I don’t particularly enjoy instructions on how to live.
I may have spent 15 years researching the impact of the carbon emissions that are slowly heating our planet.
But I’ve also had plenty of practice in not being quite as good as I’d like to be.
We all want to live our lives responsibly but we have to live. That’s not to say we don’t need to change our habits. We do. We are in a climate emergency. But a sense of scale is required.
A friend once asked how he should best dry his hands to reduce his carbon footprint — with a paper towel or electric drier? This same person flies across the Atlantic dozens of times a year.
The flying is hugely more significant than the hand-drying, so my friend was just distracting himself from the real issue.
The reason I decided to work out the carbon footprint of everything I could think of was to help you get a feel for roughly how much carbon is at stake when you make simple day-to-day choices.
Everything we do has some impact — where we travel to and how, whether we buy an apple in season or asparagus in winter, whether we have a quick shower or luxuriate in the bath.
What is a carbon footprint? It’s a measure of the impact of our activities on the amount of greenhouse gases being produced and released into the atmosphere.
All we consume and do and think about, both at home and work, has a carbon impact — that is, a climate change impact.
But you might be very surprised by some of the things that have a hefty carbon load and some that don’t.
I use a measure called ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ to calculate the volume of harmful gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, refrigerant and other gases) generated in the making and consumption of any product or service.
Take a tomato: any calculation needs to take into account how it was grown (naturally or in a heated greenhouse), the type of fertiliser used (some require a complex manufacturing process, others emit greenhouse gases), and how it was packaged and transported (by road, ship or air, the latter being a carbon disaster).
As a consumer, you need to consider that 1kg of locally grown tomatoes has a carbon footprint of 400g CO2e compared to an astounding 50kg CO2e produced by 1kg of organic, ‘on the vine’ UK cherry tomatoes grown out of season in March.
Choose those tomatoes and they can be the highest-carbon food of all, even though grown here.
Bananas, on the other hand, may travel far before they land in our fruit bowls, but as they tend to be shipped rather than airfreighted and require less packaging because they are protected by their skins, they are a low-carbon — and extremely nutritious — food.
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS BAD FOR PLANET
Gold and diamonds are precious precisely because it takes effort, industry and resources to extract them, and this takes their carbon footprint sky high, particularly for jewellery which comes from far afield (£500 worth of gold and diamonds from Africa has a carbon footprint of 710kg CO2e).
That’s aside from the bad working conditions for some miners. Far better to wear jewellery passed down through the family, re-fashioned from existing gems or made from natural materials like shells.
GROW YOUR OWN BOUQUETS
Out-of-season cut flowers are bad news for climate change, because they either have to be put on a plane to get here or grown with artificial heat.
A single red rose may be romantic, but when grown in a Netherlands hothouse or outdoors in Kenya and airfreighted to Europe, it will set you back 2.4kg of CO2e compared to zero carbon for a rose grown in your own garden.
A bouquet a week of imported flowers could add 1.5 tonnes of CO2e a year per person.
Grow your own flowers or look for bouquets of local-grown, seasonal blooms (1.7kg CO2e for 15 UK outdoor-grown stems).
An alternative is indoor plants, which are far less carbon-intensive.
DON'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT A DISHWASHER
A high-efficiency dishwasher always wins on carbon footprint over washing the dishes in hot water as long as you run a full load (between 470g to 600g of CO2e per full load) and particularly if you set it to run at night when electricity demand is low and the grid becomes more efficient.
Rinsing plates before stacking the machine is the worst option and ranks alongside ironing your spouse’s socks. If this is your routine, liberate yourself, sharpish.
ORDER A COFFEE WITHOUT MILK
The quickest way to slash the carbon footprint of your morning coffee (or tea) is to drink it black (49g of CO2e per cup for instant coffee or 87g a cup for a black filter or Americano compared with 235g CO2e for a large cappuccino).
Cow’s milk has such a high emissions toll that even the splash in tea accounts for three quarters of a cuppa’s carbon footprint. For a large latte (552g of CO2e) you could have nine Americanos or 25 cups of black tea.
If you buy takeaways, add 110g of CO2e for the disposable cup. At home, use one sturdy mug and only wash it at the end of the day.
JUST HOW BAD ARE IMPORTED BANANAS?
The distances bananas travel to reach us are vast.
But at just 110g of CO2e each, bananas are actually a great food for anyone who cares about their carbon footprint.
Grown in natural sunlight with no hothousing required, they keep well.
So although they are often grown thousands of miles from the end consumer, they are transported by boat (about one per cent of the carbon footprint of airfreight) and they require hardly any packaging as they have skins.
The only really bad bananas are those you allow to rot in your fruit bowl.
These join the scandalous 22 per cent of food binned by consumers in the UK.
Use overripe bananas in baking or enjoy with lashings of custard.
GO FOR THE UGLIEST APPLE IN THE SHOP
Buy the most misshapen apples. It encourages the supply chain not to chuck less-than-perfect-looking fruits away.
Apples are low-carbon but local and seasonal is best (32g of CO2e per kg). This changes when out of season.
UK apples bought in early summer will be last year’s fruit, which will have been kept refrigerated, so requiring electricity. This makes imported apples (80g of CO2e per kg) a better option.
NO WINTER ASPARAGUS
Perhaps the single most carbon-intensive winter vegetable is fresh asparagus flown in from Peru (4.7kg of CO2e per pack.)
That’s because a mile by air typically has about 100 times the carbon impact of a mile by sea. The same applies to airfreighted baby corn, baby carrots, mangetout, green beans, fine beans, okra, shelled peas, lettuces, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.
Enjoy lashings of UK asparagus in summer (270g of CO2e per pack) then wait a year to eat it again.
THE SCOOP ON THE MOST ECO ICE CREAM
A soft scoop from a van comes with a hefty carbon price tag of 500g of CO2e per cone as the vanilla ice cream’s dairy-based and kept cold in a less efficient mobile refrigeration unit, often belching out diesel fumes.
A chocolate flake makes the footprint of an ice cream higher again, though perhaps we can agree this is a necessary evil.
Opt for a plant-based ice cream for your cone, instead. Better still, buy a choc ice (140g of CO2e) or an ice lolly (70g of CO2e) from a shop, which has a lower figure as its refrigeration will be more efficient.
CROCS ARE TOPS
Shoes vary a lot in their carbon footprint, depending on what they’re made of and how long they last.
Running shoes made in China might come in at 8kg of CO2e a pair, but specialist leather is more (15kg of CO2e).
At the lowest end of the scale are a pair of Crocs, made with just 250g of expanded EVA (foam rubber).
They are sold unpackaged so the carbon toll is just over 1kg CO2e per pair.
ARE REUSABLE NAPPIES THAT SAINTLY?
A cloth nappy may seem better than a disposable but if washed at 90 degrees and tumble-dried to soften, it’ll carry a higher carbon footprint (165g of CO2e per nappy) than a disposable (130g per nappy).
The lowest carbon option is reusable nappies washed at 60 degrees, line dried, and passed on to a second child (60g CO2e per nappy).
Up to 20 per cent of the carbon footprint of a disposable nappy arises from the methane it emits as it rots down in landfill.
Biodegradable disposable nappies break down more rapidly in landfill so give off more of the gas.
WINE BOXES OVER BOTTLES
The bottle usually has a bigger footprint than the wine. Shipping is only a small part, so it doesn’t matter much where your wine comes from.
Far more important are the road miles — in your country and the country of origin.
For this reason, locally produced wine could cut the footprint by 20 per cent (1.3kg CO2e a bottle from Britain or France) and, oddly, I estimate Australian wine shipped to the UK (in huge sealed tanks) probably has a slightly lower footprint (at 1.4kg) than Sicilian transported in bottles by road (1.65kg).
By buying wine boxes or cartons you can reduce the footprint by a factor of about five.
EAT FROZEN BERRIES WHEN IT’S COLD
Fresh strawberries flown in from South Africa in winter or those grown in a hothouse come with an eye-wateringly high carbon cost of 3.65kg CO2e for a 250g punnet.
Far better to eat UK strawberries in summer. Or opt for frozen British berries (770g CO2e for 250g) which are super-nutritious and easier than fresh fruit to eat without wastage, as you can take just what is needed from the freezer.
NEVER, EVER FLY BUSINESS CLASS
Flying, particularly long haul, is bad for the planet. Emissions from airborne planes have a greater impact on greenhouse gases than those burning the same amount of fuel on the ground. A business class seat, as it takes up more room, has a greater percentage of the flight’s total carbon footprint. A single flight is equivalent to using 340,000 plastic bags.
If you do fly, choose economy. Go abroad less often, stay away for longer and only fly to do something you can’t do here in the UK.
RATION BATHS AND TIME YOUR SHOWERS
abandon a daily bath, folks — just have one a week. A quick dip can be anything from 500g to 1.5kg of CO2e depending on your heating system.
Far better to have a quick, daily shower. Five minutes is 160g to 250g of CO2e (depending on your hot water system). You could treat yourself to 15 minutes under a power shower for the 1kg of CO2e you generate running a hot bath.
ONE TAP THAT YOU SHOULD TURN ON
At 400g of CO2e per litre, bottled water is 1,000 times more carbon intense than tap water, so it really pays to ditch the plastic bottles.
The carbon emissions come mainly from packaging and transport, but add 83g CO2e per litre for the plastic, and 20g CO2e to melt the plastic pellets and mould them into bottles.
Transport is also significant because water is so heavy.
SWAP YOUR CAR FOR THE TRAIN 
Trains are generally a lot greener than cars, though a good petrol car can beat a train’s carbon footprint if the car is full of people. Even two people travelling together are better off driving an efficient car than travelling first class by train.
The carbon cost of a train trip depends on how fast it goes (air resistance increases with speed), how many stops there are (each stop wastes energy) and type of fuel used (electricity beats diesel).
Travelling by an Underground train is lower-carbon per passenger mile than an intercity train (68g of CO2e) — mainly because people are packed in so tightly.
YOU MUST EAT YOUR (SOURDOUGH) CRUSTS
Homemade sourdough or locally baked artisan loaf has a smaller carbon footprint than mass-produced sliced bread (630g of CO2e per loaf compared to 1kg of CO2e for mass-produced).
More than 60 per cent of the emissions of all bread production comes from the wheat cultivation (and most of that is the fertilizer used). A third comes from the milling and baking.
Transport is a tiny fraction if bought locally. Buy only what you need and always eat the crusts! Food waste thrown into landfill is very bad news.
Rice, unlike bread, is a surprisingly high-carbon staple (at 4kg to 7.1kg of CO2e per kg depending on planting practices).
This is due to the methane that bubbles out of the flooded paddy fields and the carbon-excessive nitrogen fertilisers that are often applied. This means a kilo of rice can cause more emissions than burning a litre of diesel.

195,"A picture showing a grinning Prince Andrew was on display at Jeffery Epstein's notorious 'Pleasure Palace' where he was accused of molesting teenage girls.
The image, which sat next to a framed photograph of billionaire paedophile Epstein at his former Florida retreat in Palm Beach, shows a smiling Andrew apparently in military uniform in his younger years.
The Duke of York, 61, had previously denied making frequent visits to Epstein's Florida home, despite the former housekeeper Juan Alessi claiming Andrew spent 'weeks at a time' at the property when he was working there.
Sources warned the revelation of a picture being proudly displayed at Epstein's home was 'incredibly damaging' for the embattled royal.
One told the Sun: 'Epstein cultivated powerful friends and would show them off in pictures around all of his homes.
'This is incredibly damaging for Prince Andrew because it shows how highly Jeffrey prized his friendship with a senior member of the Royal Family. His picture was shown off in Jeffrey's home like a trophy.'
Sources indicated the scandal-hit royal faces further public scrutiny as news of the picture emerged.
The source continued: 'Andrew's reputation is hit every time something like this emerges - and he is already facing another year of further lurid headlines.'
In his 2019 Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew admitted he had visited Epstein's Florida home, but denied making repeated visits.
He explained: 'I definitely did not visit his Palm Beach house three or four times a year, absolutely not. In total, probably four times in total throughout the time that I knew him.
'In fact probably that was the place that...if you see what I mean, he was in the house more there than in other...in other places that I was at. But it was usually because I was going...I was going through and on somewhere else so it was a day, that was it.'  
Other newly released pictures showed the financier donning a kilt as he poses with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is pictured elsewhere riding a motorbike near Scotland's Skibo Castle. 
Friday marked the latest development in the Epstein saga, as the Duke of York faces a US lawsuit from Virginia Roberts Giuffre who claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew.
The Duke of York also faced a fresh headache this week when campaigners and experts warned his finances should be investigated by MPs and tax authorities.
Prince Andrew faced mounting scrutiny on Tuesday over whether he broke the Royal Family’s conduct rules by accepting a £1.5million off-shore payment from Tory donor and long-term friend David Rowland.
The Queen’s scandal-hit second son received the payment days before he paid off a loan from the financier’s own Luxembourg bank.
Buckingham Palace conduct rules state that royals should ‘never accept gifts of money, or money equivalent, in connection with an official engagement or duty’.
The Duke of York has previously been accused of attending naked pool parties and receiving massages by Epstein's former butler Juan Alessi, 70.  
Alessi, who started working for Epstein in 1991, has previously been interviewed by the FBI, police and victims' lawyers and said the Prince stayed for 'weeks at a time' in a sworn statement to Palm Beach police in 2005.  
Prince Andrew has consistently denied all sexual allegations made against him.  
Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges that alleged he abused women and girls under the age 18 at the Florida estate and his Manhattan mansion in the early 2000s. 
The waterfront property became the epicentre where he groomed and sexually assaulted underage girls and women as part of a sprawling sex trafficking scheme, prosecutors said.
The house was where the crimes that would eventually lead to his downfall were first reported in 2005.
Epstein had been recruiting underage girls for 'massages' from Palm Beach high school and one eventually confessed to her mother what was going on, who then went to the police.
The girls would be hired to massage Epstein in their underwear or totally naked. Often the massages progressed to sexual touching as Epstein allegedly used vibrators on the girls and masturbated.
He paid them hundreds of dollars at a time with another $200 going to other schoolgirls who recruited them to go to mansion on Palm Beach's El Brillo Way.
Dozens of victims were underprivileged middle and high school girls recruited in and around Palm Beach County between 1998 and 2006.
Earlier this year, demolition crews ripped down the notorious Palm Beach mansion where the financier sexually assaulted young girls. 
The property, which had stood since 1952 and was bought by Epstein in 1990 for around £2million, included a main house, a pool cabana building and another staff house - all of which were demolished.  
Developer Todd Michael Glaser purchased the sprawling Palm Beach estate for $18.5million (£13.7m) and he sighed 'finally' as the first bulldozers began raising the house of horrors to the ground on April 18.
Glaser, who has previously said it would be personally satisfying to tear down the mansion due to its horrific history, said he plans to replace it with a 14,000-square-foot 'Art Moderne home'.",-2
196," Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges on Friday, marking the end of a dramatic and divisive two-week murder trial that had sparked debate over gun rights in the US.  
Lawyers for the 18-year-old managed to successfully convince the jury that their client acted in self-defense when he fatally shot two men during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha last August. 
The verdict ended one of the highest-profile civilian self-defense cases in the US, and also marked a career-defining trial for defense attorneys Mark Richards and Corey Chirafisi.  
LEAD DEFENSE ATTORNEY MARK RICHARDS 
Richards, a Racine-based criminal defense attorney, led the defense in fighting charges of first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree attempted intentional homicide and first-degree reckless endangerment.   
The 59-year-old lawyer has spent most of his career representing clients accused of homicide, drug charges, sexual assault, burglary, and other crimes, after earning his law degree from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1987. 
Richards is well known and respected in legal circles, having served as prosecutor in Kenosha and Racine counties before starting his own practice in 1990. He is currently a partner at Richards & Dimmer, S.C. in Racine.
On his firm's website, he boasts of his 'leave no stone unturned' type of representation, his experience working on 'over 100 jury trials' - which he describes ranging from 'simple two-day' DUI cases to 'month-long' homicide trials. 
Among his most notable courtroom victories was in 1999, when Wisconsin prisoner Kurtis King, who was accused of strangling his cellmate, was cleared of first-degree intentional homicide charges after raising questions about the guards' credibility.
More recently, in 2019, Richards represented Tyler, 22, and Jacob, 25, Huffines who were accused of running an illegal marijuana vape operation from their family home.
Fellow Racine attorney Robert Keller vouched for Richards's success as a formidable lawyer and his 'gruff and aggressive' reputation in an interview with Kenosha News earlier this month. 
'He's always carried himself that way,' he said. 'In criminal cases, generally speaking, that's an excellent trait for someone to have.' 
Brian Dimmer, Richards's partner at their Racine law firm, said his colleague's best asset is being able to 'exude confidence from the position of his client,' and added that juries 'are captivated by that confidence.' 
A Journal Times feature 20 years ago described Richards  as 'hot-headed, impulsive and loud.' 
His former associate Christy Hall said Richards was 'abrupt, both inside and outside of the court,' in a 2001 interview.    
Jurors indeed got a glimpse of that during the defense's opening statements when Richards said the N-word twice as he repeated the words of one the men his client shot dead last year. 
Outside of the court, Richards is an avid swimmer, sailor and skier, according to the Journal Times. 
He was first team All-Racine County in swimming at Park High School in 1980 and is said to swim almost every day at a local YMCA.  
Among the key moments of the trial was the defense's risky decision to allow Rittenhouse to take the stand. 
Rittenhouse broke down sobbing as he recalled the events and portrayed himself as wanting to help others by providing medical aid and extinguishing fires. He said he used his gun only after being attacked and ambushed. 
ATTORNEY COREY CHIRAFISI
Of the defense duo, attorney Corey Chirafisi, is a little smoother around the edges. 
A former prosecutor based in Madison, Wisconsin, Chirafisi joined Rittenhouse's legal team as Richards's co-counsel six months before the explosive trial.
He also has his own private practice, Chirafisi & Verhoff Law Office, S.C., and has been on the Top 25 Super Lawyers in Madison list for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, according to his website.   
He's described as having devoted his career to 'solely to defending individuals charged with criminal and drunk driving offenses.' 
Chirafisi, was born in Burlington, Wisconsin, earned his law degree at The City University of New York School of Law and was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 1998.
He attended Burlington High School where he played baseball and apparently took an interest in law and public policy, having participated in a mock city council in 1985.
However, his roots in law and litigation can be traced further back to when he was 11, when his parents launched a $70,000 lawsuit against his dentist for allegedly extracting the wrong tooth, according to a Journal Times report in 1983. 
In a 2014 promotional video describing his style, he said: 'I try to be the style of lawyer I didn't like to litigate against when I was a prosecutor. I like to be the lawyer who causes as many problems for the government as I can.'  
When the defense requested a mistrial ahead at the announcement of the verdict Friday, attorney Chirafisi argued that they initially received an inferior copy of a potentially crucial video from prosecutors.
ATTORNEY NATALIE WISCO 
Attorney Natalie Wisco played a small but crucial role in the defense's motion for a mistrial earlier this week, which argued in part that the state failed to provide high-definition drone footage central to their case in a timely fashion.
Wisco was brought on the team from Richards's law firm, where she has worked as criminal defense attorney since 2017. 
According to her profile, Wisco has dedicated her practice to representing clients in cases involving juvenile delinquency, restraining orders, parents in CPS actions and appellate cases.   
She attended the University of Iowa as an undergrad before earning her Special Recognition for Public Service and Certificate in Litigation Practice Marquette University Law School in 2017. 
Wisco addressed the court for the first time in proceedings on Wednesday, when the defense claimed they were initially sent a 3.6 megabyte file with a lower quality footage of Rittenhouse 'pointing his gun' at people' while the prosecution used an 11.2 megabyte copy.
She explained that she had never viewed the footage on her phone and that the file name and creation time of the footage supplied by the state on November 5 was different to that of the high-definition footage of which they only learned later. 
The difference was only exposed in court Friday, she explained, when the state did not have an exhibit ready for the judge to view and so she played the defense's version - which was markedly different in quality.
'This is your best picture?' asked the judge of the blurry image – a request that prompted Kraus's admission that they had better.
On Wednesday Wisco was blunt.
'There is no way that what ADA Kraus is saying is true because the file name [we received] should have been exactly the same as the one provided to the state crime lab,' she said.",-2
197,"There's a sexy new show coming to Sin City.
And Channing Tatum paved the way for a male review unlike any other with the Finding Magic Mike HBO Max stripper reality show competition. 
In a new trailer for the seven-episode series, average Joes' who have 'lost their magic' compete for a chance to not only take the stage in the hottest male review in Las Vegas, but also earn a handsome cash prize.
'The hottest show in Vegas is giving ordinary guys a chance to work their magic,' a narrator said as the scene set over the sparkling city skyline.
From executive producers Channing Tatum and Steven Soderbergh, a group of men are challenged with the task of becoming the next best erotic dancer.
'We searched the country to find guys who feel like they've lost their magic,' a producer quipped in a confessional.
'This isn't just about taking your clothes off - you're coming to see a show.'
Men are put through boot-camp-like competitions and perform routines to throngs of men and women while vying for the ultimate prize. 
Competitors 'strip down both literally and figuratively as they rid themselves of emotional baggage and regain their mojo … but only one will be the Real Magic Mike.'
'Who is bringing the whole package?' flashes across the screen in bold blue lettering as dancers rip their clothes off.
'We're creating monsters,' another dancer chimed in. 
Magic Mike first debuted on the silver screen in June 2012 and was loosely based on Channing's experiences as an 18-year-old stripper in Tampa Bay, Florida.
The film's all-star cast included Matthew McConaughey, Riley Keough, Joe Manganiello, Alex Pettyfer and Olivia Munn. 
Its sequel, Magic Mike XXL, was released in 2015, and also featured Jada Pinkett Smith, Donald Glover, Andie MacDowell, Amber Heard and Elizabeth Banks. ",-2
198,"Civil rights activist and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has called Kyle Rittenhouse a 'white supremacist' after the 18-year-old was found not guilty at his murder trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Friday.
'We just witnessed a system built on white supremacy validate the terroristic acts of a white supremacist,' Kaepernick tweeted after the verdict was revealed. 'This only further validates the need to abolish our current system. White supremacy cannot be reformed.'
Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges after pleading self-defense in the deadly Kenosha shootings that became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the US. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26 were shot dead and a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, was wounded by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020, during protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of African-American man Jacob Blake. 
The verdict in the politically combustible case was met with anger and disappointment from those who saw Rittenhouse as a vigilante and a wannabe cop, and relief and vindication from those who regarded him as a patriot who wanted to stop lawlessness and exercised his Second Amendment right to carry a gun and to defend himself.
Kaepernick was not the only athlete to condemn the verdict.
Robert Griffin III, another free agent quarterback, referenced the case of Julius Jones, whose death sentence for murder was commuted in Oklahoma this week. Jones, an African-American inmate, was scheduled to be killed on Thursday for the 1999 shooting death of Paul Howell. His sentence was commuted to life in prison, although many still maintain that he has been falsely accused.
'Kyle Rittennhouse can kill without a sliver of doubt & walk free but Julius Jones is in jail for life without the chance for parole after being on death row for 20 years with all types of doubt in his case,' Griffin tweeted. 'What is Justice? God help us.' 
Chiney Ogwumike, a star player for the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, called on social justice advocates to continue to protest: 'Yet again, a necessary reminder that social justice is not a moment, it is a movement.'  
African-American NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace also weighed in: 'Ha, let the boy be black and it would've been life…hell he would've had his life taken before the bulls*** trial.. sad'
Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant wrote that he was 'not surprised at all.'
Kaepernick has been the face of athlete activism since 2016, when he famously began protesting racism and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games.
He has remained a free agent since March of 2017, sparking accusations that the NFL has colluded to blackball Kaepernick, who has since settled a grievance with the league for an undisclosed amount.
The former University of Nevada star continues to train in hope making a comeback.
Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering for killing two men and wounding a third with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle in the summer of 2020 during a tumultuous night of protests over the shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake, by a white Kenosha police officer. 
Rittenhouse, a then-17-year-old former police youth cadet, said he went to Kenosha to protect property from rioters. He is white, as were those he shot.
The anonymous jury, whose racial makeup was not disclosed by the court but appeared to be overwhelmingly white, deliberated for close to 3 1/2 days.
Rittenhouse could have gotten life in prison if found guilty on the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide, or what some other states call first-degree murder. Two other charges each carried over 60 years behind bars.
Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said his office respects the jury's decision, and he asked the public to 'accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.'",-2
199,"While the liberal media was busy prosecuting Kyle Rittenhouse of murder before the juror found him not guilty on all counts, DailyMail.com continued to dig deeper, breaking stories to get to the bottom of the events of August 25, 2020.
Over the course of the trial, DailyMail.com revealed how the prosecution withheld evidence, the chilling content of the death threats received by the judge and the true character of the state's 'star witness' who they tried to paint as a hero.   
And while many are surprised at the verdict, those watching the trial closely will see that the prosecution was doomed from the start, with DailyMail.com revealing that even the Kenosha District Attorney passed the case off to his ADA Thomas Binger because he knew it was a losing proposition.
Below are DailyMail.com's top exclusive stories from the trial that help tell the story of the high-profile Kenosha shooter case that has divided the nation and sparked days of protests.  
Prosecution withheld evidence 
Prosecutors in the Kenosha shooter trial withheld evidence from the defense that was 'at the center of their case,' only sharing the high-definition drone video footage on which they have hung their prosecution after the trial had concluded, DailyMail.com revealed.
Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger played the enhanced drone footage to the jury during his closing statements and claimed that it showed Rittenhouse 'pointing his gun' at people – an assertion that opened the door to the state claiming Rittenhouse provoked the violence of the night of August 25, 2020.
But in the motion obtained by DailyMail.com, Rittenhouse's defense insisted that the state only shared it with the defense after evidence had closed on Saturday November 13.
This is one just one of the grounds on which they made a motion for a mistrial with prejudice filed by Kyle Rittenhouse's defense Monday afternoon.
According to the motion, 'On November 5, 2021, the fifth day of trial on this case, the prosecution turned over to the defense footage of a drone video which captured some of the incident from August 25, 2020.
'The problem is the prosecution gave the defense a compressed version of the video. What that means is the video provided to the defense was not as clear as the video kept by the state.'
The motion goes onto explain that the file size of the defense video is just 3.6MB while the prosecution's is 11.2MB.
The motion states that this larger file was not provided to the defense 'until after the trial concluded'
It reads, 'During the jury instructions conference, the defense played their version of the video for the court to review. The state indicated their version was much clearer and had their tech person come into court to have the court review their clearer video. The video is the same, the resolution of that video, however, was not.' 
The motion states, 'As it relates to the compressed drone footage. The prosecution should be required to explain to the court why they did not copy the footage for the defendant with the same quality as their copy
'The video footage has been at the center of this case. The idea that the state would provide lesser quality footage and then use that footage as a linchpin in their case is the very reason they requested and were granted the provocation instruction by the Court.'
Prosecution's  star witness is a career criminal 
The prosecution's star witness in the Kyle Rittenhouse case had a criminal charge dismissed just six days before the trial's start, meaning the jury had no insight into his extensive criminal record nor his history of lying to police, DailyMail.com revealed.
Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger was well aware of this when he paraded Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, the third man shot on the night of August 25, 2020, as a paragon of selfless virtue. He was a paramedic, the court heard, just there that evening to provide medical aid, as he claimed to have done at countless other protests across the country.
In fact, DailyMail.com learned, he is a violent career criminal with a laundry list of prior offenses and convictions stretching back more than a decade.
These include domestic abuse, prowling, trespass, two DUIs, felony burglary and two charges of carrying a firearm while intoxicated - one of which took place when he was banned as a felon from carrying a firearm.
He also has a history of showing disdain for the law by lying to, and failing to co-operate with, police.
But the Rittenhouse jury heard none of this.
Because just six days before he took the stand, Grosskreutz was before a judge himself at a hearing at which a pending DUI charge – a second offense that saw him three times over the legal limit – was dismissed on a technicality.
Grosskreutz's attorney successfully filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence on the basis that the traffic stop from which it had been obtained had been unlawful.
Police pulled Grosskreutz over on October 6, 2020, for failure to use a signal but under Wisconsin law if there is no other vehicle present a signal is not necessary.
Vile emails sent to judge include threats to 'spit directly into his face' and 'payback' against his children
The judge presiding over the Kyle Rittenhouse trial was slammed as a racist and had his life threatened in a torrent of abusive and menacing emails, letters, postcards and faxes received by Kenosha County Courthouse and seen by DailyMail.com
DailyMail.com reviewed the hundreds of offensive communications sent to Judge Bruce Schroeder, and today we can reveal the extraordinary outpouring of vitriol that the high-profile trial has inspired.
One email, sent last week, reads simply, 'Wow way to name a white skinhead hot head to be a judge. No wonder they burn down your city.'
Others calls for the 'racist' judge, the longest serving in the county, to be dismissed and disbarred.
One addressed to 'Your Honor' reads, 'I didn't know that under your black robes of justice you wear a white robe of the klan. There is no way a fair trial can be heard under your supervision. Better yet, resign.'
Among the most disturbing messages to the judge was one that threatens the lives of the judge's children, promises 'pay back,' and states that Rittenhouse 'won't live long' if acquitted.
The email, much of which is too offensive to reproduce, states the hope that one day Judge Schroeder's 'kids become victims to the most heinous homicide known to man so he feels the pain an [sic]we will call his kids not victims but b******s.'
It is one of a deluge of hate-filled missives that were sent as a direct response to the judge's ruling last month that prosecutors could not refer to Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz - the men shot by Rittenhouse - as 'victims.'
Meanwhile he permitted the defense to use the terms 'looters' and 'rioters' when describing the events of the night of August 25, 2020, when Rittenhouse shot the three men during a night of BLM protests and rioting.
The unrest flared last summer in the wake of a Kenosha police shooting of black man, Jacob Blake. It was in Blake's name that some of the people present marched across three nights that descended into violence during which Kenosha burned.
Another sinister email sent in reaction to the October ruling reads, 'This is outrageous…What fresh hell is this???? Rittenhouse is a murderous thug and trying to protect him says a LOT about this judge.
'We are watching.'
It continues, 'Enjoy your term, judge, it's going to be your LAST. If I ever meet you in person, I fully intend to spit directly into your face, regardless the cost. You're disgusting.'
The emailer signs off, as many do, using his full name.  
'Jump-kick man' who kicked Rittenhouse in the face is a career criminal
A career criminal and convicted felon with an open domestic violence charge has claimed to be the unidentified male at whom Kyle Rittenhouse shot twice at close range but missed, on the night of August 25, 2020.
Rittenhouse was charged with First Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety of the man known in trial only as 'jump-kick man,' for the flying kick he took at the teenager's head as Rittenhouse was attacked minutes after he shot Joseph Rosenbaum dead. 
Maurice Freeland, 39, admitted that he was the one who kicked Rittenhouse in the head and narrowly avoided being shot as a result, after the then 17-year-old stumbled to the ground as he attempted to flee. 
The state has painted all these actors, including those Rittenhouse killed and injured, as heroes attempting to take down an 'active shooter.'  
It emerged that the same is true of 'jump-kick man' who was on bond that night for an alleged assault on his girlfriend that included kicking her in the ribcage having thrown her to the floor.
DailyMail.com already revealed that both Huber and Grosskreutz have lengthy and violent criminal histories, with the latter having a history of lying to police. 
DailyMail.com revealed that the man he painted a hero was out on bond having been charged with Battery Domestic Abuse, Criminal Damage to Property Domestic Abuse and Disorderly Conduct Domestic Abuse for an incident that took place on March 23, 2020.
Court records obtained by DailyMail.com detail the night in question – a night during which Freeland and his partner Monalisa N McDuffie had both been drinking.
Police responded to a call about 'family trouble,' at approximately 12.19am.
Kenosha District Attorney knew the case was a losing proposition and passed the buck to his ADA Thomas Binger
Mike Graveley, the Kenosha County DA would normally have taken the case himself, but instead handed it down to assistant DA Thomas Binger, whose presentation of the case in Wisconsin has been marked with missteps and clashes with Judge Bruce Schroeder.
'Binger was set up for failure,' one Kenosha legal insider told Dailymail.com. 'Graveley is the superstar and he knew this one was sure to tarnish it.'
According to conservative outlet Milwaukee Right Now, Graveley 'pawned the case off to his unfortunate assistant district attorney, Thomas Binger, who was left to spin gold out of a pile of self-defense straw.' 
'He has said things in court that have been ruled out of order, but once they have been said, you can't unring that bell,' Kevin Mathewson, a criminal defense investigator and former Kenosha City alderman told DailyMail.com.
'This is how Binger has always operated. He pushes the envelope as far as he possibly can — but this time the whole world is watching him.'
Mathewson, who was unsuccessfully sued over a Facebook page in which he asked for people to turn up with guns to defend property during the August 2020 Kenosha riots, has been a frequent critic of Graveley's office.
But he says he respects the DA's prosecuting skills. 'He is by far the best prosecutor in the office and he should be the one prosecuting the Rittenhouse trial — the most high-profile and difficult case his office is ever likely to handle.
'It's not that he hides from publicity. Earlier this year he prosecuted a teenager called Martice Fuller who killed his high school sweetheart and shot at her mother.
'That was a high-profile case, but it wasn't a difficult case to prosecute,' added Mathewson. 'There was video of the shooting.
'Just about any prosecutor could have got a conviction.'
Mathewson is not the only one who is hammering Graveley for his absence from the Rittenhouse case. Graveley himself said he would not lead the prosecution as he was investigating the case against the cop who shot Joseph Blake, leading to the unrest in Kenosha during which Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber.
Gravely — who was named Wisconsin's prosecutor of the year earlier this month — decided way back in January that the officer should not be prosecuted for the shooting which left Blake paralyzed. The DA also said he has to prosecute another case which will likely start before the Rittenhouse case is over.
But those excuses are getting short shrift from some, who believe Rittenhouse either should never have been prosecuted or should have faced lesser charges.
'It's time to put DA Mike Graveley's picture on a milk carton,' wrote Milwaukee Right Now. 
Anti Kyle Rittenhouse protestor was once charged with making terrorist threats against his former high school 
The young man arrested after scuffling with a Kyle Rittenhouse supporter outside the courthouse was once charged with making terrorist threats against his former high school.
Anthony Chacon, 20, is now facing charges of battery, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest following his latest run-in with the law.
But the day before school re-opened in September 2019 he posted a picture of himself pointing a gun on Snapshot, along with a message threatening Westosha Central High School in Paddock Lake, Wisconsin.
He used the N-word in his threat, according to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com.
'Young n***a gon hop ina gym shoot everything but the rim,' Chacon — who is white according to his police booking details — allegedly wrote. The words come from Till The End, a rap song by YNW Melly.
The case was eventually dismissed and Chacon pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct.
Chacon, who now lives in Kenosha, was one of two people arrested Wednesday as tempers frayed outside the city's courthouse. The second, Shaquita Cornelious, 34, whose Facebook page describes her as the co-chairman of Black Lives Matter of Lake County, Illinois, was charged with disorderly conduct.
Video taken by DailyMail.com showed Chacon, wearing a F**k Kyle T-shirt, Simpsons backpack, and Chicago Bulls beanie, clashing with prominent Rittenhouse supporter Emily Cahill on the courthouse steps.
The two traded X-rated insults before Chacon threw a sign at Cahill. He and fellow anti-Rittenhouse protestors tried to wrestle the sign back and as he was being pulled off Cahill, he sucker-punched a reporter in the jaw.
Other protestors tried unsuccessfully to lead Chacon away and calm him down, but he then went on to strike several other people — including a DailyMail.com photographer — before being pinned to the ground and hauled away in a paddywagon.
He was heard calling for his mom as the vehicle pulled away.
The flurry of violence came after supporters of both sides had been sharing pizza as they awaited the verdict for the second day.
Chacon is no stranger to the courts. He has a record of being charged with minor offences. In September last year, he and his girlfriend Rachael Randle got in a fight at their Kenosha apartment that spilled out into the street.
A woman flagged down two cops to tell them that Chacon and Randle were 'holding knives and attempting to stab one another.
The witness said Randle ran up the staircase but Chacon caught her and threw her down the stairs. Randle told police the fight started after she tried to evict Chacon from her apartment.
'Ms. Randle stated that (Chacon) yelled at her with his fists clenched in an aggressive manner,' the police report said. The only visible injury that Randle received was 'a small cut on her forehead along the hairline.'
That case has not yet been resolved.
In another case also still to be resolved, he was charged with battery in December last year after allegedly getting involved in a fight between two cousins over a woman.
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse has argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges that the judge could put before the jury in final instructions:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
Former Waukesha County District Attorney Paul Bucher said prosecutors' decision to charge reckless instead of intentional homicide shows they don't know what happened between Rittenhouse and Rosenbaum and what might have been going through Rittenhouse's mind when he pulled the trigger.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Judge Bruce Schroeder to let the jury also consider a lesser charge, second-degree reckless homicide, that does not require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. It's punishable by up to 25 years in prison. But after Rittenhouse's attorneys objected, Schroeder said he did not plan to give that instruction. He said he expected that a guilty verdict on that count would be overturned because the defense objected to adding it.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to give the jury the option of second-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide and second-degree reckless homicide in Huber's death. The defense objected only to the second-degree reckless homicide charge, and Schroeder said he 'embraced' that argument.
Second-degree intentional homicide is a fallback charge when a defendant believed he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that it was necessary to use force - but either belief was unreasonable. It's punishable by up to 60 years in prison.
The first-degree reckless homicide charge sought in Huber's death matches an original charge in Rosenbaum's death - it would require jurors to decide that Rittenhouse caused Huber's death with an utter disregard for human life - and is punishable by up to 60 years in prison.
COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
Prosecutors asked that the jury be allowed to consider lesser counts in the Grosskreutz shooting: second-degree attempted intentional homicide, first-degree reckless endangerment and second-degree reckless endangerment. Defense attorneys didn't oppose the first, but did oppose adding the reckless endangerment counts. Schroeder didn't rule but said he was inclined to side with prosecutors.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it",-2
200,"Children are quick to find nicknames for their teachers — the cheekier the better. But Kath Tregenna is thrilled with hers. And for good reason.
To her young pupils at the International School of London who clearly adore their smiley, vivacious teacher, Kath is quite simply the Bionic Woman.
It's testament not simply to the amazing pair of bionic arms Kath now sports, but to the extraordinary spirit which has seen her return to work despite having all four limbs amputated.
Just like TV's Bionic Woman — played by Lindsay Wagner and coincidentally also a teacher with superhuman powers — Kath's courage and determination are awe inspiring.
Almost exactly two years after her family were summoned to come and say their goodbyes to her in hospital, Kath is back doing what she loves best.
And thanks to her amazing arms, she does everything from driving herself to school to writing on the whiteboard and coming up with fun maths activities.
She's not only had to learn how to use the so-called Hero Arms, which have clever sensors that can detect the tiniest muscle signals and turn them into hand movements. 
She's also had to teach herself to walk again on prosthetic legs — and all while caring for her two children: Aaron, 12, and eight-year-old Emily.
'I know life can never be exactly the same,' says Kath, 47, who lives in Datchet, Berkshire with her partner, Alvin, 48, a carpenter, and their children. 'But I refuse to look back. After coming so close to losing everything, I am just so overwhelmingly grateful to be alive.'
Kath's old life was eviscerated over a single terrifying weekend in late November 2019, when sepsis tore through her body. 
A life-threatening reaction to an infection — in Kath's case pneumonia — sepsis occurs when the immune system overreacts and begins to damage the body's tissues and organs.
'It all started at school on Friday afternoon. I began feeling unwell — queasy and terribly hot,' recalls Kath. 'I know now I was developing pneumonia.
'I decided to leave early and go home for some rest. I walked out, leaving my papers on my desk expecting to be back fighting fit on Monday morning.
'I spent the weekend in bed — only dragging myself out with the kids to see the Christmas lights in Windsor.'
But far from feeling better, by Sunday afternoon Kath was physically sick and feeling so feverish that she rang 111. Mercifully, the call handler realised something was very wrong and, despite Kath's protests, ordered an ambulance.
'I owe her my life,' says Kath. 'I'd never felt this sick before but it never occurred to me that I could be dangerously ill.
'As they took me out to the ambulance, I even promised the kids I would be back for breakfast. I also rang my headteacher from my mobile and warned her I might be late into school.
'I never thought I wouldn't be back for two years.'
Kath's condition deteriorated at devastating speed. Within hours of arriving at Slough's Wexham Park Hospital and being diagnosed with sepsis, triggered by pneumonia, she suffered up to 11 cardiac arrests as well as multiple organ failure and had to be put into an induced coma.
At 1.30am on Monday morning, police arrived at the family home to summon Alvin and the children to say their goodbyes. Hospital staff also rang Kath's father, Keith, 78, a retired law lecturer in Cornwall and urged him to get to Kath's bedside.
'I can't begin to imagine what it was like for them,' says Kath who tragically lost her own mum, Sylvia, to cancer when she was just 13. 'One minute the kids were walking around Windsor with me, admiring the Christmas lights. The next they were being told Mummy was going to die.
'I looked unrecognisable. My body was bloated from the drugs and I was covered in wires. Emily was so terrified she couldn't even be persuaded to kiss me.
'Alvin managed to keep it together for the children but he must have been in total hell.'
Kath clung onto life by a thread that night. Over and over again during the next few days, the family were warned to get ready for the worst. A counsellor was assigned to the children to help prepare them for losing their mum.
'She told them in no uncertain terms that I was going to die,' shudders Kath. 'The doctors told Alvin and Dad that it would take a miracle to save me.'
Incredibly, that miracle came just in time for Christmas. One of the doctors remembered reading about a drug which had proved successful in boosting the effectiveness of the antibiotics they were already trying.
It had only been used on a handful of patients. But, with nothing to lose, it was administered to Kath.
Very slowly, over the next few days, the sepsis abated. Although Kath remained in a coma, two weeks after she arrived in hospital the family finally dared hope she would live.
But sepsis had wreaked terrible damage. When Kath regained consciousness in early January last year, she was faced with the terrible truth.
Sepsis had stopped the blood flowing properly to her extremities and gangrene had set in. Her hands, her feet and much of her legs were dying and only an amputation could stop the infection spreading further.
'It was too much to take in,' she says. 'I could see that my hands and feet were black. There was no sensation and I couldn't move them.
'But I couldn't understand why. My last memory was getting into the ambulance two months before. My family and the doctors had to explain over and over what had happened.
'At first I was numb with shock. But, when I understood there was no choice, it was an easy decision. Besides, these black, horrible limbs didn't feel part of me any more.'
She adds: 'I remember Alvin looking at me and saying: 'Kath, you've survived. This is such a small price to pay.'
'When I thought how close our kids had come to losing me, I realised he was right. I, above everyone, know the reality of losing a mum.'
Kath had both her hands amputated just above the wrist on January 10 last year.
'At first they were bandaged up so I couldn't see anything,' she says. 'My biggest concern was what the children would think. When they visited after the operation, I moved my arms from under the covers so they could see there was nothing to fear.
'I was determined to find the positives. I remember saying: 'Mummy will get some new arms made. They won't be exactly like my old ones but they will be great.'
'Of course, at that stage I was winging it — I hadn't even heard of Hero Arms.'
Two weeks later, on January 24, 2020, Kath had both her legs amputated. To her relief, doctors were able to save her knees which gave her the chance of more mobility.
Even so, adapting to her new normal was heartwrenching. 'I thought I'd prepared myself,' she says. 'But it's impossible to imagine what it's like to wake up with no legs.
'I would never be able to walk or stand again unaided. It was a victory when the physio got me to shuffle my bottom down the bed.'
Kath hoped to be transferred to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital to have prosthetic arms and legs fitted. But, when the pandemic hit, she was told she'd have to wait.
'It was a blow,' she says. 'But at least it meant I could get home sooner — even though it would be in a wheelchair. The kids were desperate to have me back.'
In April, her occupational therapist pushed Kath through her front door. Alvin, the children and her dad were there to greet her.
'That first day was pure joy,' she says. 'The kids made a huge fuss of me. Just being able to kiss and cuddle them in my own home was wonderful. I don't think I have ever been happier to be alive.
'Then the reality hit me. Inside I was the same but physically I was a totally different person. Everything was a challenge. I had no devices. I could only feed myself by balancing a spoon between my stumps and lifting it very carefully to my mouth. In those first few weeks, food went everywhere.
'I couldn't get up the stairs so we had to put a hospital bed in the sitting room. Aaron was really protective and was always ready to fetch me a glass of water or a snack. Emily loved to brush my hair.'
There was so much to re-learn, but in one area Kath discovered she still excelled — teaching. While many parents loathed homeschooling during the pandemic, for Kath it was a chance to reconnect with her old self.
'It was the old Kath coming back,' says Kath who's been teaching for more than 20 years in the UK, America and the Caribbean, where she met Alvin. 'I've always loved my job. I guess I'm a natural born teacher.
'Sitting with Emily and Aaron — doing all the things I'd normally do in the classroom — was magic. I felt needed and useful. For the first time I dared hope I might get back into the classroom.'
So she was thrilled when, in July last year, she was fitted for prosthetic legs and started learning to walk again with weekly physio sessions as an outpatient at the John Radcliffe Hospital.
'By the time I was allowed to take them home in October I was so excited, but still very cautious even when walking on a flat floor as bumps are a nightmare. But I could finally walk into the kitchen and pour a drink for myself. It was amazing.'
Kath was also fitted with prosthetic arms. However, these were much less satisfactory. 'They were like hooks — functional but ugly and heavy,' she says. 'I felt embarrassed wearing them.'
Kath had read about UK tech company Open Bionics and their pioneering Hero Arms. Made from tough nylon, Hero Arms use 'myoelectric sensors' to detect the electrical signals made by muscle movements in the existing arm.
They are much lighter than normal prosthetic arms and so clever they can even pick up an egg or hold a wine glass.
But the arms cost between £8,000 and £10,000 each. It's a tribute to Kath's popularity that friends and colleagues, as well as scores of parents past and present, raised £29,000 to help her.
Kath's first Hero Arm — to fit her right arm — arrived just in time for Christmas last year. Her second followed in January.
'It was the best early Christmas present,' she says. 'I'd promised the kids I would have cool new arms one day. And here they were.
'I had to practise like crazy. Basically, you have to imagine what you want to do — whether it's picking up a knife and fork or opening a door. There are three sensors on the inside of the bionic arm and three on the outside which pick up these minute muscle movements in my stumps and transfer them to finger movements.
Her old school pupils — aged from eight to 11 — were desperate to see Kath's bionic arms too. In June, 18 months after she went sick, Kath visited the school.
'The children had lived through the trauma too,' she says. 'I wanted to show them a happy outcome. They were transfixed by the arms.
'They bombarded me with questions and even came up with suggestions on how to improve them. One bright spark even asked: 'Can they shoot lasers?'
Buoyed by their reaction and the encouragement of her colleagues, Kath felt confident enough to return to work in September. 'I'm taking it very slowly and only doing a few hours a week for now because I tire easily,' she says.
'I'm also learning what I can and can't do. I can write on a whiteboard — I am still right-handed — but jumping down to the children's level is another matter.'
And beyond the curriculum she is a living example of some of life's most important lessons like resilience, fortitude and gratitude.
'I hope I can teach them to appreciate life. I certainly do,' she says simply.
'When I look at Aaron and Emily and remember how close they came to losing me, I feel overwhelmed by how lucky I am.'
It's a joy that will be all the more intense this Christmas. 'I can't wait to put the tree up,' she says. 'And this year — thanks to my bionic arms — I will be the one hanging the baubles and wrapping the presents.",-2
201,"Former President Trump congratulated Kyle Rittenhouse on Friday, after the teenager was found not guilty of murder in the fatal shooting of two men in racial justice protests.
The verdict divided America. As the left denounced the outcome as a miscarriage of justice, the right said Rittenhouse never should have been put on trial.
'Congratulations to Kyle Rittenhouse for being found INNOCENT of all charges,' said Trump in an emailed statement.
'It’s called being found NOT GUILTY—And by the way, if that’s not self defense, nothing is!'
A fundraising appeal followed.
'This trial was nothing more than a WITCH HUNT from the Radical Left,' said an email to supporters, directing them to donate to the online WinRed platform. 
'They want to PUNISH law-abiding citizens, including a CHILD, like Kyle Rittenhouse, for doing nothing more than following the LAW.'
Jurors found Rittenhouse, 18, not guilty on all charges: two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety in protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
The outcome triggered anger among many Democrats. 
House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerold Nadler said: 'This heartbreaking verdict is a miscarriage of justice and sets a dangerous precedent which justifies federal review by [the Department of Justice].
'Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest.'
Rittenhouse cannot be tried again for the same alleged crime, and DOJ does not have the authority to prosecute state crimes – although it does probe law enforcement for bias or misconduct.  
President Joe Biden said Friday that he stands by the jury that found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty – as Republicans renewed demands that he apologize for comparing the Kenosha shooter to white supremacists in the wake of the verdict.
'I stand by with the jury as the jury system has concluded. The jury system works and you have to abide by it,' Biden told reporters Friday afternoon as he returned to the White House from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had a physical.
He said he 'just heard a moment ago' about the verdict, and says he 'didn't watch the trial', which featured dramatic clashes between the prosecution and defense lawyers and testimony by the accused teen in an event that got gavel-to-gavel cable news coverage.  
Biden also issued a statement saying he and other Americans were 'angry and concerned' by the verdict. 
Republican lawmakers and other officials are demanding that Biden apologize to Rittenhouse for comparing Rittenhouse to white supremacists following the Wisconsin jury's not-guilty verdict. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), in a statement immediately after the verdict.
'While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken,' Biden said in the official White House statement.
'I ran on a promise to bring Americans together, because I believe that what unites us is far greater than what divides us. I know that we’re not going to heal our country’s wounds overnight, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under the law.'
He also referenced fears of potential violence in Kenosha after the acquittal.
'I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law. Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy. The White House and Federal authorities have been in contact with Governor [Tony] Evers’s office to prepare for any outcome in this case, and I have spoken with the Governor this afternoon and offered support and any assistance needed to ensure public safety.'
Vice President Kamala Harris made brief remarks to reporters on the verdict, saying it 'really speaks for itself. As many of you know, I've spent a majority of my career working to make the criminal justice system more equitable. And, clearly, there's a lot more work to do,' the former prosecutor said.
Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson championed the verdict. 'I believe justice has been served in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial. I hope everyone can accept the verdict, remain peaceful, and let the community of Kenosha heal and rebuild,' he tweeted. 
Last September while running as a presidential candidate, Biden  sent out a tweet condemning Donald Trump for refusing to call anti-BLM protesters white supremacists. It showed the march in Charlottesville as well an image of Rittenhouse's face in Kenosha.
'There’s no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night,' Biden said.
Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel released a statement saying before 'he knew the facts, Biden prejudged the Rittenhouse case. He smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case. What Biden did was dangerous and inflammatory. Biden needs to apologize and ACT NOW before the left uses his lies to fuel violence.'
Lawmakers on both sides of the issue took to Twitter express their relief or anger.
The Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement saying: 'It is unconscionable our justice system would allow an armed vigilante — who traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz — to go free.  
Said Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.): 'I’d like to have faith in our criminal justice system, but the immediate question that comes to mind with this news is “Would he have been acquitted if he were black?' 
Wrote Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-La.): 'I hope this young man realizes that he was given a chance at life - one that we all know might not have been afforded to him if he had been Black - and dedicates himself to repairing the deep rifts in our community and in our country that he created.' 
New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted: 'This is a dark day for our justice system. As a lawyer, I respect jury verdicts. But this is yet another reminder that our system needs to be uprooted and reformed.' 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was informed of the jury's not guilty verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial during the White House press briefing – and promised reporters President Biden would weigh in with a statement.
She was asked about it just seconds after the 12-person jury found Rittenhouse not guilty on all counts of intentional homicide, attempted intentional homicide, or reckless endangerment for shooting and killing two men and injuring another amid protests in Kenosha in August 2020.
'It obviously just happened while I was out here, so let me talk to the president,' Psaki responded, talk to our team, and we will get you a statement as soon as we can,' she said. 
She was asked about Judge Bruce Schroeder decision not to have the term 'victims' used to describe the people that Rittenhouse shot and killed or injured. 'I'm not going to give an assessment of this from here,' she said. 'Let us get you a statement as soon as we can.'
Before the verdict, she said the administration has been 'in close touch with officials on the ground through law enforcement channels to ensure we are supporting any efforts toward peaceful protests. That's certainly what we will continue to encourage as anyone looks to have their voice heard regardless of the outcome.'
 Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all counts Friday afternoon.  
The jury reached a verdict in the Kenosha shooter trial on Friday after four days of deliberation.  
Rittenhouse, 18, was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other counts for killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz on August 25, 2020. 
Demonstrators have been gathered outside the Kenosha Courthouse all week, as Wisconsin governor Tony Evers called in 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard to counter the expected protests.
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that has threatened to derail proceedings more than once. 
Two of the six original charges were dismissed before they ever went to the jury when Judge Schroeder tossed first a curfew violation count and then the one charge that seemed all but a slam-dunk for the prosecution: possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.
The gun charge was dismissed on the grounds that the state failed to satisfy the entire statute which, in Wisconsin, requires not only that the person be under 18 but that the rifle be short-barreled – Rittenhouse's AR-15 was not.",-2
202,"Joe Biden is 'fit for duty,' his doctor declared Friday after the president's routine medical exam, which included a colonoscopy and 'extremely detailed neurologic exam.' 
Biden is ‘fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exceptions or accommodations,' Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the president's longtime physician, wrote in a six-page memo to press secretary Jen Psaki, which was released by the White House. 
In the first public medical report of Biden's presidency, O'Connor addressed a couple of items that had become topic of public discourse - the president's notable increase in coughing and clearing his throat and whether his stiffer gait a symptom of a neurological problem - such as a stroke. 
'There were no findings that which would be consistent with any cerebellar or other central neurological disorder,' the doctor noted, saying the 'extremely detailed neurologic exam was reassuring.'
O'Connor concluded the causes were actually fairly minor issues.  
Biden is experiencing ‘increasing frequency and severity of “throat clearing” and coughing during speaking engagements” over the last few months and it ‘warranted detailed investigation,' the doctor acknowledged. 
The cause was found to be gastroesophageal reflux, which has him ‘clear his throat more often.’ It also contributes to his ‘occasional cough and sinus congestion.’ His symptoms are exacerbated after meals, the report notes. He has no tumors in his sinuses however, and no signs of ulcer or stomach cancer. 
The president, who turns 79 on Saturday, also has an ‘ambulatory gait’ that is ‘perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago.’
That gait distrubance can 'include a variety of neurological pathologies,' Dr. O'Connor acknowledges. He cited the tests he ran to rule them out, saying he had a team of spine, foot and ankle, radiology, physical therapy and movement disorder neurological specialists to 'carefully examine and assess the president.'
The neurological exam found 'no signs of stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or ascending lateral sclerosis,' the memo notes, but did it did find 'a mild peripheral neuropathy in both feet.'
A ‘combination of significant spinal arthritis, post-fracture “limp and compensation” and a mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of the feet are the explanation for the subtle gait changes which I was investigating,' O'Connor writes. 
The doctor noted Biden acknowledges being stiffer in the mornings but that it eases throughout the day, which is attributed to the ‘number of orthopedic and sports related injuries’ the president had over the years, including when he wore a boot on his right foot last year.
Biden would ‘likely benefit from some shoe orthotics' and is in physical therapy, the memo notes. 
President Biden's medical report reveals that he is taking five different medications to ease his allergies, reduce the risk of a stroke and to reduce levels of 'bad' cholesterol.
It also notes that he has 'no known medication allergies'
Apixaban (Eliquis) - anticoagulant medication used to treat and prevent blood clots and to prevent stroke
Rosuvastatin (Crestor) - a statin, used to lower 'bad' cholesterol and raise 'good' cholesterol
Fluticasone/azelastine (Dymista) - a nasal spray antihistamine that prevents runny nose, itching, and sneezing from allergies
Fexofenadine (Allegra) - an over-the-counter medication to tackle the symptoms of allergies
Famotidine (Pepcid) - an over-the-counter treatment for heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which also reduces the risk of stomach ulcers
Biden's colonoscopy found a 'benign-appear polyp' that was easily removed.
'Histologic evaluation is anticipated to be completed early next week,' the doctor noted. 'The president has never had colon cancer.'
O’Connor first started treating Biden in 2009 when he was vice president and he was the doctor wrote Biden's last public medical report, which was released in December 2019 during the presidential campaign. O'Connor is a retired US Army colonel who served in the 82nd Airborne Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army Special Operations Command. 
Biden is 5’11’ and 184 pounds with a BMI of 25. His blood pressure was 120/70. He ‘does not use any tobacco products, does not drink alcohol and works out five days a week.’
The six-page memo on his health concludes with: ‘This patient’s current medical considerations … include a-fib with normal ventricular response, hyperlipidemia, gastresophagel reflux, seasonal allergies, spinal arthritis and mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of both feet. For these, he takes three common prescription medications and two common over-the-counter medications.’
‘President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those of chief executive, head of state and commander in chief.’
Biden told reporters he felt 'great' after his exam conclude on Friday. The tests included him going under anesthesia for a colonoscopy and putting Vice President Kamala Harris in charge of the country.
The president disembarked from Marine One and appeared to walk slowly and stiffly across the South Lawn upon his return from spending around five hours at Walter Reed Medical Center. 
'They're going to release all the details. I feel great. Nothing's changed,' Biden said of his first physical exam as president.
'I'm looking forward to celebrating my 58th birthday,' he joked. Biden turns 79 on Saturday.   
Biden took power back at 11:35 a.m. EDT, after speaking with Harris and White House chief of staff Ron Klain. He reliquished power at 10:10 a.m. EDT, leaving Harris in charge of the country for one hour and 25 minutes. 
'.@POTUS spoke with @VP and @WHCOS at approximately 11:35am this morning. @POTUS was in good spirits and at that time resumed his duties. He will remain at Walter Reed as he completes the rest of his routine physical,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote on Twitter. 
The White House said Harris worked out of her office in the West Wing, meaning she was not in the Oval Office as she assumes presidential power. Harris takes over amid reports she is being sidelined by the administration, which the White House has vigorously denied. 
Harris, the first female and first black vice presidential, made history with her time holding presidential power. 
Psaki called it 'another chapter' in the history Harris' selection as VP has made. 'I think that will be noted for many women, young girls across the country,' she said during her daily press briefing.
President Biden headed to Walter Reed for his physical as the Democrats passed his $1.75 trillion Build Back Better spending bill and days after a poll said American voters were split on whether he is mentally fit and healthy enough to handle the presidency. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends regular screenings for colon cancer starting at age 45. A colonoscopy can last about an hour. George W. Bush was the last president to undergo a colonoscopy with anesthesia while in office. And he transferred power to then Vice President Cheney in both 2002 and 2007 when he under went the procedure. 
Biden's motorcade arrived at Walter Reed Military Center at 8:51 a.m. EDT on Friday morning, where he was to undergo his first physical as president. It comes the day before his 79th birthday. Biden, wearing a face mask, waved as he went inside.
 Psaki announced early Friday morning that Biden would be examined, adding later he 'will undergo a routine colonoscopy.'  
'As was the case when President George W. Bush had the same procedure in 2002 and 2007, and following the process set out in the Constitution, President Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia. The Vice President will work from her office in the West Wing during this time,' Psaki said.
The White House will publicly release a written summary of the Biden's physical later Friday afternoon, she noted. 
As required by section three of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Biden signed a letter to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives saying he is unable to discharge his duties while under anesthesia and designate Harris. Biden will send them another letter upon the conclusion of the procedure, noting he has resumed his duties of office.  
The White House released copies of the letters to Senator Patrick Leahy and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, where the president relinquished power and then took it back.   
Biden wrote to the leaders he was undergoing a 'routine medical procedure requiring sedation. In view of present circumstances, I have determined to transfer temporarily the power and duties of the office of President of the United States to the Vice President during the brief period of the procedure and recovery.'
He later sent a second letter resuming presidential powers.  
'In accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, I hereby transmit to you my written declaration that I am able to discharge the powers and duties of the Office of the President of the United States and that I am resuming those powers and duties,' Biden wrote.  
Walter Reed Medical Center, a military center in Bethesda, Md., is the traditional hospital of presidents for their medical needs. 
As required by section three of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Biden will sign a letter to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives saying he is unable to discharge his duties while under anesthesia and designate Harris. 
Biden will send them another letter upon the conclusion of the procedure, noting he has resumed his duties of office. 
Presidents have temporarily relinquished power but not all invoked the 25th Amendment. 
Previous transfers of power have generally been brief and happened when the president was undergoing a medical procedure.
In 2002, President George W. Bush became the first to use the amendment’s Section 3 to temporarily transfer power to Vice President Dick Cheney while Bush was anesthetized for a colonoscopy. Bush temporarily transferred power in 2007 to undergo another colonoscopy.
 The 25th Amendment was never invoked after President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Reagan did temporarily transfer power to Vice President George H. W. Bush while undergoing surgery to remove a polyp from his colon in 1985, but he said at the time he wasn’t formally invoking the 25th Amendment.
Donald Trump was treated there when he had COVID. And Trump made a mysterious visit to Walter Reed in November 2019 that was later revealed to be a colonoscopy. At the time the White House said he got a partial physical. 
But former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham indicated in her book on the administration Trump was getting a colonoscopy without anesthesia.
The reason for the secrecy, Grisham explained, was that Trump didn't want to hand over power to Vice President Mike Pence, even for a short amount of time, because it would be 'showing weakness.'
He also didn't want to be 'the butt of the joke,' she wrote, on late-night TV.   
Biden's visit to Walter Reed on Friday comes amid questions about the health of the country's oldest president and, as earlier this week, a new poll found that voters were split on whether Biden is mentally fit enough and healthy enough to handle the presidency. 
Only 40 per cent of voters surveyed in a new Politico/Morning Consult poll agreed with the statement that Biden 'is in good health,' while 50 per cent disagreed.
Biden got a tougher rating when it came to his mental health. 
Asked whether Biden is 'mentally fit', voters were close to an even split: 46 per cent says he is and 48 per cent disagree. 
And asked whether Biden is 'stable,' voters are split again with 44 per cent saying he is and 50 per cent disagreeing.
Psaki declined on Friday to addres the polls' findings.
'There are certainly quite a bit of conspiracy theory pushing out there on a range of social media platforms and even through the mouths of elected officials,' she said.
Voters' opinions on the president's health appear to be shifting with more of them concerned about his fitness. 
In October 2020, when the poll last surveyed the question, voters believed Biden was in good health by a 19-point margin compared to this recent 10 point one. Addtionally, in that October 2020 survey, voters believed Biden was mentally fit by a 21-point margin.
Biden turns 79 on Saturday and the last extensive update on his health came in December 2019 - during the presidential campaign - where his doctor described him as 'a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.'  '  
President Donald Trump, who was 70 when he was elected president, mocked Biden's stamina on the campaign trail in last year's election, dubbing him with the moniker 'Sleepy Joe.' 
Trump's first physical was released in January 2018, a year after he was sworn-in. 
An exuberant Dr. Ronny Jackson, now a Republican House member in Congress, praised Trump for having 'incredible genes,' which allowed the then 71-year-old president to consume Diet Coke, McDonald's, ice cream and exercise very little and still stay in 'very, very good health.'    
'I have absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability,' Jackson also assured reporters, after the book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House had raised questions about Trump's mental state. 
What is a coloscopy? 
A colonoscopy is an exam that detects abnormalities and changes in the large intestine and in the abdomen.
How is it performed?  
Patients are either sedated or, in rare cases, given general anesthesia, to dull the amount of pain they feel.
A long, flexible tube is inserted into the rectum. A tiny video camera is attached to the tip so the doctor can view the inside of the colon.
If necessary, the doctor can remove polyps or other types of abnormal tissue, as well as take tissue samples. 
A colonoscopy will generally take about 30 to 60 minutes. 
How do I prepare the day before a colonoscopy? 
Doctors recommend that patients eat low-fiber foods that are easy to digest starting three to four days before the colonoscopy.
The day before the procedure, patients are not allowed to eat anything solid and can only consume clear liquids.
The night before the colonoscopy, patients have to take laxatives to make sure the digestive tract is clear.
When should I get a colonoscopy?
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adults between ages 45 and 75 get screened for colon cancer.
Patients between ages 75 and 85 are recommended to speak to their doctors about when to get a colonoscopy.  
If the colonoscopy doesn't find any signs of cancer, it should be done every 10 years. 
Why is it important to get a coloscopy?
Aside from skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the U.S.
An estimated 104,270 new cases of colon cancer and 45,230 new cases of rectal cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2021.
It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in men and in women, separately, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths when men and women are combined with 52,980 deaths expected in 2021.

While Trump regularly 'speaks his mind,' Jackson argued, he 'found no reason whatsoever to think that the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process.'  
Biden hasn't helped questions about his health with his tendency toward gaffes - an afflication that has plagued him on and off throughout his more than 40 years in politics. 
In his first few months in office, he would refer to his vice president as 'President Kamala Harris' and White House staff recently had to clarify comments he made on the situation in Taiwan. 
In March, Biden stumbled three times while climbing the stairs to board Air Force One, which his staff blamed on the windy day. 
The president does stay physically active - he and First Lady Jill Biden ride bikes when they are at their vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., and he plays golf at the local country club when he's home in Wilmington.  ",-2
203,"A former Target employee has gone viral for quitting in spectacular fashion with a profanity-laden announcement over the PA system at his Chicago store.
Edwin Pos, 21, shared a TikTok video of himself making the exit speech, which he managed to complete before anyone stopped him.
In the clip, he announces to the store that he is quitting 'this f***ing whole-a** job' and calls out several employees by name, including 'that b**** Jessica' and 'Karen-a*** Lucifer Linda.'
The video shows Edwin talking on speaker phone into a phone in an office appears to be connected to the PA system. 
'Attention Target guests. The time is now nine whatever and I quit, I'm quitting this f***ing whole-a** job,' he begins.
'F*** that b**** Jessica and f*** your p**** a** email, that no-lip b**** Linda who [harasses] the style team daily, which is why we call her that Karen-a*** Lucifer Linda. And your mannequins look like s***,' he said.
He also called out a woman named Mary because 'she's a s*** boss and doesn’t give a f*** about her employees,' and said others were 'unprofessional as f***.'
He concluded: 'F*** Target, f*** this store that never has s*** anyways, and f*** management. I quit, now go write an email about that, b****. '
Edwin captioned the video: 'Felt soooooo good. F South loop. But s/o to Harvey for not trynna stop me.'
He later uploaded several follow-up videos, including one of the 's***' mannequins he references. He also said he didn't face any consequences.
'Nothing actually ended up happening after this, I just put on my jacket, I put on my backpack, and I clocked out, and then I walked out. And then as I was walking out, I walked past security, and I heard Amanda, this b***, tell them to go to channel three [on their walkie-talkies] and then they went to channel three and she was telling them something about that she heard something on the speaker.
'But I was already walking out, so I'm sure as I was walking out they were putting two and two together,' he said.
He also shared that one of the things that 'drove me insane': how, during one shift, he got in trouble for retrieving his water bottle from another part of the store when he got thirsty.
'And this f***ing b**** stops me as I was getting my water and was making it seem as if I was loafing or doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing.
'And we had a meeting about it,' he went on, where he recorded what she said.
In the save voice memo, Linda can be heard saying that Edwin should have gotten his water when he was on a break.
'We have breaks and lunches for a reason,' she said. 'If you needed to get water, then you could have just asked,' ",-2
204,"Vials labeled 'smallpox' that were discovered in a freezer in a Philadelphia laboratory don't contain any traces of the deadly virus, federal health officials reveals.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday that testing showed the vials contain 'vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine' and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. 
The vials 'were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker' who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer on Monday night.
There were 15 vials in total - five of which were labeled 'smallpox' and the other 10 labeled 'vaccinia.' 
Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 with a successful mass vaccination campaign after it killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone.
Samples of the deadly virus are only supposed to be kept in two labs: the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Russia.  
Mark O'Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County.
It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. 
The CDC said it was 'in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization' about the findings.  
The finding was first reported by Yahoo News, which obtained a copy of an alert sent to the Department of Homeland Security labeled 'For Official Use Only.'  
Smallpox is a serious, life-threatening illness causes by variola virus.
A person may not look or feel sick for 7 to 14 days after exposure, but initial symptoms include high fever, headaches, backaches, and vomiting.
Around a third of people who contract the disease, die. 
After the initial symptoms, a body-wide rash appears. The person is most contagious during this stage.
Rashes develop in the tongue, mouth and throat. They then spread to the face and arms, torso and legs.
Pus-filled bumps, also called pustules, form and begin to scab over and fall off over a period of about 10 days.
It was mostly spread by prolonged face-to-face due to respiratory particles. The virus was also spread by sharing sheets, towels and clothing.     
Source: Cleveland Clinic 
After they were discovered, the vials were secured immediately and the facility was put on a lockdown that was lifted by Wednesday night.
'Merck is in the process of figuring out why it was there,' the source told NBC10 on Wednesday 
Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com.
'There is no indication that anyone has been exposed to the small number of frozen vials,' a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo. 
'The frozen vials labeled 'Smallpox' were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker while cleaning out a freezer in a facility that conducts vaccine research in Pennsylvania.'
The discovery took place at the Merck Upper Gwynedd facility in North Wales, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, according to WCAU. 
'CDC, its Administration partners, and law enforcement are investigating the matter, and the vials' contents appear intact. The laboratory worker who discovered the vials was wearing gloves and a face mask. We will provide further details as they are available,' the spokesperson said. 
The incident is likely to renew questions about what should be done with the world's Smallpox samples, which are kept in only two labs in the world. 
Smallpox is an infection caused by the variola virus. Patients develop a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash, according to the CDC.  
Most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, meaning an outbreak could have devastating consequences.  
The vaccine leaves a dime-sized lesion that gradually forms a scab and leaves a scar, the CDC says. The lesion is contagious before the scab forms, and those who receive it have to protect the vaccination site from other parts of their body and other people.
In 2014, a government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland - just outside of Washington, DC - found six decades-old glass vials containing freeze-dried smallpox, according to the Washington Post.
The samples were packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box. At the time, it was the first such discovery in the country. 
In 2019, an explosion at the state-owned Russian lab holding some of the samples sent one worker to the hospital, though the World Health Organization said the blast didn't occur near the stockpiles, according to NPR.  
Earlier this month, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said the US and UK should invest 'tens of billions' in virus research, including how to possibly prevent smallpox attacks from being unleashed in places like airports, according to Yahoo News. 
'So along with the climate message and the ongoing fight against diseases of the poor, pandemic preparedness is something I'll be talking about a lot,' he said in an interview with British health policy official Jeremy Hunt.
The origin of smallpox is unknown, but the earliest written description of a similar virus appeared in China in the 4th century.
It has typically worked in outbreaks and was brought to North America by European settlers in the 17th century.
About a third of infected patients died. Those who survived were sometimes left with various scars or even blind.
The 'basis for vaccination' began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had gotten cowpox were also protected from smallpox, according to the CDC.
In the 1800s, the virus used to make the smallpox vaccine changed from cowpox to vaccinia virus. (Five of the fifteen vials found in Philadelphia on Tuesday were labeled 'vaccinia.')
Before the vaccine, variolation was a common method of protection against the virus. People who had never had smallpox took material from pustules of infected people and scratched it into their arm or inhaled it through their nose to develop immunity. 
In 1948, the virus was infecting about 50 million people a year throughout the globe, according to the WHO. 
Experts estimate that the virus killed about 300 million people in the 20th century.
Soviet scientist Viktor Zhdanov proposed a four-year global vaccination campaign starting in 1959, and the campaign got a global boost aided by US funds in 1966 and 1967, with the Intensified Eradication Program.
'Laboratories in many countries where smallpox occurred regularly were able to produce more, higher-quality freeze-dried vaccine,' the CDC notes. 
'Other factors that played an important role in the success of the intensified efforts included the development of the bifurcated needle, the establishment of a case surveillance system, and mass vaccination campaigns.'
The last known naturally occurring case happened in 1977 in Somalia. The last natural US outbreak was in 1949. 
By 1980, the WHO declared the disease wiped out.
At this point, most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, according to Yahoo News.

205,"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democratic centrist who has been a thorn in President Biden's big spending agenda, on Friday said surging inflation justified her opposition and that she was baffled by critics who said her intentions were opaque.  
'No one tells me what to do,' she told the Washington Post in an interview.
She laid out her philosophy before the House passed a $1.75 trillion spending package, including green energy provisions and a stronger social safety net, sending it back to the Senate where she is one of the key votes that will make or break it. 
The legislation advances a raft of Democratic priorities. 
But Sinema has attracted the ire of her colleagues who say she has got her own way in paring back the original $3.5 trillion proposal yet still won't explain whether she slimmer version.
'So, that's not the agreement the president put out in his framework several weeks ago,' the senator said. 
'While I'm not going to comment on what's happening in the House at this moment, I can just refer you back to the comments I made when the president put out his framework. … I'm looking forward to working with him to get this done.' 
Where the other Democratic holdout Sen. Joe Manchin has spelled out his red lines, Sinema has given few interviews or answered questions about what it is that she wants. 
Her position even provided fodder for Saturday Night Live.
'What do I want from this bill?' asked Cecily Strong, playing Sinema. 'I'll never tell.'
For her part, Sinema said she did not understand the criticism.
'I'm always surprised when people say, 'Oh, she's an enigma,' she said. 
'I'm, like, not at all, actually. I'm very straightforward about what I believe in and why I'm doing what I do.' 
She pointed to the recent surge in inflation - last week the Department of Labor said prices had risen 6.2 percent since October 2020, the highest rise in more than 30 years - as justification for her stance. 
She said she hoped it 'helps people understand why I have been concerned about high levels of spending that are not targeted or are not efficient and effective.' 
The White House claims that its spending will increase productivity - by improving transportation or allowing more people to return to workforce through better childcare provisions, for example - reducing inflationary pressures.
Sinema disagrees with that analysis.
'The recent numbers on inflation are not a surprise,' she said. 
'We knew this was coming. And not everyone has paid attention to it or thought about it, but we've seen it coming. It's been coming for some time.' 
Her positions have long been interpreted as the work of a savvy politician who understands Arizona voters and who in 2018 found the centrist sweet spot for a state that had not elected a Democratic senator in 30 years.  
That is not good enough for the left of her party, who took particular umbrage in June when she publicly argued that the Senate should keep the filibuster. In a 50-50 Senate, it leaves much of Biden's agenda vulnerable to Republicans' blocking maneuvers.     
'My opinion is that legislation that is crafted together, in a bipartisan way, is the legislation that's most likely to pass and stand the test of time,' she said in the interview. 
'And I would certainly encourage my colleagues to use that effort to move forward.'
But Sinema rejected any idea that she had become an outlier in her own party, saying she takes positions that reflect the desires of her voters.
'I do not feel that at all,' she said. 'And it's because I live in Arizona … and folks are regular, everyday people in Arizona. Interestingly, people in other parts of the country don't lead with their political beliefs.'
Other Democrats worry that time is slipping away. They may not control the House or the Senate beyond next year's midterm election, and believe they may be about to squander the best chance in years to reshape the country.  
'I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that kind of grand talk,' Sinema said. 
'What I think about is: What are the folks in my state hungry for? What do they need? 
'How can I make their lives a little bit better? How can I make government less of a problem in their life? 
'And what are the things that I can do today to help solve that? And, you know, I think it works.'",-2
206,"Rejection can often be a step on the road to success.
Indeed, Fred Astaire was famously dismissed at a screen test with the words: ‘Can’t act; slightly bald; can dance a little.’
Well it turns out Ed Sheeran – now a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter with a £220million fortune – suffered the same humiliation at the age of 16…thanks to Dame Arlene Phillips.
The then schoolboy Edward took part in a televised audition to appear in ITV musical drama series Britannia High in 2007, where he performed Justin Timberlake’s Like I Love You.
However, his wooden dancing failed to impress the former Strictly judge who declared he was ‘not even an option’ to progress.
In a resurfaced clip of the failed audition, Sheeran can be seen dressed in a dark green jumper and jeans.
He stunned judges with his vocal ability and managed to get through to the second round.
But he struggled with the dancing element and Dame Arlene remarked: ‘Ed hasn’t got a clue what he’s doing, but he is trying.’
The teen Sheeran – who made it through just one round of the show – defended himself claiming: ‘I’m just trying to really get it in my head. I think I messed up as I got kicked in the face by accident.’
He was ultimately rejected for the show which aired for just one series.
Reflecting on the disastrous audition, Sheeran, now 30, told The Jonathan Ross Show: ‘This was a TV show I did for ITV when I was 16 and it was a show where you had to be a triple threat.
'You had to be able to act, dance and sing – two of which I couldn’t do. There is a girl who was at my high school and she was an incredible dancer.
'She taught me this dance which looked amazing when she did it…so I just copied what she did.
‘I walked out of the audition like “I think that went really well” and then I saw Arlene Phillips go “not a chance”.’
Sheeran – who has since sold more than 150million records worldwide – recently secured his fifth number one album with =.
Last week he made a cameo appearance in the film Red Notice which became the most watched movie ever in its opening weekend on Netflix.
And earlier this week he announced a collaboration with Pokemon Go – a mobile phone game which had more than one billion downloads by early 2019.",-2
207,"She is one of Britain's most brilliant actresses who is still, aged 88, winning rave reviews for her latest West End role. 
Now, in the first extract from our exclusive serialisation of her reissued and updated memoirs, Dame Sian Phillips reveals how she fell helplessly in love with the charismatic Peter O'Toole — and how their marriage began to be corroded by his drinking and obsessive sexual jealousy . . .
One night, in the early hours, I was woken by a noise coming from the ground-floor window of my front room in Notting Hill. I got out of bed without putting on the light.
Improbably, there was a face pressed to the glass and a tall ﬁgure perilously straddling the gap between the window and the steps to the front door.
I raised the sash slowly and two hands plunged in to seize the window frame. Then, with a heave, two long, slim feet swung down to the ﬂoor, and over 6ft of Peter O'Toole sketched a little bow.
I wanted to applaud. At the same time, I was astonished: we'd become close friends after acting together in a play, but had fallen out spectacularly.
I had innocently repeated to a friend something he'd told me about a former girlfriend — and when O'Toole found out, he had reacted with such fury that I never expected to see him again.
'I've got a car,' he said now. 'Coming for a cup of tea?'
'It's three in the morning.'
'So?'
'I'm in my nightie.'
'Put a mac on.'
That was the start, in 1958. We were in our early 20s and had no trouble adjusting our living habits to suit each other.
I'd never stayed up late, but came to love it. And he began to enjoy seeing the world in daylight hours — streets and parks as well as the dark interiors of bars.
The only slight difficulty was drink. Before meeting O'Toole, I'd never tasted beer, let alone whisky. I realised quickly that an appreciation of draught Guinness was essential in my new life and persevered, sipping the hated drink slowly during evenings when O'Toole drank his own age in the stuff.
Everyone we knew drank so much; incredible quantities of alcohol were lowered on every conceivable social occasion. Coming from a nonconformist, teetotal Welsh background, I was cautiously intrigued by the guilt-free, amusing nature of drinking to excess.
It was easy living together — and with wonderful sex thrown into the mix, it was ecstatic. While I played lead after lead in live television plays, O'Toole was in Willis Hall's The Long And The Short And The Tall, his ﬁrst big London success.
After the play, the company would move to the bar next door. When the pub shut, there would be a muttered conference and a large part of the crowd would drift off to parties in basement ﬂats, then hit the after-hours clubs.
The fag-end of the night was my favourite part. The two of us would walk to the all-night tea-and-sandwich stand in Covent Garden and order huge mugs of tea and hot-sausage sandwiches, which we ate sitting opposite Lloyds Bank.
Fortiﬁed, O'Toole would say, 'OK. Now for a little climb,' and he'd scale the wall of Lloyds.
The ﬁrst time he did this, I was terriﬁed and tried to dissuade him. But in a remarkably short space of time, I came to accept his dangerous behaviour as fairly unremarkable and would sit on the low wall with the tramps, nursing my tea, watching him.
He was sure-footed. And lucky. The regulars knew him as 'Pete' and gave him a little cheer as he ﬁnished the descent.
In our bedroom one day, O'Toole looked at my wardrobe of good clothes and said, 'You look as though you're in mourning for your sex life — all this black and violet. Give it here.'
It was late at night and raining as he gathered up armfuls of organza and wool, bags, shoes, gloves, frocks, hats and suits and, opening the window, ﬂung thousands of pounds' worth of clothes on to the wet cobbles below.
I had a momentary pang of regret. 'But what will I wear?' I asked.
'My clothes,' he said grandly, gathering me into his arms.
So we became the only couple in London who shared a wardrobe. Winter and summer, we wore cotton trousers, canvas shoes, lumberjack shirts and big knitted ﬁsherman sweaters. I had to roll his trousers up, of course, which made me look like a waif (he looked like a handsome pirate).
O'Toole's friends didn't approve of me. They felt his free spirit was being sucked into a conventional relationship and, with no special ill-will towards me, tried to put a stop to it.
I didn't mind. They weren't to know we had a new kind of equal partnership and that the last thing I had in mind was domesticity — as alien to me as it was to him.
My friends, advisers and employers were equally appalled and bluntly said that he would destroy my career, trample all over me.
They must be mad, I thought. I was deliriously in love. What could possibly go wrong?
During a break in Ireland in 1959, O'Toole suddenly clutched me and said, 'Have my children.' I instantly said, 'Yes.'
Five weeks later, it dawned on me that I must be pregnant. It turned out there was a conventional side to O'Toole after all: although he never proposed, he kept saying, 'We must arrange this marriage.'
Our wedding in Dublin was essentially an excuse for a p***-up. From pub to pub, we criss-crossed the city that night, gathering well-wishers. By 3am there were just ﬁve of us left, standing in a shebeen.
Was it marriage that changed him? Back in London, he would come grumpily home at night and sometimes go straight out again. Without me. Some nights, he didn't come home at all.
I knew what he was doing: he was leading the life we used to lead together, but now I was the wife and not really eligible. Nor, I realised, was he keen on me working, or at least not in leading roles.
I said nothing. All I'd ever wanted was to act — but the idea of a wife with a career, demanding rights, was laughable back then.
Then came an offer for O'Toole to play Shylock in The Merchant Of Venice in Peter Hall's new company. So in January 1960, as I neared the end of my pregnancy, we moved to Stratford-upon-Avon. We'd rented a big Edwardian house called Mount Pleasant (promptly re-christened 'Mount Unpleasant' by O'Toole).
Heavy now — and resenting it — I was surprised to ﬁnd that my free spirit, my equal partner, expected me to clean the house, wash, iron, provide meals and be on parade when needed.
Drink now became a dominant factor in our marriage. I made meals at night and threw them away uneaten before I went alone to bed. Often I'd wake to ﬁnd O'Toole asleep in an armchair, by an overturned glass.
In 1960, clever women shrugged tolerantly in the face of masculine stupidity. They knew if they complained, they would be branded as 'strident'. And when women did stamp and scream, they were laughed at. 'Stupid cow'. No one had any sympathy. But what happened next would have defeated me utterly, had I not understood that O'Toole was beside himself with nerves.
Word of his drinking habits had spread, and we knew his professional future depended on his performance as Shylock.
Although he was prepared, his moods became darker and more erratic. He justified this in a most unexpected way — by taking the moral high ground over my sexual past (no worse than that of most of the actresses he admired and respected).
Weeks went by with constant criticism of my morals. Even in public, he'd be savagely critical.
Why did I put up with this? In spite of everything, I believed O'Toole was worth it. I loved him; I also knew he'd had a terrible childhood and that a lot of his bad behaviour resulted from that. (He swore me to secrecy, so I'll never reveal what he told me.)
In any case, his occasional periods of sobriety brought wonderful interludes of repentance and irresistible charm, when I believed myself supremely loved and needed; but when I was made to feel like a useless encumbrance, I believed that just as fervently.
After the birth of our daughter, Kate, he visited the ward just once, bearing a white television set. There was no aerial. It sat in a corner, silent and glamorous.
I first met Rudolf Nureyev in 1962 but by our next meeting, he had become a huge star and partner to the ballerina Margot Fonteyn. 
At a dinner given in Belgravia, he arrived straight after a performance, picked up a small bottle of plum brandy and drained it in seconds. 
Next, he seemed to levitate on to the table and danced down its length, extending his arms and deftly but forcefully lifting off several women's false hair-pieces. 
Margot had now also arrived, smiling and imperturbable. 
I was pregnant and wearing a green Dior velvet dress and jacket, trimmed with heavy jet beads. 
The heat and excitement proved too much and, as I stood chatting to Margot, I knew I was going to faint. 
As I began to fall, I felt someone catch me. 
And when I regained consciousness, I was floating in a stairwell. 
Rudi, I realised, was carrying me above his head. 
He was drunk and I weighed a ton.
 He took me to a nursery and we chatted until he began to throw up violently. 
'Come on, mush,' barked O'Toole, as he seized Rudi's legs and began to bump him down the thickly carpeted stairs. 
There were cries of, 'Be c­areful! Take care of his feet.' 
'To hell with his f*****g feet,' muttered O'Toole.
One night, I woke to hear the sounds of drunken revelry from the grounds outside — O'Toole and a car full of actors had left the pub to come and serenade his daughter. Hoping no one would wake up and complain, I lay silently in the dark, looking at the ceiling until they went away.
Another day, I overheard my doctor talking to the Sister. Referring to a gypsy girl and me, he said, 'Keep both of them in. Neither has a suitable home environment.'
I couldn't look at my daughter for shame.
At home, there was a flow of people to cater for while I kept my eye on the clock for Kate's next meal. My mother-in-law paid a brief visit. It was hard not to react when she urged drink on her son. Didn't she know, 'Just one more small one, son' marked the beginning of the end of an evening?
Later, we had a visit from his father — a bookmaker from Leeds who was a feckless, occasionally violent drunk. I saw only the man O'Toole had told me about: the father sitting his little boy on the mantelpiece. Arms outstretched, he'd say, 'Jump, boy. I'll catch you. Trust me.'
When the child jumped, the father withdrew his arms and, as the child fell to the ﬂoor, he said, 'Never trust any bastard.'
O'Toole thought this was a good story. I found it despicable.
Producing a baby did nothing to improve my status. When a childhood friend of O'Toole's came to visit, my husband abused my character in front of me and then collapsed into a deep sleep.
His friend looked at me, picked up a big bowl of dressed salad, and smiled as he slowly emptied the oily contents on to the pale green carpet. Then he picked up a half-empty bottle of Scotch and, still smirking, sauntered to his bed in the guest room.
I picked up the salad, washed the carpet and fetched a rug to cover O'Toole, asleep in an armchair.
When Kate was four weeks old, I went to the opening of The Merchant Of Venice. 'One of the great nights in the theatre,' they called it. At the wild curtain calls, I sat with tears rolling down my face. Whatever it cost, I had to do all I could to help cherish this talent.
Soon afterwards, I opened in a play myself — The Taming Of The Shrew. The atmosphere at home worsened; the scenes resumed.
By the time Kate was nearly ﬁve months, our house had become a kind of ramshackle hotel for people who wanted to see the plays and stay over. O'Toole was lavish in his offers of hospitality but usually not there to attend to his guests. I muddled through from one nightmare meal to the next, constantly doing laundry and making beds.
Early one morning, after hours of close, drunken questioning about my past, O'Toole overturned a table. Doors slammed and his car sped erratically down the long drive.
I walked out of the house and lay in the wet, long grass on the lawn in my nightgown. It was almost dawn but I didn't feel the cold. My wish was to get ill and die. 'Let me just leave,' I said aloud.
As dawn broke, I heard the country noises around me and returned to my senses. Kate was inside, sleeping in her basket. What was I thinking of? So long as she was there, I'd have to be there for her. Getting up, I returned to the house and sat on the ﬂoor, leaning against the wall, waiting until she woke. It was never worth confronting O'Toole about his behaviour. But sometimes, unable to resist speaking up for myself, I'd add fuel to the ﬂames.
In a rage, he would erupt out of the house, running in bare feet across the dark Warwickshire ﬁelds while I stood alone, crying.
O'Toole knew, of course, that he was wiping out my self-confidence. At times, he would be remorseful and beg for forgiveness — though never for anything specific.
One day, he announced that my parents were taking Kate for a week and he and I were going to the west of Ireland. I was back in favour. Why? For how long?
In seconds, bags were packed, the fridge emptied, the car loaded. Then O'Toole held out his hand and I could no more resist him than stop breathing. Two days later, I was sitting in an Irish pub with him, totally happy with my decision to stay married.
For a while, the trip had a miraculous effect on our home life. Now, most nights after his show, Kate and I were invited to supper at a restaurant, where she slept in her basket under the table.
At times, O'Toole clutched at me as though his life depended on me. Then, every so often, our bubble of normality would be punctured by scenes of appalling verbal abuse.
I lost my precarious happiness. Sadness, which I didn't think to characterise as depression, crept closer. The criticisms of me grew more frequent and one night, I decided to leave.
The next day, I assembled Kate's things, packed and called a taxi.
It was over. Or so I thought . . .

208,"The National Police of Ecuador have launched a search for the former beauty queen daughter and a niece of a jailed gang leader who were allegedly kidnapped under the orders of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of Mexico’s two most powerful criminal organizations.
A surveillance camera shows the daughter of Los Choneros leader José Macías, 19-year-old Michelle Macías, struggling with one of her captors before she was shoved into the kidnappers’ getaway vehicle outside a beauty school in the port city of Manta on Wednesday evening.
The second victim has been identified as 21-year-old María Villavicencio.
Their whereabouts remained unknown as of Friday afternoon. 
Witnesses told authorities that saw Michelle Macías and Villavicencio being taken from the car that was used in the abduction and placed in another vehicle.
The car was set on fire by the kidnappers, who later forced Michelle Macías and Villavicencio into a speedboat and escaped.
Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio reported Friday that the kidnappings were a direct order from Nemesio ‘El Mencho’ Oseguera, the leader the Jalisco New Generation, for whom the U.S. government is offering a $10 million bounty. 
The outlet that the cartel accepted responsibility for the abductions and claimed it was the most powerful Mexican criminal organization operating in Ecuador, in a leaflet floated around the notorious Litoral Penitentiary in Guayaquil. 
However, most of the prison is under the influence of Macías' rival gang, Los Choneros. 
The group controls five of the Litoral Penitentiary’s 12 pavilions and is connected to the Sinaloa Cartel, the Mexican organization co-founded by El Chapo.
The gang is said to have been involved in the massacre of 68 inmates at the jail last weekend. 
A source with knowledge of the incident told digital news outlet Infobae that the kidnappings of El Fito’s daughter and niece may have also been in carried out as revenge for the murder of the 15-year-old daughter of the Los Lobos gang's leader, who is known as ‘El Sargento.'
The child’s killing was allegedly ordered by El Fito and his associate Alexander ‘Junior’ Roldan.
DailyMail.com could not confirm if Los Lobos is allied with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The gang does have control of one pavilion at the Litoral Penitentiary. 
El Comercio also reported that the Police Anti-Kidnapping and Extortion Unit has been in constant contact with El Fito to help rescue his daughter. 
For Mexican organizations such as the Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Ecuador is a fertile ground for supplying drugs to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world.
Ecuador is suffering a wave of violence at its prisons, which house some 39,000 people. 
President Guillermo Lasso has pinned the blame on the Mexican criminal factions.",-2
209,"Customers who were at a Starbucks in New Jersey this month are being told to get vaccinated against hepatitis A after an employee tested positive.
Anyone who purchased food or drinks from the Gloucester Township between November 4 and November 6 or between November 11 and 13 may have been exposed, according to the Camden County Department of Heath (CCDH).  
During those dates, the employee 'worked through the infectious period,' potentially spreading the illness to customers.
Out of an abundance of caution, health officials are recommending that anyone who visited the store be immunized.
Health officials visited the store and said they did not find any evidence of food safety violations.
The store was closed temporarily and did not reopen until all the employees were vaccinated. 
The CCDH is setting up a vaccine clinic to administer hepatitis A shots to Camden County Sustainable Facility on Friday and Saturday with shots available on a first come, first serve basis.
Customers who may have been infected are advised to come no later than 14 days after possible exposure.    
'The county health department has been working closely with the patient and the staff at the Starbucks to address the situation,' Camden County Health Officer Paschal Nwako said in a statement. 
'Our highest priority is ensuring everyone involved remains safe and healthy. The patient is not currently working, and close contacts have been identified.   
'We encourage anyone who may believe they were exposed to get vaccinated against hepatitis A by calling the county health department or your primary care physician.'
Hepatitis A is a virus that attacks the body through liver inflammation. It is highly contagious and is typically spread through sexual contact, needle sharing, or by consuming food that has been contaminated by someone infected with the virus.
Those who are at risk of developing hepatitis A include drug users, men who have sex with men and homeless individuals.
Symptoms - which include fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dark urine - can take anywhere from two to seven weeks after exposure to appear.
Although many who are infected show no symptoms, it can take a few months for the illness to pass.
Hepatitis A has been a recommended childhood vaccine since the mid-1990s. The vaccine consists of two doses administered six months apart.
Along with getting vaccinated, public health officials suggest strategies that include hand-washing with soap and water after going to the bathroom and before eating or preparing food.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis A cases rose nearly 300 percent from 2016 to 2018 in comparison with the same period between 2013 and 2015.
Researchers at the agency say this is largely due to outbreaks among the homeless population and among drug users.",-2
210,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting more than a half-century to review and release information to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to the public.
The agency is being sued by Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency, a group made up of more than 30 professors and scientists, hoping to access information they believe can help cure vaccine skepticism in some people.
A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was filed by the group in September and they were hoping the courts could expedite the process of getting them the requested information.
The FDA is asking the court to give them 55 years, or up to 2076, to gather and release the data to the general population.
The 1967 FOIA law requires federal agencies to respond to information requests within 20 business days. 
However, the time it takes to actually get the documents 'will vary depending on the complexity of the request and any backlog of requests already pending at the agency,' according to the government's central FOIA website.
The agency can not just deliver the documents to those that are requesting them, though.
They must first be reviewed by officials, and any information that could reveal personal information about participants in clinical trials, or sensitive information about Pfizer or BioNTech that could hurt their business dealings, would need to be redacted.
Justice Department lawyers representing the agency say that the request requires about 329,000 pages of information.
They argue that with that many pages to sift through, and the agency already dealing with around 400 FOIA requests, they need a long time to get the files requested ready.
The lawyers also report that the agency only has ten employees assigned with processing these types of requests.
In the meanwhile, the agency has proposed a plan to release 500 pages worth of information every month, which would take 55 years to complete.
'By processing and making interim responses based on 500-page increments, FDA will be able to provide more pages to more requesters, thus avoiding a system where a few large requests monopolize finite processing resources and where fewer requesters' requests are being fulfilled,' lawyers representing the agency wrote.
The attorney report that there have been other instances where the court allowed for this type of 500-page-per-month rollout of information.
Plaintiffs argue that the agency should be able to get them the information by March 3, 2022, in just over four months.
'This 108-day period is the same amount of time it took the FDA to review the responsive documents for the far more intricate task of licensing Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine,' wrote Aaron Siri of Siri & Glimstad in New York and John Howie of Howie Law in Dallas in court papers.  
'The entire purpose of the FOIA is to assure government transparency,'
'It is difficult to imagine a greater need for transparency than immediate disclosure of the documents relied upon by the FDA to license a product that is now being mandated to over 100 million Americans under penalty of losing their careers, their income, their military service status, and far worse.' 
To reach the March 3 goal, the agency would have to process around 80,000 pages every month.
The plaintiffs argue that their request should get priority over others, though, since it is in the public's interest for the information to be released.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the most commonly used in the U.S., and has the widest eligibility of any of the available shots.
It has been administered nearly 260 million times since it first became available around 11 months ago. 
With so many having received the shot, and so many claiming they are 'doing their own research' on the vaccines despite having little scientific expertise, the team of professors and scientists hope the release of this data will give people more confidence in getting the shot.
They also argue that the agency, with its $6 billion budget and 18,000 employees, has the resources necessary to release the information in a timely manner. ",-2
